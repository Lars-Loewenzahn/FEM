00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,440
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,640
Schülerhilfe learning videos. In 

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,480
this module, we look at 

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,460
the question of how to recognize good and 

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,440
better sources. And, are there 

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,920
any bad sources with 

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,760
false information? 

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,300
We will therefore first look at 

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,980
how you 

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,920
can recognize trustworthy sources . We 
will then look 

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
at how to evaluate sources 

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,140
using Wikipedia and 

13
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,240
forum posts as examples. Finally, we 

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,800
take a closer look at bad sources 

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,340
. We'll compare good and 

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,440
bad sources and look at 

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,520
examples. 

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,220
Let's start with how you 

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,860

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,980
can recognize trustworthy sources . In 
Module 3, you have already 

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,120
learned what characteristics a 

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
trustworthy source 

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,900
should have. There should be no 

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,660
spelling mistakes. 

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,180

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,940
There should be reputable and high-quality 
images 

27
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,040
. In addition, the structure should be 

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
clear and the link list 

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,440
well maintained. Beware of sites 

30
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,820
that do not have an imprint. 

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,560
The up-to-dateness of the page can also be 

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,500
an indicator of seriousness. 

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,020
Factual and neutral explanations 

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,000
as well as well-founded evaluations speak 

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,680
for a trustworthy source. 

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,420
First check what the aim of the 

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,140
website is . Is it a 

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,440
commercial site, i.e. is something being 

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,280
sold or advertised? Is it a 

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,440
purely informative site? Or is 

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,060
the aim of the site different? Who is 

42
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,460
the operator of the site? 

43
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,280
Is it a person, an 

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,400
organization or an association? 

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,760
Does the site 

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,820
cover current events, for example 

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,540
, or does it present a product? 

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,220
In any case, check the author and the 

49
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,980
imprint. What is the 

50
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,740
author 's name ? Is it an 

51
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,000
organization? What 

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,640
information does the imprint provide? If 
the 

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,960
operator of the site is a 

54
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,160
scientific institute, a 

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,240
public institution or a 

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,580
well-known expert, 

57
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,060
this indicates a trustworthy 

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,540
source. 

59
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,670
Let's take a closer look at the 

60
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,370
evaluation of sources. 

61
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,390
Wikipedia entries or forum posts 

62
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,590
should always be critically scrutinized 

63
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,010
, as the articles are mainly 

64
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,810
written and 

65
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,750
reviewed by private individuals. The 
content can therefore 

66
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,800
be incorrect. 

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,860
You should therefore 

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,340
not rely exclusively on Wikipedia for your 
research 

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,940
, but rather use it to get an 

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,960
overview and 

71
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,260
find other sources. 

72
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,300

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,820
Cite the sources found in the Wikipedia 
article as primary sources, but not the 

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,120
Wikipedia article itself. 

75
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,310
You need to be even more careful if 

76
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,770

77
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,490
you want to use information from forum 
posts. Because 

78
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,390
nothing is checked here. 

79
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,050
Therefore, 

80
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,530
always check information from Wikipedia or 
forums by 

81
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,210

82
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,470

83
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,090
comparing it with other sources such as 
books, magazines and websites. 

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,760
How can you recognize a good 

85
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,040
Wiki article? It should have a neutral 

86
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,180
and factual choice of words and 

87
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,900

88
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,500
deal with different points of view on the 
topic. It should 

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,380

90
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,120
offer the reader the opportunity to form 
an opinion. Sources should be 

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,380
carefully cited. Furthermore, 

92
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,920
there should be no contradictions 

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,160
. Let's 

94
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,740
now take a look at bad sources and 

95
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,460
how they compare to good 

96
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,770
sources. The first 

97
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,550
question is how to 

98
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,750
distinguish between relevant and 
irrelevant websites 

99
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,870
. Let's look at 

100
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,470
the example of the website www.bi-info.de. 

101
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,570
The following links on the subject of 

102
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,830
bees are displayed there. 

103
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,310
In the left-hand column, we see 

104
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,150
websites from official 

105
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,030
bodies such as universities, offices 

106
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,230
or institutions. In the right-hand 

107
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,930
column, the operators are either 

108
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,590
private or unclear. Websites 

109
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,410
from official bodies are always 

110
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,190
more reliable than those from private 

111
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,830
operators. 

112
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,840
Who operates the website 

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,580
and for what purpose? Look for a 

114
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,340
menu item that 

115
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,420
gives you information about this. You will 
often find something like 

116
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,140
about this site, about us, who 

117
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,880
we are or similar. Every 

118
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,780
website must contain 

119
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,720
a link to the so-called imprint on the 
main page 

120
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,340
. The official 

121
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,940
operator of the site is named there. 

122
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,520
Let's take the 

123
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,380
search engine fragfin.de as an example. If 
you 

124
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,040
scroll to the bottom of the page, you will 

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,760
find the links to FIN, 

126
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,280
Data protection and Imprint. This is 

127
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,680
a first indication of 

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,420
seriousness. 

129
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,620
However, take a closer look at these links 

130
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,780
to be able to assess the seriousness . 

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
Next, let's look at an 

132
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,980
example from Wikipedia of how to 

133
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,360

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,860
find out the type and purpose of a 
website. 

135
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,000
At the bottom of the Wikipedia homepage 
you will 

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,080
find the following information. 

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800
Under the link about Wikipedia 

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
you will find information about the 

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,260
type and purpose of this page. 

140
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,540
At the bottom of 

141
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,920
the page on Google you will also find the 
item about Google. 

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,840
On the following page you will find 

143
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,390
the legal notice. As an example, you can 
see 

144
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,790
the Google legal notice here. 

145
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,700
Once we 

146
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,300
have checked the website in general for 
seriousness, 

147
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,780
we turn to the content or the article 

148
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,060
in particular. Are there any details 

149
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,960
or references to the basis on which 

150
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,440
an article was created? 

151
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,400
Look for footnotes, 

152
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,100
sources or references at the end of the 
article. 

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,420
Embedded links in the 

154
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,250
article can also help. In Wikipedia 

155
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,590
 articles, you will find 

156
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,670
the subsections 

157
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,690
Underlying literature, Web links 

158
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,650
and Individual references in the table of 
contents. 

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,900
Check whether the content is correct. 

160
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,760
Compare the information 

161
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,740
on Wikipedia with other 

162
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,640
websites and, if possible, with 

163
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,440
a printed encyclopaedia or 

164
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,100
specialist literature. At the beginning or 
end 

165
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,560
of an article you will find 

166
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,540
various icons 

167
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,240
that can help you to 

168
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,680
better assess the quality of an article. 

169
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,540
There is a red icon with an L, a 

170
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,240
blue icon with an L and a 

171
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,840
green icon with a star. 

172
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,810
The red icon with an L means 

173
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,130
that the article 

174
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,250
needs to be revised and 

175
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,490
is therefore not a reliable source. The 
blue icon with an 

176
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,370
L means that the article is on a 

177
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,390
list of articles worth reading 

178
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,650
but does not yet meet the strict 

179
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,330
criteria. Nevertheless, 

180
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,110
the article has been 

181
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,560
edited to an above-average standard . The 
green icon with a 

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,520
star means that the article 

183
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,240

184
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,440
has been included in the list of excellent 
articles. It meets 

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,580
strict criteria and usually contains 

186
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,840
reliable information. 

187
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,840
Here you can see 

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,800
what such an icon 

189
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,500
looks like in an example article. 
Nevertheless, 

190
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,190
these 

191
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,510
awards should not be 

192
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,970
trusted blindly , as they are based on the 

193
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,150
ratings of other authors. This means that 

194
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,690
there is no absolute certainty 

195
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,510
that the content of the 

196
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,670
article is all correct. 

197
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,110

198
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,450
You can find out exactly how the rating of 
Wikipedia articles works 

199
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,310
at this link. 

200
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,040
In conclusion, it can be said that 

201
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,940
the hurdle is high for a source to be 

202
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,280
rated as reputable and of high quality 

203
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,760
. So, yes, 

204
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,040
there are sources with false 

205
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,350
information. Thank you for your 

206
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,490
attention and good luck with 

207
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,630
evaluating sources.
