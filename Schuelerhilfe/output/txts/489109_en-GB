00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,690
Hello, welcome to 

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,870
another learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,830
Today I would like to 

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:07,430

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,290
introduce you to a very important Latin 
verse meter , the lactilian 

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,110
hexameter. It is very important for you 

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,950
to know that Latin 

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,650
poetry, in contrast to German poetry 

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,790
, is based on the fact that a regular 

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,530
rhythm is created by a 

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,090
certain fixed sequence of 

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,670
lengths and contractions. In German, 

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,250
we would rather 

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,870
work with stressed and unstressed 
syllables. And it is precisely 

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,650
this sequence that is determined by 

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,910
the so-called meter, the measure. 

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,210
You may be familiar with 

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,750
iambus, trocheus, 

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,530
dactylus and anapest from your German 
lessons. 

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,890
Let's take a 

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,070
closer look at the name dactylic hexameter 

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,950
and where it comes from. The word dactylus 

23
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,070
actually comes from the Greek 

24
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,590
and has a kind of dactyl meaning 

25
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,630
finger . And now you 

26
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,890
might be asking yourself , what does a 
finger have to do with 

27
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,750
poetry? Yes, let's take 

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,210
a look at this 

29
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,650
finger of a skeleton that I 

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,230
have drawn for you. You can see that 

31
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:19,170
the lower bone is long and the 

32
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,210
two following bones are short. 

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,990
And that's what actually 

34
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,910
makes a dactylus a meter. 

35
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,970
We have a length first. 

36
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,770
So you see, we mark lengths 

37
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,990
with this line over the vowel 

38
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,790
or over the syllable and then 

39
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,750
1 or 2 shortenings follow. And you can 
also see that we 

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,010
mark shortening with this semicircle 

41
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,430
above the syllable, i.e. above the vowel 

42
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,410
of the short. And finally, we have 

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,530
a third sign, 

44
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,350
this accent, which always indicates 

45
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,690
that this syllable is stressed. 

46
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,190
This means that the dactyl 

47
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,330
does not only consist of a long, short, 

48
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,670
short syllable, but the first 

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,170
syllable, the length, is also 

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,110
stressed. Then we come to the 

51
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,850
hexameter. The word hexa 

52
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,430
comes from the Greek and means 6, and 

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,380
meta is the measure. So in 

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,900
dactylic hexameter we have a verse 
measure, 

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,060
a verse that consists of six 

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,430
hexadactyls. I have 

57
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,050
shown you here what a 

58
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,890
dactylic hexameter 

59
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,090
looks like in row form. We would have 1, 
2, 3, 4, 

60
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,190
5, 6 dactyls. If you now take a 

61
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,430
look at the last verse 

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,710
, you will of course notice that 

63
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,990
a syllable is somehow missing here. What 

64
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,270
happened there? Something very typically 

65
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,270
Latin. The last verse foot of 

66
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,710
a Latin verse is often shortened by 

67
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,890
one syllable. This phenomenon, 

68
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,770
this shortening, is also called 

69
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,710
catalexis. We 

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,960
say that the last foot of the verse is 

71
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,100
catalectic. And this X, which 

72
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,140
has not yet been encountered 

73
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,640
, is a so-called syllaba ankeps. 

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,560
Ankeps means double-headed, 

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,580
two-faced, double German, and 

76
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,340
like the god Janus, who also 

77
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,360
has two faces, this 

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,320
syllable on Caps can 

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,350
be either long or short. Now of course it 
would be 

80
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,190
very boring if I 

81
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,530
only 

82
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,410
had this hexameter scheme all the time and 
of course I would also have 

83
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,310
a problem, how am I supposed to 

84
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,190
find words that correspond exactly to it? 

85
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,110
Long, short, short, long, short, short. 

86
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,330
That's why there are variations. 

87
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,510
I'll show you a few of them. 

88
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,810
First, let's look at the 

89
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,490
hexameter in row form. Das wäre 

90
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,050
quasi ein Bau-Baba-Bau-Baba-Bau-Baba 

91
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,070
-Bau-Baba-Bau-Baba-Bau-Bu-Bu 

92
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,910
-Söllerwagen-Kips. Or the variant 

93
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,110

94
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,690
Bau-Baba-Baba-Bau-Bau-Bau-Bau-Baba-Bau-Baba-Bau-Bu. 
Or another 

95
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,250
variant. 

96
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,770
What do we notice? 

97
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,970
We have a double short here and 

98
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,850
a long in the following verse. Similarly 
here 

99
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,910
double short and here one long. 

100
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,470
Length. So what has happened? 

101
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,310
In fact, every now and then we can 

102
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,530
replace a double short with a 

103
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,130
long. You see here again, this 

104
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,090
is our dactyl and yes, because every 

105
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,190
thing likes to have a name, 

106
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,690
we call this meter two lengths, first 

107
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,330
emphasized, a spondius. 

108
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,690
What's important, however, is that you'll 
notice this 

109
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,890
if you take a 

110
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,330
look at the penultimate verse foot 

111
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,290
, the fifth 

112
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,690
verse foot. There we have 

113
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,550
our dactylus consistently everywhere. This 
is because, as 

114
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,170

115
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,730
a rule, the 

116
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,030
basic meter 

117
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,790
is preserved in its pure form in the 
penultimate verse foot of a verse . So 
here is the dactyl. 

118
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,790
Long, short, short. That was the first 

119
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,030
part of our introduction to the 

120
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,850
hexamite. In the second part, I will 

121
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,130
explain to you when syllables 

122
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,750
are actually long. And 

123
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,330

124
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,510
illustrate the whole thing with a 
practical example. Well, see you then. 
Bye.
