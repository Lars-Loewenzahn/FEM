1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,320
Once the parents and the student 

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,500

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,240
have decided to register , the student can 
be 

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,220
created in ICAS 7 and the initial 
diagnosis can 

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,800
be initiated. 

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,480
It is important for the initial 
diagnostics that 

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,960
a 

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,760
valid e-mail address 

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,320
is entered in the student's master data. 
In order for the dispatch to 

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,900
work successfully, it must be ensured 

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,740
that this e-mail address is only 

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,920
stored once in the system and 

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,860

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,600
has been uniquely assigned to a student . 
If necessary, 

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,420
you must also check whether the e-mail 
address 

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,080
is already 

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,060
being used by a sibling or an inactive 
account 

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,040
. The initial diagnostics 

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,740
can be found under the Extras tab in 

20
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,600
the student's profile. To 

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,360
initiate a new test, 

22
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,220

23
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,420
click on the plus sign in the top 
right-hand corner of the Incoming 
diagnostics field . Without having 

24
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,860
to use the filters, 

25
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,720
the learning checks are displayed at the 
top. 

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,700
The learning check is 

27
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,420
then selected based on the class level. 

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,080
A 

29
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,680
tick is placed next to the appropriate 
learning check. The franchise 

30
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,080
 partners can then choose whether 

31
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,500

32
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,740
or not the evaluation of the learning 
check is sent to the student. 

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,840
of the learning check. 

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,260
A suitable subject check is then selected 
for the 

35
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,040
student. To do this, 

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
click on Add test again, 

37
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,360
then 

38
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,960
use the filter function at the top to 

39
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,340
search by subject and grade level or 
learning year. 

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,820
In Latin and French, there are 

41
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,940
subject checks for learning years 1 to 4, 

42
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,220
as the foreign languages 

43
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,480

44
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,440
can start at different grade levels. The 
subject checks for 

45
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,040
the main subjects of mathematics, German 

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,440
and English can best 

47
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,540
be selected using the filter function. 
After selecting 

49
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,740
the subject and the 

50
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,680
Standardized subject check category , 

51
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,160
a distinction can then 

52
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,660
be made between class levels , whereby two 

53
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,340
class levels have been combined in each 
case in 

54
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,020
order to also 

55
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,080
test the pupils ' previous knowledge . In 
the area of math, 

56
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080

57
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,340
two additional versions are 

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,300
offered for grades 7 and 8 , as the 
subject matter here is very 

59
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,160
extensive. 

60
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,640
The 

61
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,560
next school-leaving qualification 

62
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
the pupil is aiming for is shown in 
brackets after each subject check. The 

63
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,620
subject check can therefore be selected 

64
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,100
based on the grade level, 

65
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,680
personal assessment and 

66
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,640
type of school. If 

67
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,880
you are unsure 

68
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,360
which subject check is the right one, you 

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,940
can also 

70
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,880
initiate several tests. Here too, 

71
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,500
franchise partners can 

72
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,040
choose whether the evaluation of the 
subject check 

73
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,780

74
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,680
should be sent automatically to the 
student. 

75
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,060
The subject check is then sent to the 

76
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,680
student by clicking on Save. Once the 
tests 

77
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
have been initiated, they appear 

78
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
under the Incoming diagnostics tab. 

79
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,860

80
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,620

81
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,040
The status of the test 

82
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
, i.e. whether the student 

83
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,220
has started working on it, can be viewed 
using the three overlapping dots on the 
far right. 

84
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,800
The test can also be deleted 

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,780
or resent there if necessary. 

86
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,740
If the test is resent 

87
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,380

88
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,720
, the timestamp is automatically updated. 
If 

89
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,140
the mouse 

90
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,900
is moved over the timestamp , a 

91
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,940
tooltip opens. This gray 

92
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,240
box shows the dispatch history 

93
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,620
, when the test was sent for the first 
time 

94
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,560
and when it was sent again. 

95
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,180
After initiating the tests, the 

96
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,040
student receives two separate emails 

97
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,720
, each with a link that takes them to the 

98
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,320
processing page for the learning and 

99
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,920
subject check. The tests can be completed 

100
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,700
from home. 

101
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,380
Completing the learning check 

102
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,940
takes a maximum of 15 to 20 minutes. 

103
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,440

104
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,740
A maximum of 60 minutes is 

105
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,020
available to complete the subject check. 

106
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,760
An evaluation is automatically 

107
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,580
generated after each learning or subject 
check. This is sent by e-mail to 

108
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,320
the student and the 

109
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,160
head teacher. In the case of 

110
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
franchise partners, it is 

111
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
only sent to the student if 

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,980
they have been selected beforehand. In 

113
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,760
ICAS, the results can be 

114
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,600

115
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,980
viewed by both the tutor and the tutor 

116
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,080
. This can also be done again in the 

117
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
student's profile under the 

118
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,260
Extras tab in the 

119
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,100
Incoming Diagnostics tile under the 

120
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,360
paper clip symbol. In the evaluation 

121
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,800
of the learning checks, the results are 

122
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
displayed in a bar chart. 

123
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,160
If the student 

124
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,140
does not 

125
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,100
perform well or less well in individual 
learning areas, 

126
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,980
support options are automatically 
suggested. 

127
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,620
In the evaluation of the subject check 

128
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,500
, incorrectly answered questions are 
marked in red 

129
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,280
so that they can 

130
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,160
be recognized at a glance. 

131
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
The correct 

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,740
answer is shown in blue brackets . Correct 
answers are 

133
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,460
marked in green. The 

134
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,320
tutor can pick up on this and 

135
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,820

136
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,920
discuss the results in the first lesson.
