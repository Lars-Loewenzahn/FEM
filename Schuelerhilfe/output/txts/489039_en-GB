00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,120
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,400
This video is about 

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,340
adverbial clauses. Adverbial clauses are 

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,960
subordinate clauses 

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,020
that take on the syntactic function of an 
adverbial. 

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,660
An adverbial clause can 

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,300

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,760
have different senses , such as causal or 

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,240
temporal. 

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,980
Adverbial clauses 

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,380
are introduced by subjunctions, which 
indicate the 

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,540
sense of the respective 

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,940
subordinate clause. For example, 

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,700
cum, ut, quod or stupid. 

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,540
There are other subjunctions, which I 

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,120
will discuss in more detail below. 

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,620
There are many different 

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,460
adverbial clauses. 

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,240
First , let's look at the temporal 
clauses. 

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,520
Temporal clauses answer the question 

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,000
when. 

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,450
They therefore represent a time 
relationship 

24
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,690
. Subjunctions for temporal clauses 

25
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,290
would be, for example, postquam for 

26
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,230
after or cum for as, after 

27
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,230
or while. Cum 

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,430
is often used with the subjunctive at this 
point. 

29
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,950
I have 

30
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,730
brought you an example of temporal clauses 
. Postquam te 

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,890
vidi, donum reverti. 

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,270
After I had seen you, I went back 

33
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,590
home. Here you can see the 

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,570
subjunctive. Now let's take a 

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,870
closer look at causal clauses. A causal 
sentence 

36
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,110
always answers the question why. 

37
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,430
It therefore gives a reason. 

38
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,130
Subjunctions for causal clauses would be 

39
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,270
quia for da or weil, quoniam for 

40
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,810
weil ja and others. 

41
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,990
I have also 

42
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,710
brought you an example sentence for this . 
Quoniam ad est tu solos 

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,610
non sum. Because you are there, I am 

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,010
not alone. Here you can see the 

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,730
subjunction quoniam. 

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,120
Now let's move on to the 

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,140
concessive clauses. Concessive clauses 

48
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,360
always express a restriction. 

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,240
An example of a subjunction 

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,340
would be quam quam for although. 

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,880
I have also 

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,300
prepared an example sentence for this. 
Quam quam, agento 

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,580
, cario, contentus, sum. Although I 

54
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,620
have no money, I am content. 

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,440
Here the subjunction, quam quam. 

56
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,170
Now we come to the modal sentences. 

57
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,110
Modal clauses answer the question 

58
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,110
how and thus 

59
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,090
express a manner. An example of a 

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,190
subjunction of modal sentences would be 

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,410
I 

62
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,050
brought an example sentence. 

63
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,390
By praising the pupil 

64
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,190
, the teacher is making him happy. Here 
you can see the 

65
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,610
subjunction cum. 

66
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,400
Conditional sentences answer 

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,600
the question under which condition 
something 

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,820
happens. An example of a 

69
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,280
subjunction of conditional clauses would 
be 

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,340
sie with the translation wenn. 

71
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,280
At this point, you should note 

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,400
that the subjunctive in sie setzen 

73
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,300
is translated as in the main clause. 

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,080
I have also 

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
provided you with an example sentence for 
this. 

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
If you go away, I will 

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,960
be very sad. Here you can see the sie. 

78
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,680
Let's take a look at the final clauses 

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,440
. Final clauses are always in the 

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,200
subjunctive mood and 

81
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,160
express a purpose. They answer the 
question of 

82
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,320
the purpose for which something happens. A 

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,600
subjunctive for final clauses 

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,320
is, for example, ut. For the translation 

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,440
damit or um zu. 

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,860
You have to eat to get full. In 

87
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,220
this example, you can see the 

88
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,660
subjunction ut. Now let's move on to 

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,820
consecutive clauses. Consecutive clauses 

90
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,700
always express a sequence. They 

91
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,620
answer the question as to the 

92
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,060
sequence with which something happens. An 
example 

93
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,640
of a subjunctive of 

94
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,580
consecutive clauses is ut. 

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,280
I have also 

96
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,640
prepared an example sentence for this. 

97
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,780
I hide so that 

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,480
nobody sees me. Here is the 

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
subjunctive ut. 

100
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,770
Let's move on to the 

101
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,190
adversative clauses. Adversative clauses 

102
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,290
always indicate a juxtaposition 

103
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,310
. An example of a subjunctive 

104
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,490
would be KUM. With the translation WÄHREND 

105
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,710
or WOHINGEGEN. KUM MATER LIBERAS 

106
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,230
EDUKET PATER LABORAT While the 

107
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,230
mother raises the children, 

108
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,710
the father works. Here you can see the 

109
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,510
subjunction KUM. With the translation 

110
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,210
WÄHREND. 

111
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,680
Comparative clauses 

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
indicate a comparison. An example of a 
subjunctive 

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,800
would be ITER-UT with the translation SO 

114
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,940
-WIE. The subjunctive here is 

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,660
either IREALES or POTENTIALES. 

116
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,180
I have also 

117
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,000
prepared an example sentence for this. 

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,860
As you make your bed, so you sleep. 

119
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,340
In this example sentence, you can see 

120
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,000
that O and I can also 

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,980
be put the other way around. Let me 

122
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,600
summarize once again what 

123
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,300
this video was about. I have 

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,320
made it clear to you that adverbial 
clauses 

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,160
are subordinate clauses 

126
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,280

127
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,160
that can take on the syntactic function of 
an adverbial. 

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,480
Adverbial clauses are always introduced by 

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,520
subjunctions. 

130
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,880
You should always 

131
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,580
pay attention to the mode. This is because 
it makes a 

132
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,060
difference whether a subjunction 

133
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,160
is in the indicative or the subjunctive 
mood 

134
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,220
. It can lead to a 

135
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,680
change in meaning. I 

136
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,140
have written down another tip for you. In 
the 

137
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,420
main clause, you will often find words 

138
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,660
that indicate the direction of meaning 

139
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,660
. 

140
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,440
There is also a concluding remark for this 
video. In 

141
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,400
Latin, 

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,420

143
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,700
sentence-final constructions with 

144
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,640
infinite verb forms are often used instead 
of adverbial clauses . 

145
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,600
Thank you for your attention 

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,780
and see you next time. mal
