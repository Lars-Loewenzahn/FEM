00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,210
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,090
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,350
This video is about the 

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,470
underlining method. The 

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,930
underlining method 

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,410
is particularly helpful when translating 

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,690
longer texts in order to 

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,490
illustrate the text. With the 

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,410
underlining method 

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,370
, the first thing we do is look for all 
verbal information 

11
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,650
in the text. This means that we 

12
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,310
mark all predicates, i.e. 

13
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,690
all finite verb forms. 

14
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,030
We also mark the 

15
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,790
introductory words of subordinate clauses 
and 

16
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,750
the non-finite verb forms, which then 

17
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,130
indicate sentence-value constructions. 

18
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,570
To 

19
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,270
continue the underlining method , I have 

20
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,870
brought you the following example, which 

21
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,350
comes from Caesar's Debello Gallico. 

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,150
To 

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,550
translate this somewhat convoluted, longer 
passage of text, 

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,590
let's first look at the 

25
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,370
finite verbs. form, i.e. the 

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,550
predicates. You can see these 

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,370
marked in orange here in the text. It's 
important to note 

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,170
that the indicator at the back 

29
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,490
is the personal ending so that you 

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,550
can find the predicates. 

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,270
Next, let's take a look 

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,790
at the corresponding subjects. These 

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,990
can also 

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,010
be contained in the personal endings , 
otherwise the 

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,150
subjects in the case are nominative. 

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,010
In this case, we can see that Helvetii is 

37
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,050
a subject and Ipsi too, with 

38
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:53,430
Ipsi referring to Helvetii. In the first 

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,890
step, we also mark all the 

40
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,250
introductory words of subordinate clauses, 

41
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,630
here Cum, Quod and Ut, which 

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,550
indicate that a 

43
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,830
subordinate clause follows. Then we can 
also 

44
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,190
mark all subordinate clauses separately, 
for 

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,790
example with square brackets. Then 

46
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,890
we can see when a clause begins 

47
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,370
and where it ends. Here you can see the 

48
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,070
quad as a relative pronoun, which refers 

49
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,970
to it, it could also be a 

50
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,730
factual quad, in which case it would 

51
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,870
be translated differently. 

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,550
Next, in the second step, 

53
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,010
we look at all 

54
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,610
non-finite verb forms, for example 

55
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,850
here comotia. This shows us that 

56
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,950
we have a partikipium conjunctum, or 

57
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,370
PC for short. It is important that there 

58
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,630

59
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,350

60
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,490
is always a reference word in such a 
sentential construction or in such a 
conjunctive participle . 

61
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,010
This is then in KNG congruence with 

62
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,170
Komotii and we see that it is 

63
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,210
Helvetii, we 

64
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,250
then also mark the reference with an 
arrow. Since these 

65
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,210
two Helvetii and Komoti 

66
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,870
form a frame position and the rest 

67
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,250
of this sentential construction 

68
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,110
is in the middle, we can 

69
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,410
also 

70
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,930
put square brackets around it 

71
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,830
to 

72
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,370
separate the conjunctive particle from the 
rest. Next, we see 

73
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,610
that there is also 

74
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,490
another non-finite verb form. 

75
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,650
Below here is the fekisse, which is an 

76
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,210
infinitive, and because we then 

77
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,050
see the inteleggerent, which 

78
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,510
is an ACI trigger verb, understand that 

79
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,930
means, for example, we 

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,250
then recognize that 

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,730
there is also an ACI below here. We have 
marked this 

82
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,190
in green here. There is also 

83
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,090
a reference word for this , the 

84
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,990
subject accusative "-ilum", which we 

85
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,650
then also mark in green and 

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,210

87
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,910
illustrate the reference again with an 
arrow . Now you can already see 

88
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,690
that an 

89
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,570
object is missing at the same level. In 

90
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,950
this case , the object is "-it", which 

91
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,740
is at the top here, and 

92
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,360
we can see from this that the first 
subordinate clause 

93
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,220
"-cum it" above 

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,020
is on the same level as Illum uno de 
verkisse 

95
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,700
intelegger and that these two 

96
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,500
parts belong together. Cum it 

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,140
lacks a predicate anyway, 

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,740
so it is not a complete 

99
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,140
subordinate clause. We can now 

100
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,760
mark the ACI with 

101
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,080
square brackets again so 

102
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,700
that we know that it is present here. 

103
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,070
Next, let's move on to the 

104
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,630
translation. You can 

105
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,170
already see it displayed here in full and 
I'll 

106
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,610
read it out once. The Helvetii 

107
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,510
were 

108
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,250
very moved by his sudden arrival , because 
when they realized 

109
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,010
that he, Caesar, 

110
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,030

111
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,250

112
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,550

113
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,650

114
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,610
had done in a single day what they 
themselves had only accomplished with 
extreme difficulty in 20 days , namely to 
cross the river or that they had crossed 
the river, they 

115
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,410
sent envoys to him. 

116
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,050
Now this is a big flood 

117
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,510
of translation. You would 

118
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,970

119
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,270
proceed step by step in your translation. 
It is easiest if 

120
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,330
you first translate the predicates 

121
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,710
and then the introductory words of 

122
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,490
the subordinate clauses, just as we did 

123
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,070
in the first step. 

124
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,510
Let's take 

125
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,290
a closer look at these introductory words. 

126
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,350
First you see the cum was 

127
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,690
translated because or as. 

128
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,890
Then comes the quod, which 

129
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,330
is translated as was. 

130
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,480
And the O-phrase, which in this case is 

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,420

132
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,740
translated with. with nämlich and zu, i.e. 
with an infinitive, or 

133
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,720
with the possibility in brackets, where 

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
it is translated more literally and is 

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
then introduced with das. Once you 

136
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
have translated all the predicates and 

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,780
have already 

138
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,240
written down and 

139
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,040
formulated the introductory words of the 
subordinate clauses , 

140
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,760
simply fill in the rest of your 
translation with 

141
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
the text. It is also important to note 

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
how I 

143
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,700
have translated the conjunctive participle 
. In this case, I have 

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,060
translated it as an order. 

145
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,880
You can see that below. And, 

146
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,580
therefore or and thereby. That was 

147
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,340

148
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,520
chosen here as the order for the 
conjunctive participle. 

149
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,880
So there are two main clauses. 

150
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
Of course, you can 

151
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,060
choose how you 

152
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,640
want to translate it and how it 

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,900
sounds best . It is also important to note 
that 

154
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,020
different senses 

155
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,040
can be chosen here. Therefore, 

156
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,100
for example, causal, you could also 

157
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,440
choose temporal. 

158
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
It is also important that you don't use 
the 

159
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,620
interlacing 

160
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,320
found in the original text in the 

161
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,560
German translation. 

162
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,380
Thank you for your 

163
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,460
attention. Bye, see you 

164
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,960
next time.
