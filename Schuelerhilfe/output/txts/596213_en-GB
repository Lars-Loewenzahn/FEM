00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,020
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,560
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,540
This module is about citations and 

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,080
bibliographies. How to 

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,480
cite sources correctly. 

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,420
In this module, we will look 

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,400
at why you actually 

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,660
have to cite sources , how to cite 
correctly 

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,700
and what is important in a 

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,280
bibliography. 

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,690
Citing sources. Why actually? 

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,890
All 

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,510
thoughts from or references to 

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,690
other constitutions must 

15
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,090
be identified, i.e. cited . 

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,550
This serves the purpose of verifiability. 

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,650
The principles of citation are 

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,410
directness. Quotations must be taken from 
the 

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,830
original source. 

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,990
Appropriateness. Use quotations that only 

21
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,570
contain what the author 

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,010
wishes to substantiate. Accuracy. 

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,990
Sources should be sufficiently and 

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,430
clearly identified. 

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,140
Citation. How to do it right. 

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,740
There are different ways of citing. 

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,560
Please note that citations must always be 
cited 

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,980
consistently. 

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,080
So only ever use one 

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,020
citation style. The 

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,780
citation forms presented here are 
suggestions from the 

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,460
student help service. It is possible that 

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,180
your teacher 

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,280

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,720
may want different guidelines for citing . 

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,690
When and how should citations be made? 

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,270
In a literal quotation, sentences, 

38
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,130
parts of sentences, terms and definitions 

39
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,830
are used verbatim. The literal 

40
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,710
quotation must be placed in quotation 
marks 

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,070
and must 

42
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,790
correspond to the original text. The 
grammar 

43
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,350
must not be changed either. 

44
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,750
An indirect or analogous quotation 

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,070
is a reproduction of the content in 

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,670
your own words. It is 

47
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,070
identified by the addition "compare". 

48
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,990
The scope of the 

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,590
quotation must be made clear. 

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,430
References merely refer to 

51
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,070
another text. References 

52
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,810
are mainly used when you 

53
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,510
do not 

54
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,770
want to go into more detail about the 
text. 

55
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,530
Citations must be identified in two ways 

56
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,410
. Firstly, as a 

57
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,390
short reference in the text. The 

58
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,270
reference is placed in 

59
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,130
brackets directly after the quotation and 
secondly as a 

60
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,230
full reference in the bibliography. 

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,540
The bibliography. The 

62
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,170
bibliography is a 

63
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,150
list of all 

64
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,870
sources cited in the text. Direct and 

65
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,910
indirect citations must be included. 

66
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,230
A bibliography 

67
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,030
is part of every academic 

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,170
paper. It is 

69
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,030
inserted at the end of the paper on a new 
page. When 

70
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,480
creating a 

71
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
bibliography 

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
, the following must be observed. The 
references are to be 

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,760

74
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,700

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,060
sorted in alphabetical order according to 
the surnames of the first authors. Works 

76
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,940
written by the first author alone are 

77
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,980

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,040
listed before works with other authors 
listed after them. Works by a 

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,080
first author with different co-authors 

80
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,340
 are 

81
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,000

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,800
to be sorted alphabetically according to 
the surnames of the second or further 
co-authors. In the case of 

83
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,890
works by one author or several 

84
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,130
authors from different years 

85
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,850
, the sources should be 

86
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,610
sorted chronologically according to the 
year of publication. The 

87
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,410
oldest publication therefore comes 

88
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,190
first. For works by the same author 

89
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,390
from the same year, the sources should be 

90
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,550

91
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,890
sorted according to the first letter of 
the title of the article. The 

92
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,670
sources should then be 

93
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,910
numbered with lower case letters , which 

94
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,030

95
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,150

96
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,450
are placed in brackets immediately after 
the year of publication . 

97
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,520
Internet sources are listed according to 
the 

98
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,980
following pattern. Surname, 

99
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,480

an author are 

114
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,210

Winklers Verlag in Braunschweig. If there 
are 

122
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,130
several authors, their names are 

123
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,530
listed one after the other. In the case of 

124
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,560
