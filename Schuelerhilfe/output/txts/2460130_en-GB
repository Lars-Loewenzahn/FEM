00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,120
Today's topic is school.

00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,160
I'm going to show you a few terms 

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,420

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,800

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,600
a pupil and une élève is a 

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,220
student. With une élève, make sure 

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,360
you pronounce the N because 

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,380
it is followed by a vowel. Then we have 

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,980
la professeur 

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,320
or simply la prof is the teacher and le 

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,940

Le stylo is simply the pen 

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,200

colored pencil. Le crayon de couleur. 

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,680
All these pens go in your pencil 

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,760
case and that is called la trousse. 

31
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,350
