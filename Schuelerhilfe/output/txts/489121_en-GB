00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello to another learning video from 

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,860
Schülerhilfe . After 

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,020
explaining to you in the last videos how a 

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,120
lactylic hexameter is structured 

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,640
and what I have to pay attention to, 

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,200
this time it's about a few special 
features 

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,080
that you have to pay attention to in 

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,040
Scandian. So let's take a look 

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,720
at these special features. Yes, very 

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,160
important, avoid the hiatus. And you 

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
might be asking yourself, what is 

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,800
a hiatus? A hiat occurs 

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,500
when two vowels collide. 

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,260
This is when a word 

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,960
ends with a vowel and the next word 

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,120
begins with a vowel. So the question is, 

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,680
how do we avoid this 

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,200
clash? There are two 

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,940
possibilities. 

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,010
Firstly, and this is the 

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,010
most common and most important option, 

22
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,950
we use an elysion. 

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,430
Elysion is sometimes also 

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,150
 called Syn-a-loy -phä. But you 

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,130
don't necessarily need to know the word. 
Importantly, 

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,030
elysion comes from the Latin 

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,510
elidere. Elidere, elido, elisi, 

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,590
elisum, to knock out. And I've 

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,710
illustrated this for you here with these 

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,410
frogs. 

31
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,890
Just imagine that a frog here 

32
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,550
corresponds to any vowel. 

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,550
So, case 1: The first word ends 

34
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,370
with a vowel and the second word 

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,390
begins with a vowel. What 

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,110
happens then? The first vowel is 

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,310
knocked out. It disappears. 

38
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,350
You simply don't measure it. 

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,050
A special feature of 

40
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,230
Latin is that a word is considered to 

41
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,890
have a vowel sound even if it 

42
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,340
ends in a vowel plus an M. Here, too, 

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,420
what happened in the 

44
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,580
first example happens again , namely 

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,720
the whole ending is 

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,620
knocked out before the following vowel. 

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,520
All that remains is the 

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
initial vowel of the first word. 

49
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,900
I have 

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,600
brought you two small examples here. For 
example, if 

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,500
the word me and unum were to collide 

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,140
, then the following would happen: the E 
is 

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,020
dropped and what remains is munum 

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,160
and you would read it like this, 

55
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,380
munum, the E has really 

56
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,060
disappeared, 

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
been knocked out , elysion. Another 

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,090
example, unum adque, here too 

59
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,950
, as with the second 

60
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,810
example, we now have a word that 

61
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,190
ends vowel , this time with a vowel plus 
M, and 

62
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,550
the following word that 

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,690
begins with a vowel . So here, too, we 

64
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,090
simply knock out the ending. 

65
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,030
What remains is un- and we would read and 

66
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,350
also measure unatque when scansion. 

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,660
A special form of elision 

68
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,820
takes place when a 

69
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,980
word with a vowel ending is followed by 
either 

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,980
the form es from esse, du bist, or 

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,200
est, er, sie, es ist. 

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,380
We then use a process 

73
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,520
called departure. This is basically 

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,980
a reverse illusion. 

75
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,200
Again, I've 

76
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,480
used this little picture as an example 

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,400
. So here we have 

78
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,480
our vowel sound and it 

79
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,360
is followed by the word es or est. In 

80
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,440
these cases, you see, this time 

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,140
the vowel of the first word is 

82
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,700
retained, but this time 

83
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,100
the e of es or est disappears . 

84
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,720
We have an example here, Bono est, if 

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,160
you chant it , would 

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,720
become Bonost in a verse after we 

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,650
have knocked out the E. An 

88
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,230
apheresis also takes place when you 

89
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,730
have a word, like here, that 

90
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,170
ends in a vowel plus M. 

91
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,310
Again, this time the E would disappear. 

92
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,530
What remains is a vowel Mst. An 

93
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,710
example. Bonum est. You would have to 

94
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,650

95
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,150
treat this in a verse Das as follows. You 
see, you have it, 

96
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,130
before the vowel ending um, so 

97
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,230
we knock out the e. 

98
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,070
What remains is bonumst. Another 

99
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,770
phenomenon to be aware of is 

100
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,990
the so-called iamb shortening. 

101
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,850
There are certain words that 

102
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,270
actually have an iambic 

103
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,690
round structure by nature, i.e. they 
consist of 

104
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,390
a length followed by a, 

105
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,350
sorry, they consist of 

106
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,010
a shortness followed by a 

107
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,430
length. Examples would be the 

108
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,310
word nihil, nichts, mihi, mir, 

109
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,380
tibi, dir and the first person 

110
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,180
singular indicative present active of 

111
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,120
rogare, rogo, ich bitte, ich frage. 

112
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,120
And we can 

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,780
actually measure these words as double 
abbreviations. 

114
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,160
That's why we're talking about 

115
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,620
jam shortenings. In other words, the 

116
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,860
words that I have already 

117
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,540
marked for you above could also be 

118
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,320
measured as nihil, 

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,160
mihi, tibi and orogo. 

120
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,210
Now that you' 

121
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,750
ve learned about elysion, 

122
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,890
apharesis and jam shortening 

123
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,530
, let's look at two 

124
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,290
more important points. 

125
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,900
Firstly, the consonant H. In fact 

126
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,620
, you should never 

127
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,820
count an H when scansion. Never. 

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,400
This is because 

129
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Latin did not regard the H as a real 

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,740
full letter 

131
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,160
, but as spiritus, translated 

132
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,700
as breath. And indeed, the H 

133
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,940
also fell silent very early on in 

134
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
spoken Latin. And you could 

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,700
also remember clumsily that what you don't 

136
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,500
speak, you don't measure. And 

137
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
finally, it's about the 

138
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,940
combination of muta cum liquida. 

139
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,000
What is mute, what is liquida? I 

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
have written down here 

141
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,740
which consonants 

142
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:19,120
belong to the so-called muta, K, G, T, D, 

143
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,640
P and B. And if these 

144
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,060
consonants are followed by a liquida, 

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,420
the liquidae include R and L, then 

146
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,700
this combination can, as it 

147
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,840
should, 

148
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,140
have a position-length-forming effect, 

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,600
but the syllable before it, if it 

150
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,360
is short , can also be measured short. 

151
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,920
Let's take a look at two small 

152
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,980
examples. If we look at 

153
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,340
the accusative partem of partis, 

154
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,280
partly, you can see that we have 

155
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,720
two consonants R and T after the a. So 

156
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,300
the A must be measured long, because we 

157
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,020
have a position length. I 

158
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,460
also have a liquida and a 

159
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,420
muta here , but in the order liquida 

160
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,020
- muta. This always 

161
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,760
forms the position length. In contrast 

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,120
to the accusative patras, where I have 

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,860
two options. 

164
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,960
Again, I have two consonants and 

165
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,400
of course I can 

166
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,600
measure this A as position length. 

167
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,540
But now I also have the option 

168
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,680
, because this time it really is 

169
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,040
the combination of muta with liquida 

170
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,920
, to measure the A short, as 

171
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,740
here, patrim. That's 

172
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,760
a whole series of special features 

173
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,500
to consider, but you'll 

174
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,760

175
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,420
soon get the hang of it through practice. 
In the next video, 

176
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,800
however, I'll show you 

177
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,980
an example of this again. So, 

178
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,580
bye!
