00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,170
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,570
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,030
In this video, you will learn all about 

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,090
internet research and how to 

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,790

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,390
find more information for your 
presentation . Today we'll be looking at 

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,210
the following points. 

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,810
Gaining an overview of the topic, 

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,690
researching the internet in more detail, 

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,010
evaluating sources correctly and 

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,770
citing internet sources. 

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,310
So let's start with how to 

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,870
... get an overview of the 

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,630
topic. 

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,460
A good way to get an 

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,980
overview 

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,500
of a specific topic on the Internet 

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,860
is to use the free encyclopaedia 
Wikipedia. 

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,540
You can find it at en.wikipedia 

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,520
.org. 

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,460
For example, if you 

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,840
have to give a presentation on the topic 
of honey, you can 

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
enter the term honey in 

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,040
the search field on Wikipedia. 

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,220
An article on the 

26
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,720
topic of honey will then appear. At the 
top you will find 

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,820
a definition that explains the term 

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,860
honey. Below this you will find 

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,840
a table of contents. The 

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,820
sub-items in the 

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,820
table of contents already give you 

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,480
a good overview of the topic. 

33
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,280
Let's delve deeper into the subject 

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,140
and take a 

35
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,760
closer look at the research point. 

36
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,230
In the Wikipedia table of contents, 

37
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,730
you will always find the 

38
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,970
underlying literature, the 

39
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,650
web links and individual references at the 
very end. 

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,830
The Wikipedia web links will take you 

41
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,670
to helpful pages. 

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,710
In the case of honey, for example, this 
could 

43
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,150
be the page beinfo.de. 

44
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,230
On most pages there is 

45
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,010
a point on the left that 

46
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,730
can lead you to other interesting pages. 

47
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,870
Now a few tips on 

48
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,570
keyword searches with the search engine. 

49
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,550
Use exact terms. Terms. 

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,150
Combine different terms that 

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,670
describe what you 

52
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,230
are looking for as precisely as possible. 
When searching for the 

53
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,370
function of drones in the bee colony 

54
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,230
, do not search for biology bees 

55
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,570
, but for bee drone function. 

56
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,190
Pay attention to the order of your 

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,450
search terms. Write them in 

58
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,370
order of importance. Lower 

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,890
and upper case letters of the search terms 

60
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,490
are irrelevant. 

61
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,370
Also pay attention to grammar 

62
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,630
so as not to limit your search results 
unnecessarily 

63
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,010
. For verbs, 

64
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,310
only use the stem of the word, e.g. 

65
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,890
sammel instead of sammeln and no 

66
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,030
tense, i.e. not sammelten. 

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,080
Use the singular for nouns. 

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
You can exclude certain words from your 

69
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,200
search by 

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,440
placing a minus sign in front of them. A 
search for 

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,740
bee, drone function minus honey 

72
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,480
will find all pages containing the 

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,380
first three terms and 

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,300
not the word honey. You 

75
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,850
can also narrow down your 

76
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,190
search on Google. You can do this 

77
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,450
by changing the search options. 

78
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,250
You 

79
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,840
can also 

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,960
search for images on Google. To do this, 
go to the Google website 

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,760
and enter your search term. 

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,480
Then click on the sub-item 

83
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,900
Images. 

84
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,630
Then select an image by 

85
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,310
clicking on it. You will be taken to a 

86
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,050
website where the image 

87
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,830
was found. 

88
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,490
On the right-hand side of the screen, you 
will 

89
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,110
see a pop-up from Google for this 

90
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,450
image. Click on Original size. 

91
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,110
On the following page you will only see 

92
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,770
the image in its original size. 

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,570
You can 

94
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,410
save or copy the image by right-clicking 
on it. 

95
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,540

96
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,800
You now know how to find information on 
the Internet. All that remains is to 
evaluate these 

97
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,240
sources correctly. 

98
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,040

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,740
You should therefore always critically 

100
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,140
scrutinize Wikipedia and other forum posts 
. The articles in the 

101
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,200
online encyclopedia Wikipedia are 

102
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,860
mainly 

103
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,820
written and checked by private 
individuals. You should 

104
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,240
therefore 

105
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,320
not 

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,740

107
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,600
rely solely on information from Wikipedia 
for your research. If you find 

108
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,640
an interesting video in a forum, you 
should 

109
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,200

110
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,560
be even more careful than with 

111
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,160
articles on Wikipedia, as 

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,700
no one usually checks their 

113
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,160
accuracy afterwards . Check the 

114
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,220
information from Wikipedia or 

115
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,420
forums by 

116
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,540

117
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,340
comparing it with other sources such as 
books, magazines and websites. 

118
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,990
Now let's move on to the topic of how 

119
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,530
to select relevant websites 

120
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,050
. For example, if you 

121
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,090

122
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,410
click on bee links on the b-info.de 
website , you will find the following web 
links. 

123
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,290
Always remember that websites 

124
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,170
from official bodies, 

125
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,270
such as universities, offices 

126
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,530
or institutions, are always 

127
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,050
more reliable than private sites where 

128
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,010
the operator may be unclear 

129
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,230
. 

130
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,770
The question arises as to how to 

131
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,170
reliably 

132
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,000
check internet sources. First of all, we 
should 

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,680
ask ourselves who 

134
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,240
actually operates the website 

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,480
and with what aim? Look for a 

136
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,440
menu item that tells you this 

137
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,320
. You will often find something like 

138
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,320
about this site, about us, who we 

139
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,020
are or similar sub-items. Every 

140
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,860
website must contain 

141
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,860
a link to the so-called imprint on the 
main page 

142
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,480
. The official 

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,960
operator of the site is named there. 

144
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,650
You should also ask yourself whether there 
are 

145
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,610
references or references on 

146
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,890
the page and on what 

147
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,870
basis an article was written. 

148
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,570
Pay attention to footnotes, sources 

149
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,570
or references at the end of the 

150
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,990
article or embedded links 

151
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,790
in the article. 

152
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,070
When citing online sources, there 

153
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,870
are a few special features to bear in 
mind. 

154
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,740
First of all, find out who the 

155
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,460
authors of the page you have accessed are 

156
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,260
and when the article 

157
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,960
was written. 

158
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800

159
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,060
Is there any indication of this at the 
beginning or end of the page or is there 
something in the 

160
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,520
title bar of your browser? 

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,380
In some browsers, you can also 

162
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,760
right-click anywhere 

163
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,740
on the page and select 

164
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,940
Show page information. 

165
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,640
You will then find a lot of 

166
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,080
technical information, but often 

167
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,660
also the author and the date 

168
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,500
the page was created. If 

169
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,380
you 

170
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,440
have not found any information about the 
car , use the operator of the page 

171
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,660
from the legal notice. Write down or 

172
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,860
copy the exact URL of the page 

173
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,040
you want to cite. 

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,260
Also make a note of when you visited the 
page 

175
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,360
. Preferably with the time. 

176
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,410
Once you have all the information 
together, 

177
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,430

178
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,570
write down the result as follows. Make 
sure 

179
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,030
that the citation is written in italics . 

180
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,620
An example like this will make this even 
clearer 

181
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,300
. 

182
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,140
Incidentally, the date and time are 

183
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,160
important because a 

184
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,980
website 

185
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,280
can of course change constantly. 

186
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,770
