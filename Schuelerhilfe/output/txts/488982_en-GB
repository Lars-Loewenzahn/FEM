with the 

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,560
translation just like. I 

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,630
have 

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,270
brought you an example sentence. 

33
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,350
Many people say something different from 

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,970
what they think. 

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,800
After the word idem 

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,740

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,400
, there can also be a relative pronoun in 
CMM congruence with the meaning wie. A 

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,640
relative pronoun could be qui, qui or 

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,380
quod. In the example sentence idem 

40
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,460
sentio adque tu or idem ego sentio 

41
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,480
quod tu, you can see the 

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,580
relative pronoun. With the translation 

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,520
I feel the same as you. Here 

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,620
you have the translation wie. You 

45
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,930
should note that a 

46
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,450
negated alius connects with nisi 

47
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,830
. Nemo alius nisi. Here 

48
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,290
you can see the connection. 

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,560
None other than. Nihil aliot nisi? 

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
Nothing other than. Quit aliot nisi? 

51
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,800
What else but? Let me 

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,460
summarize once again. This 

53
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,740
learning video was about the word adquo. 

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,380
Adquo can also 

55
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,380
be abbreviated to ag. The basic meaning of 
adquo 

56
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,040
is and and refers to 

57
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,540
things that belong together . As a 

58
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,660
special feature, adquo can also be 

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,020
translated as wie and denotes 

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,220
a comparative particle. 

61
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you for your attention and see you 

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,560
next time.
