00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,020
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,940
a learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,840
Today I'm going to explain the NCI. NCI 

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,200
is the abbreviation for Nominativos com 

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,340
Infinitivo. 

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,180
This name may 

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,580
sound strange at first. But 

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,340
if we translate this sentence into Latin, 

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,240
we get an NCI straight away. The sentence 

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,580
would read Nomen primo alienum esse 

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,240
videtur. An NCI 

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,160
is made up of a subject, here Nomen, as 

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,160
in ACI, an infinitive, here 

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,030
Esse, and a predicate. The predicate 

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,450
is in the passive voice here. An NCI 

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,130
is therefore basically 

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,570
just an 

18
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,410
ACI in the passive voice. The only 
difference is 

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,470
that we don't know who 

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,390
hears, says, sees or anything else. 

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,650
There is one thing you need to bear in 
mind. 

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,530
Not all verbs 

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,310
that can have an ACI can also have an NCI 

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,810
. We then have to ask ourselves, 

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,610
which verbs have an NCI? 

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,400
Let's take a look at that. First of all, 

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,540
there are verbs of command and 

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,290
prohibition. The person 

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,250
speaking a prohibition is not 

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,870
named or should not 

31
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,950
be named or sometimes may 

32
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,430
not be named. An example 

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,310
of this is Milites pugnare 

34
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,410
juventur. First of all, we see that we 

35
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,350
have a subject again at the beginning. 

36
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,190
Then we have the infinitive and at the 

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,890
end juventur, a predicate in the 

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,370
passive voice. Juubere means to command. 

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,270
So we have a verb of command. 

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,730
And we translate, one commands the 

41
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,110
soldiers to fight. 

42
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,600
Then there is a nci next to the verb 

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,740
videre when it is in the passive voice. It 

44
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,080
then means to shine. 

45
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,590
Let's take a look at another example 

46
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,190
. Mons altissimus esse videtur. We 

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,630
see that we again have a subject 

48
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,870
in the nominative case, an infinitive and, 
at the 

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,010
end, our predicate in the passive voice. 
And 

50
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,550
we first translate literally, it 

51
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,710
seems that the mountain is very high. 

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,970
We now also have other 

53
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,950
ways of expressing this. 

54
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,430
Another possible translation is 

55
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,510
, the mountain seems to 

56
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,490
be high. Or the last possibility, 

57
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,790
apparently the mountain is high. 

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,200
Finally, the NCEI is also found in 

59
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,700
verbs of saying and verbs of 

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,960
thinking. as well as audiere or dickere. 

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
In German, we cannot express this 

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,540
literally. So we have to 

63
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,940
come up with alternative formulations 

64
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,660
. 

65
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's take another look at what this means 
using an 

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,240
example. Markus, Piga, Esse, 

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,460
Dickitur. Again, we have a 

68
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,280
subject, Markus, in the nominative case. 
Then 

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,980
we have an infinitive, Esse, and at the 

70
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,640
end of the sentence a predicate in the 

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
passive voice. Let's try 

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,440
the literal 

73
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,960
version first . This reads, Markus is 

74
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,160
said to be lazy. That 

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,580
doesn't sound nice. We can therefore 
replace it 

76
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,680
with other formulations. 

77
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,020
One idea would be, Mark is said to be 

78
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,640
lazy. That sounds 

79
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,480
better. You could also say that 

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,020
Mark is said to be lazy. Another 

81
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,640
idea would be to say that Mark is lazy or 

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,180
, finally, that Mark is supposedly lazy 

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,960
or that Mark is said to be lazy. 

84
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,660
Here you can see some more verbs 

85
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,960
with NCI. For example, 

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,020
dikor, one says that I, then 

87
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,720
nuntior would be an introduction for an 

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,860
NCI, one reports that. Then there is 

89
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,960
putor or credor, 

90
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,600
which both mean you believe. And finally 
vertor 

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,460
or veruntor, one reports. Or 

92
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,620
traditur, traduntur, one transmits. 

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,160
You have to be careful, the last 

94
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,040
two verbs only 

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,300
occur in the third person. And that brings 
us 

96
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,440
to the summary 

97
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,140
. You have seen what 

98
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,640
an NCI is made up of. Nomen 

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,220
primo alienum esse videtur. You have 

100
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,780
a subject, you have an infinitive 

101
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,320
and a predicate in the passive voice. The 
NCI 

102
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,720
is also used with verbs of commanding 

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,270
and forbidding, behind video, in the 

104
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,770
sense of seeming in the passive voice and 

105
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,370
finally with verbs of saying and 

106
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,490
thinking. Thank you for your 

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,230
attention and see you next 

108
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,590
time.
