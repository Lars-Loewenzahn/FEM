00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,440
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,260
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,520
This video is about 

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,240
dictionaries. A dictionary can 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,480
also be called a reference book. 

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,480
This can either be online in a 

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,800
search engine or an actual 

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,420
book for reference. What both 

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,220
have in common is that it is always an 

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,740
alphabetically sorted list of 

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,340
words to which certain 

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,260
information is assigned. 

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,380
Let's start with the 

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,520
structure of the dictionary. 

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,400
Dictionary. Depending on what kind of 

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,080
dictionary you use, it is structured a 

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,580
little differently. What they all have in 
common is 

18
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,900
that they usually 

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,160
have user instructions that explain 

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,000
how best to 

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,100
use the dictionary . There is also a 

22
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,380
list of abbreviations with all the 

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,120
abbreviations 

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,900
used in the book. This is followed by 

25
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,520
the dictionary with all the 

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,320
words that are listed and 

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,700
there is usually also 

28
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,780
an appendix at the back , for example with 

29
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,380
irregular verbs or 

30
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,230
the like. 

31
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,490
Next , let's take a look at the different 
types of 

32
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,990
dictionaries. First of all, 

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,410
there are language dictionaries. These 

34
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,930
either represent the entire 

35
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,750
vocabulary of a language or the 

36
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,550
partial vocabulary of a language. 

37
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,810
Partial vocabulary means 

38
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,490
, for example, that there are dictionaries 
only about 

39
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,830
certain dialects or about 

40
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,590
colloquial language. What they all have in 
common is 

41
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,530
that they provide linguistic information 

42
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,110
, i.e. how it is 

43
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,550
written, how it is pronounced, its 

44
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,570
origin, meaning and 

45
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,430
grammatical characteristics. There may 

46
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,610
also be an 

47
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,870
assignment of comparable words 

48
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,690
, for example synonyms or 

49
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,950
rhymes. Sometimes there are 

50
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,750
special dictionaries for this. These are 
then called 

51
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,130
synonym dictionaries or rhyming 

52
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,990
dictionaries. Synonyms are words 

53
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,250
with very similar or very identical 

54
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,610
meanings 

55
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,830
that can be used in a similar way and 

56
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,710
do not differ greatly in their meaning. 

57
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,510
The next type of dictionary 

58
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,270
is the foreign dictionary. These 

59
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,310
list all the words from 

60
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,030
foreign language components that 

61
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,010

62
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,170
are used in the German language. These are 
frequently 

63
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,390
used phrases and 

64
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,430
idioms. And 

65
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,130
foreign language elements are then 

66
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,590
explained in more detail , for example 

67
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,090
the meaning, where it 

68
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,330
comes from, how it is pronounced and 

69
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,070
how it is written. Another type of 

70
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,830
dictionary 

71
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,530
is the lexicon or subject dictionary, 

72
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,110
encyclopaedia or specialist lexicon if 

73
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,510
it only 

74
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,050
relates to a specific subject area. Here, 
more 

75
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,970
world and factual knowledge is conveyed 

76
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,470
instead of linguistic knowledge, which is 
why 

77
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,970
it is also said to 

78
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,690
contain factual information. 

79
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,390
However, in some cases this can also 

80
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,930
be mixed with linguistic knowledge. 

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
Now we come to important questions. 

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Firstly, why do I need a 

83
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,720
dictionary? With the help of a 

84
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,140
dictionary, you can 

85
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,980

86
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,580
look up the pronunciation and spelling of 
words and also what the words 

87
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,860
mean. Then you can also 

88
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,720
look up what certain 

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,520
idioms there are with this word 

90
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
and what examples of 

91
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,140
usage there are, i.e. in which 

92
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,420
situations the word is used. 

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,660
It is also very important that you 

94
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,700

95
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,440
can use this to expand your vocabulary so 
that you 

96
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,070
don't repeat yourself so often in your 
texts. Then 

97
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,450
there's the important question of how do I 
use 

98
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,970
my dictionary? The aim is 

99
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,270
, of course, to 

100
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,290

101
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,210
be able to look up the information you are 
looking for quickly and specifically so 

102
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,350
that you can find it as quickly as 
possible. 

103
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,010
The following tips will help you do this. 
The whole thing 

104
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,710
is always sorted alphabetically. 

105
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,130
This means that if you are 

106
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,310
looking for a specific word , you have to 

107
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,130
narrow it down further and further. For 
example, if you 

108
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,910
are looking for cat, you first look 

109
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,110
up K, then go to K-A 

110
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,230
and so on and so forth, so keep 

111
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,750
narrowing it down according to the 

112
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,810
different letters. It is important that 

113
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,870

114
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,930

115
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,330
you pay attention to keywords and key 
words. These are 

116
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,310
printed in bold at the top and help you to 

117
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,770
find a word more quickly. Please 

118
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,510
also note that not all 

119
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,030
word forms are shown in the dictionary. 

120
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,910
For example, verbs are always in the 

121
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,390
infinitive and compound words 

122
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,850
are sometimes not included. 

123
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,270
You have to 

124
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,570
look at the individual components. 

125
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,130
Finally, let's look at 

126
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,370
some frequently used 

127
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,630
abbreviations 

128
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,150
that are helpful to know. For example, 
here for 

129
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,190
special, abbreviation 

130
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,430
, colloquial, original and 

131
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,670
comparisons. These abbreviations 

132
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,010
are also listed in 

133
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,430
the dictionary's list of abbreviations 

134
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,170
. 

135
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,640
It is also very helpful to 

136
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,200
know the special symbols 

137
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,120
used in a dictionary. For example, 

138
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
there is the underscored 

139
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,360
dot, as here in Abiturient. This tells 

140
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
us that the whole thing 

141
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,640
is emphasized briefly . Or the underscore 

142
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,420
, Abitur, which is then 

143
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,680
emphasized for a long time. 

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,500
You will always find the pronunciation in 
square brackets , sometimes 

145
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,980
also in phonetic transcription. Then a 

146
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,020
vertical line shows you the 

147
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,860
hyphenation within a word 

148
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,260
. An equals sign 

149
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,100
always refers to a 

150
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,800
word with the same meaning , i.e. a 
synonym. And an 

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,080
arrow indicates a reference within the 

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,400
dictionary. To 

153
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,880
summarize the whole thing once again, 

154
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,900
this video was about working 

155
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,700
with a dictionary. 

156
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,620
There are different types of dictionaries 

157
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,520
, but they are always 

158
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,800
sorted alphabetically so that you can find 
the 

159
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,640
information quickly. 

160
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,700
It is important that you 

161
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,740

162
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,340

163
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,580
look at the list of abbreviations and user 
notes for each dictionary . 

164
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,420
Thank you for your 

165
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,540
attention. See 

166
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,080
you next time.
