00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,430
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,890
Schülerhilfe learning videos. In this 
module, 

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,670
we will look at how to 

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,770
work with information and create a 

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,410
scientific text. 

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,910
We will deal with the following 

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,490
points. Language, form and 

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,190
structure of a scientific 

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,170
text. The page layout. The 

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,790
citation style and citation forms. 

11
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,490
Sources and footnotes. 

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,890
Let's get started. How do I write a 

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,870
scientific text? 

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,140
Writing scientifically 

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,200
means writing factually. No feelings, 

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,440
opinions or evaluations. No 

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,160
inner actions, i.e. thoughts 

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,660
or monologues. Use of 

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,460
indirect rather than literal speech. 

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,340
A concise but precise description 

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,320
of things. An objective point of view. 

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,840
Therefore, you should not 

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,360
use the first person. 

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,300
Example Suddenly there was a 

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,960
loud clatter . Lauri was startled and saw 

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,480
a 

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,320
shadow moving slowly towards her in the 
darkness of the living room 

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,540
. This sentence belongs in a 

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,160
narrative. 

30
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,230
If you want to give a factual account of 
this event 

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,210
, it should read something like 

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,490
After Lauri heard 

33
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,850
the burglar break the window, 

34
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,630
she saw him enter the 

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,610
apartment through the living room. 

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,670
Form and structure The 

37
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,000

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,020
structure of longer academic papers is as 
follows. The 

39
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,980
cover page first contains the topic, first 

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,640
 and last name of the author, the 

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,860
date of submission and other information. 
This is followed by 

42
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,360
the obligatory 

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,620
table of contents. This is usually 
followed by 

44
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,340
further lists such as 

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,300

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,920
lists of abbreviations, figures or tables. 
Next 

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,700
comes the text, i.e. the 

48
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,040
main part of the academic 

49
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,940
paper. This is followed by the 

50
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,600
appendix, the bibliography with 

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,000
all references and a 

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,900
declaration in lieu of an oath that the 

53
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,760
work was written independently. 

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,980
In academic texts, there are 

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,780
generally three sections: 

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,860
introduction, main body and conclusion 
with 

57
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,490
references. In the 

58
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,350
introduction, the approach to 

59
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,770
the work and the 

60
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,150
problem are explained. The 

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,530
main part deals with the 

62
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,750
presentation of various points. In the 

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,110
conclusion, 

64
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,970
a summary is used to 

65
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,290

66
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,090
draw a mental arc to the problem. There is 
also space here 

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,270
for an outlook or a 

68
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,440
reflection. Let's take a look at some 

69
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,390
tips on page layout. For the 

70
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,790
margins, 

71
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,990

72
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,710
leave 3 cm at the top and bottom , 4 cm on 
the left and 2 cm on the right. Choose a 
common 

73
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,930
font, such as Times 

74
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,770
New Roman or Arial. Choose 

75
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,650
font size 12, although the 

76
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,430
headings 

77
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,590
can of course be larger. Format the text 
in 

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,130
justified text and use 

79
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,630
automatic hyphenation. Choose 1 

80
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,190
.5 line spacing. All pages 

81
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,370
should be numbered, except for the 

82
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,890
cover page. 

83
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,450
The cover page should be numbered from 
page 1. 

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,960
For longer academic 

85
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,500
papers, the cover page should be 

86
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,640
numbered without page numbering. The table 
of contents, 

87
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,120

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,400
list of abbreviations, list of figures, 
appendix and bibliography are numbered 
using 

89
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
Roman numerals. The 

90
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,320
text and the appendix are 

91
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,780
numbered with Arabic numerals. 

92
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,540
Citation and citation forms All 

93
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,810
thoughts by or references to 

94
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,130
other authors must 

95
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,390
be identified, i.e. cited. 

96
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,870
This serves the verifiability of the 

97
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,230
statements made in the text. The 

98
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,550
principles of citation 

99
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,610
Directness Quotations should always 

100
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,310

101
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,450
be based on the originality of the 
statements. Be taken from. 

102
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,550
Appropriateness. Quotations should only 

103
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,290
contain what the author 

104
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,250
wishes to substantiate. Accuracy. 

105
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,190
References should be sufficient 

106
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,050
and clearly identified 

107
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,270
. 

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,460
A bibliography at the end of the 

109
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,960
text is obligatory. Short references 

110
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,680
in the text or in a footnote should 

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,540
be written in font size 10 and 

112
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,960
should include the author's name, the 

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,940
year of publication and the page number 

114
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,360
. Each short reference must 

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,260

116
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,680
appear as a full reference in the 
bibliography . The references belong 
directly 

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,260
after the citation or at the end of the 

118
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,520
sentence. And the first time 

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,020
a source is cited , the complete 

120
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,940
source information must be given. 

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,940
The 

122
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,290
abbreviated reference may only be used for 
subsequent citations . In a 

123
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,070
literal or direct quotation 

124
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,610
, sentences, parts of sentences, terms 

125
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,050
or definitions are taken over in their 
wording 

126
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,230
. It must 

127
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,950
be placed in quotation marks. And 

128
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,390
it must 

129
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,790
correspond to the original text. Omissions 
from quotations 

130
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,490

131
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,510
are indicated by square brackets and three 
dots. 

132
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,250
Breaks in quotations are indicated by 
three 

133
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,830
dots. Quotation extensions can be placed 
in 

134
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,090
brackets and marked with an 

135
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,910
author's note. 

136
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,710

137
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,750
Single quotation marks are used for 
quotation within quotations 

138
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,330
. 

139
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,320
An indirect quotation 

140
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,800
is an adoption of ideas or 

141
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,500
a reference to other authors. It is 

142
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,580
indicated by the addition of comparisons 

143
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,500
. 

144
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,960
Care must be taken to ensure that the 
scope of the 

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,060
analogous adoption is clear. 

146
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,450
References The bibliography 

147
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,370
is a 

148
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,350
list of all 

149
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,070
sources cited in the text. It is 
irrelevant whether the 

150
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,950
sources 

151
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,450
were cited directly or indirectly. The 
bibliography 

152
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,930
belongs at the end of 

153
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,510
the text or paper. 

154
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,590
They are sorted alphabetically according 

155
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,030
to the author's surname. If you 

156
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,670

157
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,490
use sources without constitutional 
references , use the abbreviation O. 

158
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,790
For internet sources, first state 

159
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,550
the 

160
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,930
author 's surname and first name or the 
publishing 

161
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,190
organization. A colon 

162
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,570
is followed by the title and the 

163
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,570
subtitle, including the spelling. 

164
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,950
This is followed by the year of 
publication 

165
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,750
and the address of the website, 

166
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,070
i.e. the URL. Finally 

167
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,750
, it is important to 

168
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,370
state the date of publication. If no 
author 

169
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,550
can be specified , use the address of the 

170
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,950
website and the query date, as shown 

171
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,790
in this example. 

172
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,510
A monograph, i.e. a 

173
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,250
scientific treatise, 

174
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,910
is cited as follows. Author's surname and

Journals are 

180
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,470
cited slightly differently. Author's name 
and 

181
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,850
first name, colon, title of the 

182
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,150

They begin with a capital letter and end 

195
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,210

203
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,450
