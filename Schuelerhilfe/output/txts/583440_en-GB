00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,880
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,380
In this video, you will learn more about 

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,580
the functions of the Impress program and 

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,640
the media design of 

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,780
presentations. 

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,560
In Module 2, you have already 

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,620

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,660
learned about the basic functions of 
Impress. Today you will learn 

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,080
about changing the font, 

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,120
inserting images, placing 

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,720
text and images, the 

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,880
color design of presentations, 

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,620
presentations and inserting 

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,900
animations. 

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,140
You have already learned how to change the 
size and 

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,340
type of font in the Format sub-item 

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,140
. 

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,100
However, there are many other 

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,380
change functions in Impress . For example 

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,260
, you can change the alignment of the text 

22
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,940

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,380
by clicking on Align in the Format 
sub-item . You then have 

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,300
the choice between left-aligned, 

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,920
centered, right-aligned or 

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,480
justified. 

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,780
If you 

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,000
click on Format in the ribbon and then on 
Character, you can 

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,300
set the text to bold, italic or 

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
underline. Under 

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,500
Font effects, you can change the color 

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,020
of the font. You will also 

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,120
find further settings here. 

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,660
For example, you can give the text a 

35
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,740
shadow or 

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,800
cross out individual words. 

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,460
Now we know how to change the 

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,480
font. Let's move on to 

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
the next point, inserting 

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,620
shapes. You can insert 

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,400
various shapes into your presentation 

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,800
, such as rectangles, 

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,800
lines, 

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,440
arrows of different shapes , ellipses, 
brackets and many, 

45
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,020
many more. You can also change the 

46
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,060
color of the outline and fill 

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,340
as well as the thickness of the outline 

48
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,560
. 

49
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,210
If you 

50
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,610
want to insert a shape into your 
presentation, 

51
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,390
look for the 

52
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,410
Insert item in the ribbon and click on the 

53
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,570
Shape sub-item. 

54
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,670
Here you can choose between lines, 

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,570
standard shapes and symbols 

56
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,490
. Under standard shapes, for 

57
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,210
example, you will find circles, 

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,950
rectangles and triangles. 

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,060
Then click on the point in the 

60
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
slide where you 

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,400
want to insert the shape 

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,780
and hold down the mouse button. 

63
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,420
You can 

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,600
set the size of the shape by dragging the 
mouse. When the shape is the right 

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,720
size, 

66
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:55,940
release the mouse button. 

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,420
If you click on the shape with the right 

68
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,360
mouse button, a 

69
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,280
submenu will open . Under Line and area, 

70
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,900
you can 

71
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,000
change the outline and fill of the shape. 
You will also 

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,620
find further 

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,740
setting options here. 

74
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,920
For example, you can automatically 

75
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
align the shape on the slide or 

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,240
change the arrangement of the shapes. 

77
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,090
Inserting images works in 

78
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,610
the same way. Click on the 

79
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,430
Image sub-item under Insert. You can now 

80
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,690

81
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,430

82
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,730
directly insert images that you have saved 
on your computer or USB stick. 

83
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,170
If you click on your image with the right 

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,170
mouse button, you can 

85
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,190
edit it. 

86
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,150
The typical submenu will then open again. 

87
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,330
For example, you can replace the image 
here 

88
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,770
, 

89
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,230
crop the image or 

90
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,090
change the position and size. 

91
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,710
Now let's move on to the visual 

92
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,490
design . The most important thing is that 

93
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,030
less is more. Because too much is 

94
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,650
often confusing, too much overwhelms 

95
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,970
the audience and 

96
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,360
also distracts them unnecessarily. Hence 
three 

97
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,020
rules. Don't put too many pictures 

98
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,360
on one slide. One or two 

99
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,480
meaningful pictures or diagrams 

100
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,420
are usually enough. 

101
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,860
Only write the most important points on 
the 

102
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,780
slide and explain other aspects 

103
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,620
verbally. Also, use 

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,720
bullet points instead of formulated 

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
sentences. 

106
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Let's take a look at a negative example. 

107
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,920
This slide contains too much text. 

108
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,380
There is also too much information 

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,220
on the slide. 

110
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,940
It would be better to 

111
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,200
divide the information into two slides. 
The diagrams 

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,260
shown here are unfortunately 

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,060
too small to 

114
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,520
be read properly. One diagram would 

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
certainly have sufficed here. 

116
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,980
This slide is better. The diagram 

117
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,740
is large enough to 

118
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,180
read. 

119
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,020

120
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,280
There would also have been room for a few 
key points on this slide. 

121
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,710

122
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,590
There is one thing to say about the color 
scheme. Just not too much. 

123
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,470
Generally use colors sparingly and 

124
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,770
consciously. Use colors to highlight the 

125
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,930
most important things. 

126
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,850
Only use font colors that 

127
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,610
are clearly visible on the background, for 

128
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,190
example, not 

129
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,570
light yellow on white or dark gray on 

130
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,370
black in the background. Too many 

131
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,570
colors make your slide 

132
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,270
confusing and 

133
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,410
unnecessarily distract the listener from 
what is being said. 

134
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,040
Let's take a look at a 

135
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,300
negative example. This slide 

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,260
contains far too many font colors. 

137
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,940
The yellow font on a white 

138
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,700
background is difficult to read. 

139
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,560
There are also too many confusing 

140
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,500
colored rectangles. 

141
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,820
This 

142
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
slide would be a positive example. It 
looks very tidy and 

143
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,620
colors are only 

144
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,880
used selectively for support. 

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,320
Now let's 

146
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
think about the background of the slides. 

147
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,840
You can 

148
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,060
change the background of your slide by 
clicking on Slide 

149
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,760
properties or 

150
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,540
Set background under Slide. 

151
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,120
As a general rule, only use 

152
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,060
colored backgrounds in exceptional cases, 

153
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,220
as they can be distracting and bright 

154
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,380
or even neon-colored backgrounds 

155
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,900
overwhelm the eye. 

156
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,140
Instead, use neutral to 

157
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,740
pastel-colored backgrounds 

158
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,580
that are not distracting. 

159
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,220
The same applies to the layout in general. 
Here 

160
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,040
you can see a negative example. The 

161
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,860
bright blue background is 

162
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,100
tiring for the eye in the long run. 

163
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,380
A neutral 

164
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,180
background or a pastel-colored 

165
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,600
background , for example, is better. You 

166
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,380
can 

167
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,520

168
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,920
group several fields, for example texts, 
shapes or images, so that they form a 

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,380
single field. To do this, click 

170
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,240
on the desired fields one after the other 

171
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,200
while 

172
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,000
holding down the control key. 

173
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,580
Then click on the right mouse button 

174
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,580
and click on Group. The 

175
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,840
different fields are now 

176
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,700
connected. 

177
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,870
With Impress, you can also 

178
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,050
add so-called animations. You can use them 
to 

179
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,070

180
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,770
make text fields, shapes or images appear, 

181
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,170
disappear or change when you move on. 

182
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,960
To insert an animation, click on 

183
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,460
your field, i.e. your image, text 

184
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,680
or shape, and 

185
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
then click on 

186
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,640
Custom animations under Slide. 

187
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,160
Then select an animation and click 

188
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,040
on the green plus on the right-hand 

189
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,240
side. You 

190
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,960
can of course also 

191
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,960
insert several animations. To do this, 

192
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,800
click on the next field and then again on 

193
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,360
the green plus on the right-hand side 

194
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,120
and select the desired animation 

195
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,680
. 

196
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,570
You can 

197
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,710
also change the order of the animations 
here by 

198
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,810
first selecting an animation at the top 

199
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,590
and then 

200
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,680
clicking on one of the arrows at the 
bottom. The best way to do this is to use 
the 

201
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
group function. Here 

202
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,350
you can see an 

203
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,470
example of what your screen 

204
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,950
looks like if you 

205
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,510
have grouped several fields and 

206
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,770
added an animation to this grouping . 

207
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
You already know Impress 

208
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,640
pretty well. In module 4, you will learn 

209
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,280
how to create a handout. 

210
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,080
Thank you for your attention 

211
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,980
and I wish you every success in 

212
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,440
creating your presentation.
