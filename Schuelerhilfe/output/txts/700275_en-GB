1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,210
How pleasant and easy it would be if 

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,210
we 

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,210
could move participants from the course 
schedule , 

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,030
not just within a day, 

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,290
but also 

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,410
make changes to subjects over the course 
of a day, 

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,050
and all this 

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,790
taking into account the course load 

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,610
or the 

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,010
course composition. We would have 

11
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,090
a lot of winners. 

12
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,430
On the one hand, we have the students as 

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,310
winners, who 

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,190
have the right course for them. But we 
also have the teachers 

15
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,550
as winners because they 

16
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,910
also 

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,230
have a suitable course. And last but not 
least, we 

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,470
as student support managers have of course 

19
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,790
also 

20
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,670
gained a great deal by saving time and 

21
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,890

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,970
being able to show the results in just a 
few clicks . 

23
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,290
You can do all this with this little 
function, which 

24
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,910
is shown here far too small, 

25
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,170
move mode. When I 

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,810
activate this function, 

27
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,550
these two arrows move through and 

28
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,750
these three small dots 

29
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,630
now become targets. 

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,530
Pay attention. Crossed out, here we 

31
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,750
have the targets. I have 

32
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,830

33
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,230
already 

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,130
made a restriction in order to be able to 
display the function better. This is about 

35
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,770
Christina. Christina can no longer 

36
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,030
come to lessons on Wednesday, 

37
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,570
but would like to 

38
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,590
attend lessons on Saturday this week. 

39
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,870
And this is about mathematics. And 

40
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,910
that's why I've 

41
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,610
already restricted the subject 
accordingly. 

42
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,370
I have 

43
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,130
activated this postponement mode. Now I go 
to the 

44
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,850
student, click 

45
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,750
once on the student 's reference line and 
it 

46
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,350
turns orange. 

47
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,370
I then look at the course that 

48
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,690
Christina would like to attend in the 
future. 

49
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,410
For this Saturday, 9.9., 

50
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,250
she would like to 

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,930
come to class at 10.30 am. That means my 

52
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,190
mouse is not drawn, nothing is 

53
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,930
held. I go to the 

54
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,250
target, click 

55
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,870
on it briefly and the system interprets 

56
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,070
my action. I would like to 

57
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,830
move a participant. This 

58
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,010
shift takes place from the Wednesday 
course 

59
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,710
with the teacher. The participant is 

60
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,650
named. In the new course, the 

61
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,770
change takes effect on 9.9. The first 

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,610
question I am asked is whether it is 

63
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,690
a one-off change 

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,510
, i.e. a change from 

65
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,350
Wednesday to Saturday in 

66
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,770
mathematics, or whether it will be a 

67
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,430
complete change in the future. I 

68
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,250
decide to make a one-off 

69
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,210
change, save the process 

70
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,930
and now see that Christina 

71
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,870
is excused here and here she is with the 

72
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,950
extra lesson. 

73
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,850
I would like to open a second example 

74
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,130
in which Robin will no longer be 

75
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,390
able to come to class on Wednesdays 

76
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,390
due to the timetable change, 

77
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,230
but will now 

78
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,610
attend class on Saturday at 12 noon . 

79
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,970
Here, too , I have 

80
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,510
activated the shift mode. I go 

81
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,430
to the student's line, click 

82
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,910
on it once, it changes color, go 

83
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,650
to the target and select 

84
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,030

85
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,470
attendance as the second option. Will 
always 

86
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,950
take place on Saturdays from now on . 
Until the next 

87
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,140
change. Save. You can see here that 

88
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,140
participation has ended and 

89
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,420
Robin is a major participant here. 

90
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,970
suitable course. I invite you to 

91
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,870
give it a try, have fun 

92
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,430
and wish you every 

93
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,990
success.
