1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,750
So, good evening to 

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,710
you all. My name is Sarah. 

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,690
Welcome to our presentation 

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,810
today. Today we will be 

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,730
discussing the topic of text comparison 

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,250
. First of all, 

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,290
you can all hear me. Just a 

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,670
quick message in the chat, please. 

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,080
I've just seen, has anyone 

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,960
new joined? 

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,240
Just give me some quick feedback, 

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,340
please. That would be great. 

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,640
Just via the chat. Okay, great. 

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,560
Okay, good. Then I'd say 

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,920
I'll just get started. I'll 

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,040
start by briefly introducing our program 

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,160
for today. We'll 

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,580

19
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,740
talk about the basics of text comparison, 
then we'll 

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,720

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,700

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,960
take a closer look at the procedure, how 
we do it and the structure of a text 
comparison. 

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,820
If you have any questions and there's 
anything you 

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,140
don't understand or 

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,940
words you don't know, 

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,580
just write them to me in the chat 

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,580
and I'll try to 

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,370
answer them. So let's start with 

29
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,550
the basics. What is 

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,450
a text comparison anyway? A 

31
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,630
text comparison or a comparison 

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,890
in general is an examination of 

33
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,350
two texts for similarities and 

34
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,070
differences. It is very rare 

35
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,210
that you 

36
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,810
have to compare several texts with each 
other, but 

37
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,510
this is rather unlikely. 

38
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,790
At school, it is usually the case that you 

39
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,970
only have two texts that you 

40
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,570
have to compare with each other. These 

41
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,350
can be non-fiction texts, 

42
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,490
but they can also be poems or 

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,060
short stories. We have 

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,800
different comparison criteria, 

45
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,960
i.e. what can we 

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
compare our text to ? What 

47
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
options do we have? 

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,940
One thing that always comes to mind, of 
course, 

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,800
is the content. 

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,020
In other words, we look at what 

51
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,820
the text examines and how 

52
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,220
it examines it. Then the language. 

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,720
Theme and motifs, i.e. what 

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,500
does the author want to achieve with it, 

55
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,060
why is he doing it, the 

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,980
author 's intention , which target group 
is being 

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,140
addressed, i.e. who is the text intended 
to 

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,480
reach, what effect does the 

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,080
text have , what arguments does it put 
forward, 

60
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,360
this is particularly useful with 

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,580
non-fiction texts, what is the structure 
of 

62
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,080
the text, for example with 

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,280
poems, what form 

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,520
do we have , exactly. And that is usually 

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,740
a written elaboration 

66
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,760
of the comparison. 

67
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,890
So that brings us to the 

68
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,010
procedure. How do we do that? So, 

69
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,150
first of all, it's very, very important in 

70
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,010
the work, or even if you 

71
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,310

72
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,250
've been given a work assignment , to 

73
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,130

74
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,210
read through the texts or poems or 
whatever very, very carefully . That is 
important. Read the 

75
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,970
text several times if you 

76
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,070
don't quite 

77
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,890
understand it the first time. Then it is a 
good 

78
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,650
idea to 

79
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,870
make bullet point summaries. 

80
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,250
This means, for example, that you can 

81
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,050
first 

82
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,710
look at poem A and poem B , then 

83
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,550
make notes on poem A, notes on poem B and 
then 

84
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,950
see, okay, what similarities 

85
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,010
and differences do I have there? 

86
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,230
It could be, for example, that we 

87
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,470
have two poems that 

88
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,510
come from the same period, 

89
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,370
have the same theme, but 

90
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,710
deal with it in different ways. 

91
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,270
For example, one 

92
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,490
poem criticizes something and the other 
poem 

93
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,050
speaks for something. That would be an 

94
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,390
example. 

95
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,430
Then we basically make a 

96
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,270
sketch. It's not about 

97
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,270
painting a picture, but 

98
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,050
about roughly 

99
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,550
recording the structure of a comparison 

100
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,810
with the notes we have already 

101
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,410
made and possibly adding to them. 

102
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,930
In other words, we build 

103
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,150
up a structure. 

104
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,390
I'll show you what this structure looks 
like on the next 

105
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,450
slide or the one after that. Then it 

106
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,410
also makes sense to perhaps 

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,410
create a table with comparative features 
and 

108
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,590
two columns for each text. 

109
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,090
In other words, you think about 

110
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,730
exactly which features I want to 

111
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,290
compare . Of course, you may 

112
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,610
not be able to do all of them depending on 
time, but there are 

113
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,530
definitely some that 

114
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,210
are predominant and more important 

115
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,170
. The 

116
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,390
formulation in the 

117
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,870
present is very important. 

118
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,770
So, the first step is to find 

119
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,370
the starting point for the comparison. 

120
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,170
So, where do we actually start? 

121
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,050
We look at the hypothesis for the 

122
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,730
respective statement intentions and 

123
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,910
write them down. In other words, we 

124
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,630
think about what the author might 

125
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,450
have meant, what he 

126
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,470
might want to tell us. We 

127
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,030
don't always know that , especially in 
poems 

128
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,010
, it doesn't say that the poet 

129
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,110
wrote, I want to 

130
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,530
tell you that nature 

131
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,570
is beautiful or something like that. 
That's 

132
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,790
usually not what it says, but something 

133
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,490
we have to infer, we as 

134
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,250
readers. And we formulate 

135
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,910
a hypothesis about it , i.e. what it 

136
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,170
will probably be about, 

137
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,390
or what 

138
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,230
the aim of the text in question is likely 
to be. 

139
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,230
What is the same in both topics? 

140
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,530
In other words, theme, motifs 

141
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,950
, form, time and 

142
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,150
place of origin and what do they want to 

143
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,790
convey? In the second step, 

144
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,850

145
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,110
we analyze each text individually and 
interpret 

146
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,330
it. In other words, we look at the 

147
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,890
language, we 

148
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,890
may look at the theses or the 

149
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,410
author 's statements and then we interpret 
them. What 

150
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,710
does the author want to tell us? 

151
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,090
With poems in particular, 

152
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,350
we often 

153
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,470
have to interpret a lot and we do this for 
each 

154
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,250
text individually. We then find 

155
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,150
out what is special about 

156
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,930
the text and what significance 

157
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,830
the special features have for the effect 
of 

158
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,190
the text. For example, if 

159
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,730
someone uses a lot of metaphors in their 

160
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,350
poem, what effect does that have on 

161
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,310
you as a reader? 

162
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,900
In the third step, we 

163
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,160
now compare the two texts with each other. 

164
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,420
In other words, we first have text A, 

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,400
then text B and now we 

166
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,180
basically merge them together. 

167
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,960
In other words, which aspects are suitable 

168
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,120
for comparison? 

169
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,740
We then have to think about that. Where 

170
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,720
are the differences? And what 

171
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,960
is perhaps also similar? And how 

172
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,520
can these differences be explained? 

173
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,780
Why do they arise? In other words 

174
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,380
, it doesn't make sense to always 

175
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,160
pick out the points where everything 

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,620
is the same. That doesn't really 

177
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,800
provide much of a comparison, because then 

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,900
I wouldn't have to compare the texts with 
each other 

179
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,040
, but I would 

180
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,640
also look at the differences. 

181
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,240
Of course, if we say, okay, we 

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,500
now have two texts that 

183
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,220
deal with the same topic 

184
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,500
, then that is of course a 

185
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,360
similarity 

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,420
that is worth mentioning. But we 

187
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,700
don't say something like, yes, the 
structure is 

188
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,920
exactly the same. It doesn't 

189
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,480
necessarily have to be. We 

190
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,600
also look at the differences. And at the 

191
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,420
end we make a 

192
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,940
statement. 

193
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,640
An opinion or an assessment 

194
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,520
. In other words, what is important to the 

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
two authors? How do they convey 

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
this message? Perhaps also, which 

197
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,980
is more convincing? Which text is 

198
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,720
more convincing? Which one is less 

199
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,420
convincing and why? That would be 

200
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,740
something you 

201
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,980
could do, for example. And how can today's 

202
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,400
readers deal with this? This is 

203
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,040
particularly relevant when texts 

204
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
are very, very old. So 

205
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,860
now we come to the more precise 

206
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,860
structure. As always, as with 

207
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,280
every essay , we have an introduction, 
main body 

208
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,320
and conclusion. We start, of course, 

209
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,780
with an introductory sentence. There we 

210
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,280
mention the names of both authors 

211
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,860
, i.e. both texts, the two titles 

212
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,340
and the two publication dates and 

213
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,660
places. Then we 

214
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,060
briefly present the content of each text. 

215
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,340
It's important not to be too precise 

216
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,020
, but really short and 

217
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,240
concise. What is it about? What is 

218
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,060
roughly the plot? 

219
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,020
Things like that. Then we place the whole 
thing in 

220
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,620
a social, political 

221
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,480
and/or literary context 

222
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,600
. That means we look at 

223
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,780
the time in which the poem 

224
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,380
was published 

225
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,760
and then think, okay, what happened during 
that time 

226
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
? For example, what happened during 

227
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,300
the Second World War or the 

228
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,620
First World War? Then we can 

229
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,940
think, okay, what would be the 

230
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,920
political context in it? 

231
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,000
But it can also be literary, 

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,760
which means we look at the 

233
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,640
time in which it was written, which era 

234
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,500
it is. Exactly. And then we 

235
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,420
present the comparative framework, i.e. 

236
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,120
we look at whether we want to look at the 
topic 

237
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,320
or the motif, the 

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,740
argumentation patterns and the structure 

239
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,820
of the texts. That's the 

240
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,900
transition to the main part , so to speak. 

241
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,540
Then we 

242
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,040
move on to the main part. The aim here is 
to 

243
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
identify similarities or 

244
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
differences in content. In other words, we 

245
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
first concentrate on the 

246
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,200
content. Of course, we 

247
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
first need to 

248
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,120

249
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,800
have analyzed the texts in full, as 
already mentioned below. We 

250
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,920
can't 

251
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,840
identify any similarities or differences 
if we 

252
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,100
haven't yet 

253
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,740
taken a closer look at the texts. You 

254
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,420
always have to imagine that you're 

255
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,200
writing a text for someone who 

256
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,880
doesn't have both texts in front of them. 
This 

257
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,580
doesn't mean that you 

258
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,840
quote the entire text in full and 

259
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
reproduce it in full , but also the 

260
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,160
most important building blocks of the 
texts so that 

261
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,940
someone who 

262
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,000
doesn't know the texts you have 

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
can understand what you're 

264
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,980
actually talking about . That is always 
very, 

265
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,620
very important. But that doesn't just 
apply 

266
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,260
to text comparison, but also 

267
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,520
to interpretation, 

268
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,180
text summaries, 

269
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,480
text descriptions and things like that. 

270
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,060
And of course we also look at the 

271
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,120
linguistic aspects. Because 

272
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,080
you can often 

273
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
find similarities or differences 

274
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,180
that can also be linked very well to the 

275
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,520
temporal aspects. 

276
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,940
For example, there are certain 

277
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,940
linguistic phenomena that 

278
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,740
appear a lot in a certain era. 

279
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,800
or we think 

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,220
, okay, it's a modern text 

281
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,080
that's not too old yet. 

282
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,540
For example, does it use a lot of 

283
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,000
everyday language, which wasn 

284
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,140
't necessarily typical in the past ? 

285
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,380
We then look at things like that 

286
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,940
. Exactly, so for the typical 

287
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,360
approach, as I said, we 

288
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
first analyze text A and 

289
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,500
then text B. Make sure you 

290
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,680
don't mix them up, because 

291
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,420
otherwise you'll get confused and the 

292
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,900
reader will get confused. Then, on this 

293
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,540
basis of analysis, you compare the 

294
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,500
two texts and then 

295
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,480

296
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,860

297
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,260
take a closer look at the given or 
self-selected aspects of comparison. This 
means, as 

298
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,200
I said, sometimes the 

299
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,960
task already specifies what 

300
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
you should compare, for example 

301
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
the motifs or especially the language 

302
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,080
or especially the... topic or the 

303
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,940
theses. For example, 

304
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,880
you may 

305
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,300
have to compare two factual texts where 
one person 

306
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,080
is arguing for something and the 

307
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,140
other person is arguing against something 
and then 

308
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,860
you have to 

309
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,780
compare them. Or, as 

310
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,140
I said , you select aspects of 
self-comparison. 

311
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,080
And in this analysis, 

312
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,220
or in the second step, 

313
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,660
you then compare 

314
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,360
the texts 

315
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,180
with each other on the basis of these 
aspects. In most cases, a 

316
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,480
complete comparison is not made. This 

317
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,140
means that you cannot 

318
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,240

319
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,600
compare every single point. Especially in 

320
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,340
school work, time 

321
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,160
does not allow for this at all. This means 
that 

322
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,620

323
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,380
if 

324
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,060
you have to pick out really concise 
passages yourself and then compare them 

325
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,520
. Then 

326
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,030
we come to the 

327
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,390
final part. Here we summarize the 

328
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,350
results taking 

329
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,190
the aspects into account. In other words, 
we 

330
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,570
don't suddenly 

331
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,470
pull up something completely different and 

332
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,510
continue to analyze and compare 

333
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,470
. That's not the point, 

334
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,230
but we look at what 

335
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,110
we've already done before 

336
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,610
and try to 

337
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,150
draw a conclusion. With literary texts, 

338
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,070
it also makes sense to 

339
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,670

340
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,950

341
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,310
convey the differences based on the 
publication of the works or in the 
existing epoch . to look at, especially in 
the 

342
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,590
final section. That's what I 

343
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,630
said earlier, that you 

344
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,790
then consider, I don't know, 

345
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,550
if this 

346
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,570
was written during the war, for example, 
or if the 

347
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,470
two poems 

348
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,310
were written at the same time , then let's 

349
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,170
just look at, okay, how does one 

350
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,870
poet deal with the topic and how does 

351
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,050
the other? With non-fiction texts, for 

352
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,930
example, it makes sense to 

353
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,010

354
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,290
examine the coherence of the arguments and 
the persuasiveness. 

355
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,050
In other words, which side 

356
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,170
convinced me more? Am I 

357
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,230
now more likely to think that person A 

358
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,790
was right in what they said, 

359
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,050
or rather person B? And why is that the 

360
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,490
case? How valid are the 

361
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,110
arguments? 

362
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,890

363
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,030
Do I like the meaning or the examples that 
the person has chosen, do I like them or 

364
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,950
not? And why? 

365
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,130
Exactly. And at the end, it makes sense to 

366
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,930

367
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,990

368
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,650
conclude the whole thing with a personal 
statement. In other words, in this 

369
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,410
part you can also express yourself 
personally 

370
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,870
or yourself about a topic or about 

371
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,810
the two texts. 

372
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,230
Of course, it is important that you 

373
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,770
remain objective and do not 

374
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,690
argue from a first-person perspective. In 
other words, don't 

375
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,790
use I think so, but 

376
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,910
relate it to a wider context. 

377
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,690
The text is not about your 

378
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,310
opinion as such, but 

379
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,410
about you 

380
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,090

381
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,310
presenting the whole thing as objectively 
and clearly as possible. 

382
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,680
So, we've actually come to the 

383
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,320
end of our presentation. 

384
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,280
But now I'd like to ask 

385
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,440
if you have any questions 

386
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,520
about the topic. What did you not 

387
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,160
understand? What was difficult for you 

388
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,460
? Or anything else? Things. 

389
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,580
Feel free to give feedback. 

390
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,640
Are there any 

391
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:50,960
questions so far ? 

392
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,500
Okay, apparently there are no questions. 

393
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,100
If 

394
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,540
you want me to go back to a slide , that's 
of course 

395
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,180
no problem. Then I can do that 

396
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,900
too. We 

397
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,170
can also, if you like, 

398
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,210
I see the others have all 

399
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,970
disappeared, we can also 

400
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,290

401
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,410
look at a sample task again if you're 
interested 

402
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,970
. Then it would be great if you could give 
me 

403
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,430
some feedback. 

404
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,960
You don't have any questions. Okay, then 

405
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,320
I wish you, 

406
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,660
unfortunately the others have already 
left, but you're still 

407
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,360
here, then I wish you a 

408
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,940
nice evening. Thank you for your 

409
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,920
attention and see you soon.
