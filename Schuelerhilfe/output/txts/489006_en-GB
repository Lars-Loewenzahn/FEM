00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,050
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,070
a new learning video from 

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,070
Schülerhilfe . Today I'm going to explain 

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,090
the jussif, the hortative and the 

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,390
prohibitive. In Latin, you can 

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,290
also use the subjunctive 

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,110

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,330
to express commands, requests or 
prohibitions . 

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,030
You can find the technical terms here. 
Commandments are called 

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,650
jussif in Latin. Requests 

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,350
are called hortatives or adhortatives 

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,410
and prohibitions are 

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,150
called prohibitives . You should 

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,950
memorize these terms. 

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,170
Commandments, requests and 

16
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,890
prohibitions are negated by the Nee. You 
will see this 

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,050
in the examples in a moment 

18
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,230
. 

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,940
Let's first take a look at the 

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,720
yusif. The term Yusif 

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,100
is derived from Jubere, which means to 

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,320
command . 

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,330
The yusif can either be in the 

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,830
third person and then 

25
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,770
it is... 

26
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,550
an indirect command. If the justif 

27
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,200
is in the second person, then 

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,300
we have a general command. The justif 

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,780
is in the present subjunctive and 

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,180
translates as should. Let's take a look 

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,420
at some examples. 

32
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,560
Liberi in horto luderd. As you can see, 

33
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,980
the subjunctive present tense 

34
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,280
is in the third person plural. And 

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,860
translated, the children should play in 
the 

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,600
garden. Here you can see that 

37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,680
we have 

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,330
used the translation sollen. Let's take a 
look 

39
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,450
at an example of the second 

40
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:45,510
person . Ne quemquam iredias. Here 

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,690
you can see the 

42
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,030
present subjunctive again , this time in 
the second 

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,290
person . And here you translate, you 

44
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,930
shouldn't or you shouldn't 

45
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,190
laugh at anyone. As you can see, we've 

46
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,110
used the word sollen again for the 

47
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,630
translation. 

48
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,570
Yes, then let's take a look at the 

49
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,310
hortative. This word is 

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,150
derived from hortari, to invite. And it 

51
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,310
is a 

52
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,790
request to the first person 

53
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,170
plural. Hortative is also in the 

54
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,010
present subjunctive and translates 

55
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,330
as let us or will we. 

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,910
Another translation option 

57
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,890
is to change the verb and 

58
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,370
subject. 

59
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,470
Let's take a look at an example of what 
this means 

60
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,790
. The 

61
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,260
first example is, in tabernam 

62
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,460
eamus. Here you can see the subjunctive 

63
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,120
of their in the first person plural. 

64
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,940
And we translate, let's 

65
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,600
go to the inn. Remember, the 

66
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,040
hortative is translated as, let's. 

67
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,760
Or, now let's take a look at 

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,940
the translation with the 

69
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,040
change, let's go to the inn. 

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,920

71
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,940
Another example is ne kesemus. 

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,400
Again, you see it in the first 

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,980
person plural, subjunctive. And 

74
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,400
this time we'll just translate it again 

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,720
as let's not dawdle. 

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,050
Yes, and then finally let's take a look 

77
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,790
at the prohibitive. 

78
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,890
You use the prohibitive instead of the 

79
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,490
uncommon negated 

80
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,770
imperative. The term is 

81
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,370
derived from prohibere and means 

82
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,990
to forbid. It is a prohibition to the 

83
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,710
second person. Yes, how do you form the 

84
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,870
prohibitive? Take an NE and put 

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,710
a subjunctive perfect after it. 

86
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,250
Or another way to 

87
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,570
form it is Noli or in the plural 

88
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,150
Nolite plus infinitive. Let's take 

89
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,670
another look at this. Two 

90
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,850
examples. NE Fleveres. Here 

91
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,950
you see a subjunctive perfect in 

92
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,770
the second person and 

93
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,630
does not translate wines. In the plural it 
would 

94
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,970
read Ne fleveritis, 

95
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,480
don't cry. 

96
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,690
And if we 

97
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,190
use the other option , we put a nulli or 

98
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,250
a nullite in the plural and 

99
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,110
the infinitive fleere after it. This 
brings us 

100
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,150
to the summary 

101
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,790
. On the one hand, you have 

102
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,490
learned about the justitive. 

103
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,550
This is either an indirect 

104
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,290
command to the third person, as you 

105
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,210
can see in the first example, liberi 

106
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,130
ludant . As you can see, the 

107
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,830
present subjunctive is in the third 

108
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,790
person and is simply translated 

109
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,250
as sollen. The children should 

110
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,650
play. Then the yusif can also 

111
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,310
express a general prohibition, as you 

112
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,390
can see in the second example. Ne 

113
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,890
quemquam iredeas. Man 

114
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,060
or you should not laugh at 

115
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,440
or mock anyone . Next, 

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
we 

117
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,880
learned about the request to the first 
person plural. This was 

118
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,100
the hortative or ad hortative. In 

119
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,500
tabernam eamus. Here you see a 

120
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,840
subjunctive in the first person 

121
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,840
plural and as we learned, 

122
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
we translate it as let us. 

123
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,100
Let's go to the inn. Finally, 

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,240
we looked at the prohibitive 

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,130
. 

126
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,210
It's a prohibitive to the second person 
and 

127
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,790
it's formed with ne, as you 

128
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,750
can see here, and a subjunctive perfect, 

129
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,390
fle would be, don't cry. Or 

130
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,690
another possibility, noli or nolite 

131
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,370
plus an infinitive and the 

132
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,510
translation remains the same, weine 

133
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,790
nicht. Thank you for your 

134
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,570
attention and see you next 

135
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,910
time.
