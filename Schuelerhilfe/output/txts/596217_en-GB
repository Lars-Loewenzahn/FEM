00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,450
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,630
Schülerhilfe learning videos. In 

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,470
this module, we look at 

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,450
the question of how to recognize good and 

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,430
better sources. And, are there 

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,910
any bad sources with 

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,750
false information? 

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,280
We will therefore first look at 

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,960
how you 

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,900
can recognize trustworthy sources . We 
will then look 

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,920
at how to evaluate sources 

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,240
using Wikipedia and 

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,240
forum posts as examples. Finally, we 

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,780
take a closer look at bad sources 

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,320
. We'll compare good and 

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,420
bad sources and look at 

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,520
examples. 

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,180
Let's start with how you 

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,860

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,980
can recognize trustworthy sources . In 
Module 3, you have already 

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,080
learned what characteristics a 

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,920
trustworthy source 

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,880
should have. There should be no 

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,660
spelling mistakes. 

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,180

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,920
There should be reputable and high-quality 
images 

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
. In addition, the structure should be 

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
clear and the link list 

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,440
well maintained. Beware of sites 

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,780
that do not have an imprint. 

31
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,540
The up-to-dateness of the page can also be 

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,480
an indicator of seriousness. 

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,020
Factual and neutral explanations 

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,980
as well as well-founded evaluations speak 

35
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,660
for a trustworthy source. 

36
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,400
First check what the aim of the 

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,140
website is . Is it a 

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,440
commercial site, i.e. is something being 

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,260
sold or advertised? Is it a 

40
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,420
purely informative site? Or is 

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,040
the aim of the site different? Who is 

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,460
the operator of the site? 

43
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,260
Is it a person, an 

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,380
organization or an association? 

45
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,760
Does the site 

46
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,800
cover current events, for example 

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,540
, or does it present a product? 

48
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,200
In any case, check the author and the 

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,960
imprint. What is the 

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,720
author 's name ? Is it an 

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,000
organization? What 

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,620
information does the imprint provide? If 
the 

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,940
operator of the site is a 

54
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,160
scientific institute, a 

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,240
public institution or a 

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,580
well-known expert, 

57
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,040
this indicates a trustworthy 

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,540
source. 

59
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,650
Let's take a closer look at the 

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,350
evaluation of sources. 

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,380
Wikipedia entries or forum posts 

62
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,580
should always be critically scrutinized 

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,000
, as the articles are mainly 

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
written and 

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,740
reviewed by private individuals. The 
content can therefore 

66
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,800
be incorrect. 

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,860
You should therefore 

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,320
not rely exclusively on Wikipedia for your 
research 

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,920
, but rather use it to get an 

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,960
overview and 

71
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,260
find other sources. 

72
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,280

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,820
Cite the sources found in the Wikipedia 
article as primary sources, but not the 

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,120
Wikipedia article itself. 

75
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,300
You need to be even more careful if 

76
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,760

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,480
you want to use information from forum 
posts. Because 

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,380
nothing is checked here. 

79
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,030
Therefore, 

80
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,510
always check information from Wikipedia or 
forums by 

81
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,510

82
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,450

83
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,050
comparing it with other sources such as 
books, magazines and websites. 

84
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,750
How can you recognize a good 

85
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,230
Wikiatge? It should have a neutral and 

86
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,170
objective choice of words and 

87
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,890

88
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,490
deal with different points of view on the 
topic. It should 

89
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,370

90
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,130
offer the reader the opportunity to form 
an opinion. The sources should 

91
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,730
be carefully cited. 

92
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,910
Furthermore, there should be no 
contradictions 

93
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,150
. Let's 

94
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,730
now look at bad sources and 

95
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,470
how they compare to good 

96
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,770
sources. The first 

97
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,530
question is how to 

98
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,750
distinguish between relevant and 
irrelevant websites 

99
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,870
. Let's look at 

100
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,150
the example of the website 

101
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,190
www.bee-info.de. The following links on 
the 

102
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,850
subject of bees are displayed there. 

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,300
In the left-hand column, we see 

104
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,140
websites from official 

105
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,020
bodies such as universities, offices 

106
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,220
or institutions. In the right-hand 

107
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,900
column, the operators are either 

108
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,580
private or unclear. Websites 

109
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,400
from official bodies are always 

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,180
more reliable than those from private 

111
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,700
operators. Who 

112
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,030
operates the website and 

113
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,570
for what purpose? Look for a 

114
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,330
menu item that 

115
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,390
gives you information about this. You will 
often find something like 

116
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,130
about this site, about us, who 

117
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,870
we are or similar. Every 

118
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,770
website must contain 

119
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,710
a link to the so-called imprint on the 
main page 

120
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,330
. The official 

121
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,950
operator of the site is named there. 

122
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,500
Let's take the 

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,380
search engine fragfin.de as an example. If 
you 

124
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,020
scroll to the bottom of the page, you will 

125
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,760
find the links to FIN, 

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,260
Data protection and Imprint. This is 

127
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,680
a first indication of 

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,420
seriousness. 

129
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,600
However, take a closer look at these links 

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,780
to be able to assess the seriousness . 

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
Next, let's look at an 

132
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,980
example from Wikipedia of how to 

133
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,360

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
find out the type and purpose of a 
website. 

135
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,000
At the bottom of the Wikipedia homepage 
you will 

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,080
find the following information. 

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800
Under the link about Wikipedia 

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
you will find information about the 

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,260
type and purpose of this page. 

140
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,530
At the bottom of 

141
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,910
the page on Google you will also find the 
item about Google. 

142
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,830
On the following page you will find 

143
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,380
the imprint. As an example, you can see 

144
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,780
the Google legal notice here. 

145
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,690
Once we 

146
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,290
have checked the website in general for 
seriousness, 

147
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,730
we turn to the content or the article 

148
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,050
in particular. Are there any details 

149
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,950
or references to the basis on which 

150
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,430
an article was created? 

151
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,390
Look for footnotes, 

152
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,090
sources or references at the end of the 
article. 

153
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,410
Embedded links in the 

154
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,220
article can also help. In Wikipedia 

155
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,580
 articles, you will find 

156
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,660
the subsections 

157
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,660
Underlying literature, Web links 

158
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,640
and Individual references in the table of 
contents. 

159
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,890
Check whether the content is correct. 

160
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,810
Compare the information 

161
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,730
on Wikipedia with other 

162
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,630
websites and, if possible, with 

163
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,430
a printed encyclopaedia or 

164
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,290
specialist literature. 

165
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,910
At the beginning or end of an article 

166
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,890
you will find various icons 

167
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,970
that can help you to 

168
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,930
better assess the quality of an article. 

169
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,450
There is a red icon with an L, 

170
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,230
a blue icon with an L and a 

171
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,830
green icon with a star. 

172
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,790
The red icon with an L means 

173
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,130
that the article 

174
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,250
needs to be revised and 

175
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,490
is therefore not a reliable source. The 
blue icon with an 

176
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,350
L means that the article is on a 

177
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,390
list of articles worth reading 

178
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,650
but does not yet meet the strict 

179
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,330
criteria. Nevertheless, 

180
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,110
the article has been 

181
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,560
edited to an above-average standard . The 
green icon with a 

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,520
star means that the article 

183
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,220

184
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,440
has been included in the list of excellent 
articles. It meets 

185
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,560
strict criteria and usually contains 

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,860
reliable information. 

187
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,850
Here you can see 

188
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,790
what such an icon 

189
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,310
looks like in an example article. 

190
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,170
Nevertheless, these 

191
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,510
awards should not be 

192
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,970
trusted blindly , as they are based on the 

193
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,150
ratings of other authors. This means that 

194
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,690
there is no absolute certainty 

195
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,510
that the content of the 

196
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,670
article is all correct. 

197
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,030

198
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,450
You can find out exactly how the rating of 
Wikipedia articles works 

199
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,290
at this link. 

200
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,030
In conclusion, it can be said that 

201
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,950
the hurdle is high for a source to be 

202
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,270
considered reputable and of high quality 

203
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,410
. So 

204
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,610
, yes, there are sources with 

205
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,940
false information. 

206
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,660
Thank you for your attention and good 

207
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,620
luck with evaluating sources.
