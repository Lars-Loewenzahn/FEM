00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,690
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,650
Schülerhilfe learning videos. Today 

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,230
you will learn about the other 

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,250
functions of PowerPoint and 

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,730
the media design of 

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,750
presentations. 

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,860
In Module 2, you have already 

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,220

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,060
learned about the basic functions of 
PowerPoint. Today you will 

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,040
learn about changing the 

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,940
font, inserting images, 

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,320
placing text and 

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,960
images, the color scheme of 

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,760
slides and inserting 

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,440
animations. You 

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,820
have already learned how to change the 
size and type of 

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,640
font. 

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
PowerPoint also has other 

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,240
change functions, such as 

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,060
color and alignment. You can find these 

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,100

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,600
by clicking on Start in the ribbon and 

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
using the corresponding icons. You can 
also set the 

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,160
text to bold, italic or 

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,800
underline. 

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,310
You can also 

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,210
insert various shapes into your 
presentation, 

28
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,170
such as rectangles, dashes, 

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,690
different types of arrows, ellipses 

30
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,030
or brackets and much, much 

31
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,890
more. You can also change the color of the 

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,850
outline and fill as well as the 

33
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,290
thickness of the outline. To 

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,640
insert a shape, search for it in the 

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,220
Insert ribbon and click on 

36
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,020
Shapes. 

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,540

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,700
Select the desired shape in the window 
that appears below . 

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,220
Click on the position in the slide where 
you 

40
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,140
want to insert the shape 

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,320
and hold down the mouse button. 

42
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,440
You can set the 

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,240
size by dragging the mouse. Then release 
the 

44
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,760
mouse button. When 

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,460
you click on the shape, 

46
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,760

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,720
a ribbon will automatically appear under 
Format in which 

48
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,300
you can change the shape. Here you can 
change the 

49
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,000
color of the fill and outline as well as 

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
the type and thickness of the outline. 

51
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,460
The size of the shape 

52
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,160
can also be adjusted. 

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,010
There are various options for 

54
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,350
inserting images. 

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,600
Click on Images. Now you can 

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,240

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,360

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,480
insert images that are saved on your 
computer or USB stick . are inserted 
directly. 

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,400
Click on online graphics. In the 

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,640
window that opens, you can 

61
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,800
search for images using the Bing search 
engine 

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,540
and 

63
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,280
insert them directly into your 
presentation. 

64
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,870
If you double-click on your image, 

65
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,710
you can edit it. 

66
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,290
For example, you 

67
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,130
can change the color or contrast, 

68
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,070

69
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,890
assign an image frame or image effect to 
your image , change the orientation, 

70
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,590
crop the image and 

71
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,790
change the size. 

72
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,930
When it comes to visual design, 

73
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,350
less is more. Because too 

74
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,810
much is often confusing, can 

75
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,610
overwhelm the listener and distract them 

76
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,770
unnecessarily. That's why I'll give 

77
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,070
you three more tips. Don't put too 

78
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,610
many pictures on one slide. One 

79
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,650
or two meaningful pictures or 

80
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,390
diagrams are usually enough. 

81
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,110
Only write the most important points 

82
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,890
on the slide and explain other 

83
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,610
aspects verbally. And use 

84
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,690
bullet points instead of formulated 

85
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,110
sentences. 

86
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,690
Here is a negative example. 

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,060
There is too much text on the slide 

88
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,940
. In general, this 

89
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,780
slide contains too much information. 

90
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,680
The information could have been 

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,380
divided into two slides. 

92
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,780
The diagrams are also too small 

93
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,740
to read easily. Here 

94
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,880
you can see a positive 

95
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,220
counter-example. The diagram is 

96
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,900
large enough to be 

97
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,940
read properly. 

98
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,700
There would also have been room for a few 
key points on 

99
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,940
the slide. 

100
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,150
The same 

101
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,150
principle applies to the color scheme : 
don't use too much. 

102
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,150
Generally use colors sparingly and 
consciously 

103
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,150
. Use colors to highlight the 

104
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,350
most important things. 

105
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,330
Only use font colors that 

106
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,010
are clearly visible on the background. 

107
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,210
For example, do not use bright yellow 
lettering on 

108
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,610
a white background or dark gray 

109
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,770
lettering on a black background. Too 

110
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,650
many colors make the slide 

111
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,470
confusing and distract the 

112
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,380
listener unnecessarily. Let's take 

113
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,040
another look at a negative example. 

114
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000

115
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,740
There are too many 

116
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,440
different font colors on this slide . The 
yellow 

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,160
font on a white background is 

118
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,700
difficult to read. 

119
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,380
The colored rectangles are also confusing. 

120
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,280
Here you can see a positive 

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,140
counter-example. The slide is 

122
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,420
generally tidied up and the color 

123
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,340
is used to 

124
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,080
emphasize an important word. 

125
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,440
Under Design, you can change the 

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,200
background of your slide. 

127
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,250
You can also 

128
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,010
select a layout. Set the slide size 

129
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,990
and change colors and the like. 

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,540
If you click on 

131
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,960
Format background , a 

132
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,480
bar will open on the right. 

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,600
You can change the following here. The 

134
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
type of fill, the color and the 

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,340
transparency. 

136
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,450
Only use 

137
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,070
colored backgrounds in exceptional cases , 
as they can be 

138
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,770
distracting and bright or even 

139
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,070
neon-colored backgrounds overwhelm 

140
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,670
the eye. It is better to use neutral 

141
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,730
to pastel-colored backgrounds 

142
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,590
that are not distracting. 

143
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,030
The same generally applies to the layout. 

144
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,090
Here you can see a negative example 

145
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,130
of the choice of background. 

146
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,490
The garish blue color is extremely 

147
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,830
tiring for the eye. 

148
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,910
A neutral 

149
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,550
background or a pastel-colored 

150
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,950
background , for example, is better. You 

151
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,090
can 

152
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,990
group several fields, i.e. texts, shapes 
or images, so that 

153
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,590
together they 

154
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,970
form a single field. 

155
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,910
Click on the desired fields one after the 
other while 

156
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,450
holding down the control key. 

157
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,070
Then click on the right mouse button 

158
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,090
and click on Group. 

159
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,280
When you create your slide, 

160
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,540
you can add so-called animations. 

161
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,880
This allows you to 

162
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,760

163
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,900
make text fields, shapes or images appear, 
disappear 

164
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,500
or change when you move on. To 

165
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,560
insert an animation, click 

166
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,020
on your field and then click 

167
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,660
on Animations at the top. 

168
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,220
Then select an animation, for 

169
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,160
example Appear or Fade. 

170
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,020
You 

171
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,680
can also 

172
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,760
insert multiple animations . To do this, 
click on 

173
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,240
Add animation and select the desired 

174
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,960
animation. On the right-hand side, 

175
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,080
you can specify when the new 

176
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,380
animation should start. 

177
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,820
You can also 

178
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,100
change the order of the animations here by 

179
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,000

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,320
double-clicking on the small number of 
animations in the slide. One 

181
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,660
more tip : it is best to use the group 

182
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,240
 function. This way you don't need to 

183
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,100

184
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,000
insert an individual animation for each 
field . 

185
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,010
When editing the animations 

186
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,030
, your screen should look something like 
this 

187
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,510
. 

188
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,900
This is how it looks in the 

189
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,520
screen presentation. If you 

190
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,580
want to see this too, 

191
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,960
click on F5 in PowerPoint. 

192
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,700
Now you know PowerPoint 

193
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,860
pretty well. In module 4, you will learn 

194
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,280
how to create a handout. 

195
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,580
Thank you for your attention 

196
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,400
and I wish you every success in 

197
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,900
creating your presentation.
