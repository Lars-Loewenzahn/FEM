00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,660
Salut and welcome to 

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,900
a learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,720
Today's learning video is about 

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,820
how to express feelings. 

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,040
There are three different ways to 

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,960
express feelings. First of all 

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,880
with a noun 

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,360
, for example love. Then 

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,860
we can express feelings with an adjective 

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,580
, for example 

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,880
being in love. And we can also 

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,820
express feelings with a verb, for 

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,840
example to love. 

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,300

15
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,920
I'll explain the different emotions I'm 
about to show you with three 

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,200
example sentences . One example sentence 

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,400
contains a noun, the other 

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,980
example contains an adjective and 

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,760
the last example contains a 

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,940
verb. So today we're going to look at 

21
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,400
how we express feelings, or 

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,760
exprimer les sentiments. We start 

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,400
with hope. L'espoir is 

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,600
masculine. Il a l'espoir. He has the 

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,880
hope of getting a good grade. 

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,240
The man is optimistic that he 

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,340
will arrive on time. 

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
And the example with the verb. 

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,120
We hope to find a solution to this 

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,020
problem. We now come to 

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,260
the emotion. La joie, the joy. Sa 

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,840
joie était illimitée. His joy 

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,220
was boundless. Then, tu me rends 

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,740
heureux or heureuse, depending on whether 

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,000
I am male or female. You 

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,920
make me happy. And last but not 

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,240
least, mairie de sa blague. My 

38
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,690
mother laughs at her joke. Now 

39
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,450
I would like to explain to you how to 

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,230
express love. L'amour. 

41
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,150
Masculine, meaning male. L'amour est 

42
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,850
le plus beau des sentiments. 

43
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,370
Love is the most beautiful of feelings. 

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,450
Then the example with the adjective. 

45
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,370

46
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,750
classe. The boy is in 

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,090

48
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,850
next example. La fille adore son 

49
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,170
idole. The girl adores her 

50
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,630

52

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,880

58
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,740
And the The example with the verb le 

59
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,580
fils se rit contre sa mère. The son 

60
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,200
is upset about his mother. We 

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,360
now come to the emotion of hatred. 

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,780
