00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,500
Hi and welcome to the 

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,960
Latin learning videos from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm Tim and today we're talking about 

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,640
the formation of the PPP, i.e. the past 
participle 

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,060
passive. The PPP is one 

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,840
of three participles in Latin. 

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,060

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,460
You can find separate videos on the other 
two participles . 

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,120
So let's take a 

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,940
closer look at the PPP . The basic rule 
for forming the 

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,400
PPP is that we 

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,640
need the verb stem plus T plus 

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,660
the case endings of the A and O 

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,600
 declensions. However, there are some 

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,200
exceptions. 

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,680
Let's take a look at the sound laws for 

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,700
consonantal stems. If the T 

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,400
follows a consonant 

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,140
, certain sound changes occur . 

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,820
I would like to introduce these to you 
now. 

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,280
If the T follows another T or 

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,300
a D, 

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,710
a sound change is made and 

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,090
the double T or D-T is changed to an S or 

25
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,670
double S. 

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,260
If the T follows a C, a Q-U, 

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,260
a G or an H, it becomes 

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,720
C-T. If the T follows an M, it 

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,420
becomes M-P. Or if it follows a B or 

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,040
P, it becomes a PT. 

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,460
I'll show you 

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,700
a few more examples of these sound changes 
in a moment. 

33
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,630
Attention! The verb stem is not 

34
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,730
always identical to the present tense 
stem. 

35
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,070
Let's take a look at the different 

36
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,250
conjugations. The A conjugation. 

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,810
Here the PPP ends in atom. Verbs 

38
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,610
in the A conjugation with perfect Ui 

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,370
end in Itum in the PPP. Here are two 

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,950
examples. 

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,380
Dare is the infinitive. In the PPP 

42
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,980
it is Datum and means 

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,800
given . Sonare with the perfect Sono 

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,700
-I has the PPP Sonitum. 

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,620
Sonitum means sounded in German. 

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,880
The I-conjugation. If the perfect tense 

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,560
of I-conjugation verbs 

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,980
ends in I-Wi , the PPP ends in Itum. With 

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,360
other perfects, a T is 

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,240
added to the stem without an I. 

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Let's take a look at two examples. The 

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
PPP comes from audire and means 

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,340
to hear. The PPP is therefore auditum, 

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,860
heard. 

55
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,020
Aperire, the perfect tense is Aparui. The 

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,200
PPP is apertum. So the I is missing here. 

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Apertum means open. 

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,100
Let's take a look at the E conjugation. 

59
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,100
When the perfect tense of verbs in the E 

60
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,640
 conjugation ends in E like N... 

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,560
the PPP ends in etum. 

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
If the perfect tense verbs end in ui, the 

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,940
PPP ends in itum, not etum. And in 

64
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,300
other perfect tenses, the e is not part 

65
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,900
of the stem. Here are a few examples. 

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,200
Flevi, the PPP is fletum and 

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,780
it means cried. Monoi comes from 

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,560
monere, the PPP is monitum 

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
and this means admonished in German. 

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,240
And finally videre, the perfect tense 

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:30,040
is vidi and here a T is attached to 

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,800
the D, but since we 

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
have a sound change because the T follows 
a 

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,780
D, it becomes an S and the 

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,060
PPP is visum . That means seen. 

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,690
Let's take a look at the 

77
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,150
consonant conjugation. Here 

78
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,470
you have to observe the sound laws 

79
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,790
that we 

80
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,110
have just discussed together. This is 
because consonant 

81
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,870
verbs end 

82
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,110
in a consonant in their word stem. And 
when the T 

83
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,630
follows a consonant, 

84
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,790
there are certain sound changes. Some 
verbs 

85
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,910
in the present tense have an N or an M. 

86
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,250
This is called nasal. And this 

87
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,580
decays in the PPP. Let's take a look at 

88
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,680
a few examples. Consular. The 

89
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,040
PPP is Konsultum and means 

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,220
consulted. Constiturare. The PPP is 

91
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,460
constitutum. And that means 

92
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,040
decided. 

93
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,440
In the word relinquere we now have 

94
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,160
a nasal, i.e. an N. This 

95
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,420
decays in the PPP and becomes relictum, 

96
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
left behind. Consonantal 

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,820
verbs that end in der and whose 

98
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,160
perfect tense ends in didi form 

99
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,660
the PPP in ditum. Redere, 

100
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,520
to give back. The PPP is redditum, 

101
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,780
returned. 

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,260
Finally, let's look at the mixed 

103
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,740
conjugation. In the mixed conjugation 

104
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,760
, the short I of the 

105
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,260
present tense stem does not belong to the 
verb stem. That 

106
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,340
is, Fackere machen. The PPP is 

107
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,020
fact and not fackitum. It means 

108
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,840
made. Kappere is not. Kapitum, 

109
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,900
but Kaptum. So the I expires. 

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,940
Kaptum means made. 

111
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,300
With most perfects in wie 

112
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,040
, you replace the wie in the PPP 

113
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,860
with tum. 

114
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,910
So they advertise. Avients 

115
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,850
become atum. For example, stravi 

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,730
becomes stratum and means 

117
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,210
spread out. Evi 

118
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,410
regularly becomes etum, so the word 

119
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,430
flevi in the perfect tense, the PPP is 

120
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,610
fletum, cried. Ivi, the PPP 

121
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,810
ends in itum, so for example pettivi 

122
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,610
is the perfect tense of petare 

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,390
, the PPP is pettitum, requested. Ovi, 

124
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,930
as a perfect ending, the PPP 

125
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,410
is otum. So movi in the perfect tense, 
motum in the 

126
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,850
PPP, which means moved. And 

127
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,130
finally uvi as a perfect ending. 

128
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,120
The PPP becomes utum. For example, 

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,040
adiuvi, where 

130
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,440
the past participle is adiutum, helped. 

131
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,050
Most perfects end in 

132
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:29,970
sum in the PPP. So läsi, the PPP is 

133
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,650
läsum and means hurt. Mansi in the 

134
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,570
perfect, mansum in the PPP remained. 

135
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Since there is no regular formation of the 

136
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,640
PPP, you should 

137
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
always learn the fourth stem form. 

138
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,160
Thank you for your attention 

139
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,100
and see you next time.
