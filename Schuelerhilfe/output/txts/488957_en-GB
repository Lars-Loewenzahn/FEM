00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,950
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,930
a learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,170
Today I'm going to show you a few 

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,470
practical examples of dependencies. 

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,310
Let's start with the 

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,950
first comic. 

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,350
Let's first translate this comic. 

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,430
Maybe it really is as 

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,430
evil as it seems. I 

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,190
don't remember if dragons 

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,450

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,310
tend to feed on meat or herbs . There's 
only one way to 

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,230
find out. Now let's take 

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,750
a look at where there are deponentials 
here 

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,450
. 

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,310
You'll find the first one in the first 
speech bubble . Like 

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,810
 D-Tour. Like D-Tour is in the 

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,530
presence  here. It's the third person. 

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,390
Don't confuse it with VIDERE. 

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,290
VIDERE means to see. In the 

21
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,350
passive form, VIDERI means 

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,210
to shine. That's how we 

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,370
translated it. To seem. 

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
In the second speech bubble, we have 

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,300
one right at the beginning. REMINISCOR. 

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,460
REMINISCOR is also 

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,780
present tense here , but the first person. 
We 

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,380
have translated it as ERINNERE. I 

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,660
remember. Active. But you can see that 
it's 

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,400
passive here. 

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,380
In this speech bubble we have another 

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,480
deponent, vesci. Vesci is 

33
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,680
always with the applicative, like here, 

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,660
Karne and Herbis. And we have 

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,740
translated it as to nourish. At the end 

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,900
you see an example of a 

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,200
semideponens, solernt, from solere, to 

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,660
nurture . Let's look at an 

39
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,460
example with the prohibitive and 

40
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,760
the imperative. Ne locutus cis 

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,900
denegotis in hoc conviv. 

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Let's translate that again. 

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,420
Don't talk about business at this party. 

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,280
What am I supposed to talk about? 

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Talk about small insignificant 

46
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,860
things. And I have 

47
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,420
seen a tiny little dwarf 

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,320
living in a tiny little tent. Not about 

49
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,600
such small things, you donkey. So, let's 
see 

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,080
where the deponentials are here 

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,180
. We have one right at the 

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,100
beginning. Lakutus cis. You see, there 

53
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,600
's a second version here , 

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,140
perfect subjunctive . And there's a ni in 
front of it, 

55
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,260
so this is a 

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,480
prohibitive, a ban. You shall 

57
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
not speak. 

58
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,340
We have a second subjunctive 

59
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,680
here. Loqua. This is first person 

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,960
subjunctive present. We have 

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,600
translated it here as sollen. What 

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,760
else am I supposed to talk about ? 

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,860
In the very next speech bubble 

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,020
, you'll see an example of an 

65
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,000
imperative. Loquere. Speak. And 

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,080
then we come to a final 

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,080
example. Memento. 

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
Let's translate that again first. 

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,940
And remember, don't take more than 

70
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,820
one piece. Oh dear, I 

71
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,480
don't think I' 

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,180
ve used enough clear words. First of all, 
pay attention, 

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,440
memento is a 

74
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,800
verbum defectivum. If you're not sure 

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,180
what that is, 

76
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,660
maybe watch another video about it. 

77
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,610
Then in the last speech bubble 

78
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,750
, we see an example of an ACI that 
contains 

79
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,050
deponentia. 

80
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,730
We have translated the predicate Abitur 

81
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,770
as I believe. And then you see 

82
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,730
the verb Usam esse. It comes from 

83
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,490
uti, to use, and is in the 

84
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,250
infinitive perfect here. 

85
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,770
This means that it expresses the past 
tense. 

86
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,730
And finally, a practical 

87
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,510
tip. When converting from active 

88
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,150
to passive, the accusative object 

89
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,150
becomes the subject. So if you encounter 

90
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,930

91
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,910
an accusative in a sentence with a passive 
predicate, it 

92
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,150
is probably a 

93
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,710
deponent. 

94
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,470
Thank you for your attention 

95
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,610
and see you next time.
