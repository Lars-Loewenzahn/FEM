Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,770
Latin learning videos from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,430
Today I'm going to explain the 

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,810
reflexive pronouns in the ACI. 

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,370
As a reminder , the ACI is a 

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,190
sentence element and not an independent 

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,550
clause . This means that it cannot 

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,630
stand alone without a main clause. When 

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,150
referring to a subject, the 

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,430
reflexive pronouns and suus are used. Now 

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,270
back to the declension of suus. The 

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,560
genitive is is sui, the dative is zibi, 

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,740
the accusative is se, just like the 

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,960
ablative is se. I have 

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,580
brought the following example sentence. 

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,240
Respondit sese in suo jure impediri. 

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,400
This translates as he responded 

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,160
that he 

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,540
was being hindered in the exercise of his 
right. Now to se. Se 

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,900
is in reference to a superior 

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,560
subject. But it is also 

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,860

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,860
possible to refer to the subject 
accusative . Note that 

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,180
Caesar often uses Cc instead of the simple 
C 

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,800
. C can also be reinforced by Ipse 

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,920
. The construction 

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,940
with Ipse is then in the nominative case. 
I 

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,540
have 

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,280
provided the following example sentences 
for C. 

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,850
This translates as We know that 

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,510
Seneca killed himself. 

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,470
In this case, Se refers to 

33
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,890
Seneca, i.e. to the 

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,370
subject accusative. 

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,290
In the next sentence, 

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,850
which translates, Mark assures 

37
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,070
us that he knows everything, 

38
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,890
the C refers to Mark. Mark 

39
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,470
is the subject here. The subject of the 

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,050
superordinate verb, i.e. the verb 

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,870
of the main clause and the infinitive, 

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,850
can also be the same. Then 

43
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,970
you use the 

44
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,910
subject accusative in Latin. It is 

45
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,970
different in German. The 

46
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,770
subject accusative is expressed here by 

47
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,850
the personal pronouns. I have 

48
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,250
brought you the following example. 

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,730
This translates as I think I 

50
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,650
have done everything. Here the 

51
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,650
subject is I, as I have already indicated 

52
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,630
, but you can see this both in 

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,390
the O, i.e. the personal ending in 

54
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,540
puto, i.e. I believe, and in 

55
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:08,760
me, which also means I in ACI. 

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,000
But you 

57
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,800
don't see that here in the subordinate 
clause that you have in German. 

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,780
In Latin, however, you need 

59
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,520
both forms. Now let's move on to the 

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,340
summary. The reflexive pronoun 

61
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,680
se- in ACI can refer to either the 

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,860
subject accusative or the 

63
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,380
superior subject. With the 

64
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,260
same subject 

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,180
, personal pronouns can be used as the 

66
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,240
subject accusative. 

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,020
