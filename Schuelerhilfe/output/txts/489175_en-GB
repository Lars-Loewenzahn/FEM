00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,730
Hello, I'm delighted that you've 

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,410
joined me again today. 

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,290
In this video, I would like to 

4
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,990
introduce you to a pattern that can be 
used to solve common 

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,270
lottery problems. And 

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,570
I'd like to 

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,770

8
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,570
show you how it works using an example. 
Today we're going to 

9
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,410

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,550
explain the whole thing using the German 
lottery . The aim there is to 

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,090
mark six correct out of 49. 

12
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,930
So we have a lottery ticket with 

13
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,590
49 numbers on it and put six 

14
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,970
crosses on it. It is not important 

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,510
in which order the crosses 

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,810
are marked. A classic 

17
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,330
example is the question of the 

18
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,570
probability of getting 6 correct numbers. 
To 

19
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,950
work out the probability, 

20
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,010
we first consider how 

21
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,610
many possibilities there are to 

22
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,250
place 6 correct numbers. 

23
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,410
We do this using the 

24
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,810
binomial coefficients and the 

25
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,190

26
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,130
calculation is called 49 over 6. 

27
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,610
calculator 

28
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,910
, you can also watch the 

29
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,010
video again. The result is 13 

30
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,350
.983 

31
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,090
.816 

32
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,590
, so there are about 14 million 

33
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,450
ways to 

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,710
place 6 correct 49 numbers. The 
probability 

35
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,250
of this, i.e. how high is the 

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,670
probability of 

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,010
guessing 6 correct numbers , is 1 in about 
14 

38
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,550
million. It gets a little more difficult 
when you 

39
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,610
are asked for 4 out of 6 

40
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,890
correct numbers. So we put 6 crosses 

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,110
and 4 of them are correct. Here, too, 

42
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,170
we first take a look at the 

43
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,370
possibilities. We have first 

44
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,070
calculated how many possibilities 

45
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,250
there are to 

46
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,630
place our 4 correct crosses in the 6 
correct ones and on the 

47
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,430
other hand we have the 

48
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,790
possibilities to 

49
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,330

50
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,550
place our 2 incorrect ones among the 
remaining 43 incorrect ones. 

51
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,810
We divide this product by all the 

52
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,490
possibilities of 

53
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,030
having six correct numbers. The 
calculation is as follows 

54
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,810
. First we multiply 

55
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,610
the possibilities 15 times 903 and 

56
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,510
divide the whole by our 13,983 

57
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,490
.816. and get the 

58
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,550
probability for this 

59
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,170
event. The probability is 

60
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,310
about 0.097% 

61
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,350
, which is very, very low. Another 

62
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,450
type of task is the question about the 

63
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,550
super number. I also have an 

64
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,110
example for this , namely we would like to 

65
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,610
know what the 

66
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,450
probability is of getting three correct 
numbers 

67
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,150
out of six and still hitting 

68
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,150
a super number. It is important to know 
that there 

69
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,290
are ten numbers and we have to 

70
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,210
match one of them for the super number. 
The 

71
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,690
probability of hitting this number 

72
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,530
is therefore one tenth. We 

73
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,150
proceed in the same way as the 

74
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,030
previous example and create the 

75
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,750
lottery model. First, we consider 

76
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,030
how many of the six correct numbers 

77
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,050
we have matched, namely three, 

78
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,070
and multiply this by the 

79
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,850
second binomial coefficient. 

80
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,820
43 over 3, because 

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
we also have 3 of our 

82
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,040
crosses over the 43 remaining numbers. And 
divide the whole thing by 49 

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,820
over 6. Now we 

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,560
add the super number. We have to 

85
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,140
take our solution by another tenth, 
because the 

86
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,480
probability of hitting the super number 

87
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,960
is one tenth. If you 

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,880
don't hit the super number, 

89
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,580
there would be 9 tenths at this point, 
i.e. 

90
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,700
the counter probability. 

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,460
Let's summarize once again. If you want to 

92
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,500
solve a task like this, 

93
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,920
you can use the lottery model 

94
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,380
. This 

95
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,580
page shows how many of the correct 6 you 

96
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,020
have hit. Here are the 

97
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,100
ways in which you 

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,680

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,880
have distributed the remaining crosses 
among the incorrect ones and divide the 
total 

100
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,900
by 49 over 6, i.e. all the 

101
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,380
ways of 

102
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,060
marking 6 correct in 49 . If you are not 
quite 

103
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,400
sure, make sure that the 

104
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,460
two top numbers 

105
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,280
always add up to 49. The same applies 

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,900
to the numbers below. 

107
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,320
The 3 and the 3 must add up to 6 

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,460
. If you have this, then 

109
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,520
you have 

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,320
set up the formula correctly. Thank you 
very much and see you 

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,820
next time.
