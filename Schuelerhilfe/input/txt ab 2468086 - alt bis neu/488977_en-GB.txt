00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,800
Schülerhilfe learning videos. Today we're 

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,480
looking at the basics 

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,120
of writing a scientific 

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,060
text. In this module, you will learn 

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,640
what is important when writing a 

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,520
scientific text. 

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,500
We will first look at the 

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,580
concept of scientificity and 

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,000
then go into the 

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
different types of 

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,780
scientific work. 

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,520
We will then look at the 

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,200
specifics of language and 

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,260
style, form and structure 

16
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,320
as well as page layout. 

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,310
Let's start with the 

18
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,030
scientific nature of texts. What does 

19
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,810

20
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,170
scientific writing actually mean ? 

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
Scientific texts fulfill 

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,980
various criteria. 

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,280
Verifiability. All statements must be 

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,000
marked with references 

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,980
so that they can be checked. 

26
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,280
The sources are given as 

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
short references in the text and 

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,360
as full references in the bibliography. 

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,940
You will learn more about this in Module 
3: 

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,680
Comprehensibility. A person with 

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,360
basic knowledge of the subject area 

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,800
must be able to understand the work. 

33
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,620
Your argumentation 

34
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,100
must be presented logically and 
comprehensibly. 

35
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,370
Reliability or dependability. 

36
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,110

37
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,550

38
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,230
It must be possible to achieve the same 
results when repeating the methods used. 

39
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,950
Therefore, choose 

40
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,450
measurement methods that are as precise 
and reliable as possible. Congruence. 

41
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,850
The paper must address the topic or 

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,370
title of the paper. 

43
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,550
The title should therefore already 

44
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,330
provide information about the content of 
the 

45
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,930
paper. 

46
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,530
New findings. The work must 

47
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,710
make new statements or look at statements 

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,930
from a new perspective 

49
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,430
. Topicality. The basis of the 

50
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,970
work is the current and 

51
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,610
available specialist literature. 

52
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,990
Objectivity. The work is 

53
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,210
written in a neutral form. Personal 

54
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,010
opinions or subjective views 

55
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,410
should not be expressed. 

56
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,230
Furthermore, all statements must be 

57
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,530
justified. Stylistics. The work is 

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,390
factual and clearly written. 

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,440
Now let's take a look at what 

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280
types of scientific papers 

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,760
there are. In a literature thesis, 

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,740
only 

63
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,460
scientific 

64
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,080
findings that have already been published 
are used. This means that 

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,980
the current literature is used, 

66
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,220
but no own data is 

67
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,740
collected. Empirical or 

68
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,520
analytical work or research 

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,640
is different. Here, empirically 

70
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,500
collected data is taken into account. 

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,420

72
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,500
However, the current scientific literature 
forms the basis of the 

73
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,720
work. Empirical means 

74
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,420
based on experience. Empirical 

75
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,160
studies are, for example, 

76
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,960
frequency counts, 

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,840
observation protocols or 

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,620
interviews. A project or 

79
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
company-related paper or 

80
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,220
a practical project 

81
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,140

82
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,960
deals with a specific practical task . 
Here, too, the current 

83
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,240
scientific literature forms the basis of 
the 

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,190
work. How do I write a 

85
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,250
scientific text? 

86
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,530
Above 

87
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,610
all, scientific writing means writing 
factually. 

88
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,770
No feelings, opinions or 

89
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,410
evaluations should be expressed. 

90
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,830
Internal actions such as 

91
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,710
thoughts or monologues should also 

92
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,510
be avoided. Use indirect rather than 

93
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,270
literal speech. 

94
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,150
Be brief, but not too brief. 

95
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,750
In short, provide a concise but accurate 

96
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,430
description of the event without 

97
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,590
digression. It is important to 

98
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,570
maintain an objective point of view. 

99
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,430
Therefore, do not use 

100
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,650
the first person when writing. 

101
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,580
What are the components of a 

102
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,180
scientific paper? 

103
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,700
First of all, there is the cover page, 

104
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,820
which 

105
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,640

106
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,960

107
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,140
should contain the topic, the author's 
first name and surname, the submission 
date and other information. This can be 

108
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,000
followed by several lists. Which 

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,040
lists are required depends 

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,140
on the type and scope of the work 

111
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,880
. Examples are 

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,460

113
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,820
lists of contents, tables, figures or 
abbreviations. 

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,660
Then comes the text of the paper, 

115
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,620
i.e. the main body. 

116
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,480
The main body is followed by the appendix 
and the 

117
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,840
bibliography. 

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,340
All 

119
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,820
sources must be listed in the bibliography 
and 

120
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,420

121
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,460
sorted alphabetically according to the 
author's surname . Finally, 

122
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,120
an affidavit must 

123
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,420
be added stating that 

124
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,220
the work 

125
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,930
was written independently, i.e. without 
outside help. 

126
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,950
The topic is dealt with in the main 
section. 

127
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,970
A reference to the problem must be 

128
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,350
established and the objective 

129
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,790
addressed. It is important to 

130
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,810

131
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,250
pay attention to a logical structure of 
the argumentation . 

132
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,550
The introduction should 

133
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,970
lead to the topic of the paper . 

134
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,630
It is practical to use an example with 

135
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,770
current figures. 

136
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,330
The task or 

137
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,470
problem should also be addressed and the 

138
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,550
objective of the work 

139
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,730
explained in more detail. For example, 
does the thesis deal with 

140
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,750
a special topic or should it provide an 

141
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,490
overview of the current state of 

142
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,670
research? The 

143
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,450
approach to the work should also 

144
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,350

145
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,450
be presented clearly. The 

146
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,430
structure of the paper should also be 
described. 

147
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,010
The conclusion should 

148
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,090
contain a summary and provide an 

149
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,370
intellectual link to the 

150
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,730
problem. In addition, 

151
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,790
an outlook on future 

152
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,110
questions should be given. 

153
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,110
Finally, a conclusion should be drawn 

154
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,650
that 

155
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,130
addresses the critical positions. 

156
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,810
Finally, let's address the question 

157
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,670
of how to design the 

158
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,310
page layout. 

159
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,450
The margins should be 

160
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,090
3 cm at the top and bottom, 4 cm on the 
left and 2 

161
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,870
cm on the right. Use a common 

162
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,050
font such as Times New Roman or 

163
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,210
Arial. The standard font size is 

164
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,590
12, although headings 

165
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,350
can be written larger. The 

166
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,350
text alignment should be set to 
justification 

167
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,450
and automatic 

168
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,330
hyphenation should be activated. 

169
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,030

170
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,110
Line spacing should be set to one and a 
half and the 

171
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,370
sheets should be numbered . 

172
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,220
When numbering 

173
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,120
, make sure that the cover page is not 

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,600
numbered. 

175
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,680

176
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,060
The table of contents, list of 
abbreviations, list of figures, appendix 
and bibliography are numbered using 

177
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,260
Roman numerals. The 

178
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,460
text and the appendix, on the other hand, 
are 

179
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,120
numbered using Arabic numerals. 

180
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,150
Thank you for your attention 

181
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,410
and good luck with the 

182
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,090
text!
