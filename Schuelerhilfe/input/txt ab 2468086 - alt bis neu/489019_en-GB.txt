00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,920
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,980
Schülerhilfe learning video. This video is 

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,160
about the so-called 

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,900
combinatorial counting methods 

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,520
. In particular, the 

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,900
unordered random sample. There is also 

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,120
a video on ordered 

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,260
random sampling. What is an 

9
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,740
unordered sample anyway ? It means 

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,660
that the order 

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,800
is not important. In other words, 
unordered sampling 

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,400
is the same as disregarding the 

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,680
order. But there are also 

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,440
two sub-points. 

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,260
One can be 

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,100
seen as drawing with putting back, the 
other as 

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,940
drawing without putting back. 

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,160
This is a so-called 

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,200
Ohnen model. And drawing with 

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
putting back means that the number 

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,880
of choices always 

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
remains the same and therefore the 

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,940
probabilities also remain the same. And 
when drawing 

24
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,320
without putting back, the balls remain 

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,000
outside and so 

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,860
the number of 

27
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,560
choices changes with every move, and 
therefore also 

28
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,220
the probabilities . Drawing 

29
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,480
without putting the ball back with an 

30
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
unordered random sample is 

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,720
also known as the lottery model. 

32
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,660
However, there is also a separate 

33
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,180
video on this. In this video, we want to 
look 

34
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,000
at drawing with a reserve for 

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,140
unordered samples 

36
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,140
. Let's start with an 

37
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,440
example. Let's imagine the following 

38
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
question. How many 

39
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,380
ways are there to 

40
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,640

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,580
put together five pieces of cake from 
three types? Here we see 

42
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,260
three different flavors, chocolate, 

43
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,620
lemon and strawberry. Now 

44
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,040
we want to take five pieces of cake from 
them. 

45
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,600
Let's imagine, for example, that 

46
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,060
we take two chocolate, 

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,360
two lemon and one strawberry. 

48
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,120
Now we can also start from the right 

49
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,180
and say, one strawberry, 

50
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,660
two lemons and two 

51
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,040
chocolates. We immediately see that 

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
this is exactly the same selection, 

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
even though we 

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,820
have set it up differently . This means 
that 

55
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,820
they have the same meaning and so 

56
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,620
we know that it 

57
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,120
is the same without having to consider the 
order, as it is 

58
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,250
the same twice. 

59
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,710
But now we can also say again why it 

60
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,550
is pulling with putting back. We 

61
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,790
can also imagine that I 

62
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,510
could also 

63
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,190
take five chocolates . In other words, 
there are so many 

64
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,710
pieces of chocolate that it can be 

65
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,170

66
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,510
made up entirely of chocolate. 

67
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,990
That means I always have so many 

68
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,870
pieces of cake, I can always 

69
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,890
choose all the pieces. That's why 

70
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,610
the drag and drop works. 

71
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,870
The number of 

72
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,590
choices does not change, so I can 

73
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,970
choose as many as I like. To 

74
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,570
calculate this task, there is a 

75
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,070
term, which you can see here. n plus k 

76
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,870
minus 1 over k. This is the 

77
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,630
so-called binomial coefficient. 

78
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,790
There is also another video about this. 

79
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,670
But now we first have to be clear 

80
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,010
about what n is and what 

81
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,650
k is . n is the number of 

82
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,810
possible choices. 

83
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,450
We have three different types of these. So 

84
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,070
n is 3. 

85
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,190
k is the number of moves or 

86
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,850
draws. And we want to 

87
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,870
draw 5 pieces of cake. So k is 

88
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,110
5. If we put that in, 

89
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:17,450
we get 3 plus 5 minus 1 

90
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,010
and the whole thing over 5. If we 

91
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,290
work it out, 3 plus 5 is 8, minus 1 

92
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,790
is 7, then we get the 

93
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,650
binomial coefficient 7 over 5. 

94
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,530
I have already 

95
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,230
prepared this for you here . and here 
above 

96
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,190
again as a reminder, n over k is 

97
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,130
n factorial divided by k factorial 

98
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,910
times the difference of the two and 

99
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,810
from this the factorial. That is, 

100
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,790
7 factorial at the top and the product of 

101
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,830
2 factorial times 5 factorial at the 
bottom. If you 

102
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,410
have written this out, you can 

103
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,710
immediately see that you 

104
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,150
can shorten a lot of digits at the top and 
bottom. 

105
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,410
Here I shorten the 2 with the 

106
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,250
6 again and I get the solution 7 times 3, 

107
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,290
i.e. 21 possibilities. Let's 

108
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,510
briefly summarize the whole thing again. 

109
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,550
This video was about the 

110
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,350
so-called unordered random sample. 

111
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,510
This means that the order 

112
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,270
is not important. 

113
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,250
There are two sub-items, one is drawing 

114
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,670
with putting back and the other is drawing 

115
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,270
without putting back. 

116
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,590
We can calculate the draw with a reserve 
with this 

117
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,110
term n plus k minus 1 over k, where n 

118
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,170
is the number of choices 

119
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,250
and k is the number of moves or 

120
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,550
draws. The draw without 

121
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,590
putting back is calculated with the 

122
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,970
binomial coefficient n over k and 

123
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,730
this is the so-called lotto model 

124
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,350
. 

125
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,030
Thank you for your 

126
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,570
attention and I look forward to the 

127
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:56,850
next time.
