00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,300
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,100
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,420
This video is about 

4
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,640
working with a dictionary, more precisely 

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,860
about 

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,880
finding suitable dictionary entries. 
Generally speaking, a dictionary 

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,140
is a reference book, i.e. in the form of 

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,420
a book, or there are also 

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,620
online dictionaries where you 

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,060
can search for the right words. A 

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,180
dictionary is always sorted by 

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,680
alphabet, so it is an 

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,880
alphabetically sorted list of 

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,340
words. 

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,440
When 

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,300
working with a dictionary , it is 
important that you 

17
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,040

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,740
read the user instructions first. These 
are usually 

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,160
written in the front flap. Also 

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,580
important are so-called 

21
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,640
abbreviation directories, where all 

22
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,260
abbreviations 

23
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,780
used in the dictionary 

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,440
are explained. There 

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,740
are also inflection tables, i.e. when 

26
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,920
verbs are conjugated 

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,940
, there are some examples in the 
inflection tables 

28
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,220
and you can already 

29
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,260
recognize an example from them. 

30
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,880
There is usually an 

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,000
appendix at the end of the dictionary , 
where you can find 

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
irregular verbs , for example. 

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,380
The 

34
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,820
lengths of the vowels are important in 
dictionaries . These are always 

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,640
marked. You 

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,420
may have already seen this in your 

37
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,280
own dictionary. A 

38
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,460
normal short vowel 

39
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,860
is written without an addition, a long 

40
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,120
vowel has a line across the top 

41
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,940
and if a vowel is particularly short, 
there 

42
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,960
is a small 

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,400
tick at the top. It is important that you 

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
pay attention to these length marks, 
because 

45
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,420
you can draw conclusions about the 

46
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,320
word from them. Here is an 

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,080
example below. Populus means people. If 

48
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,400
we have this with a long stroke, i.e. 

49
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,140
Populus, then it means poplar. This 

50
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,300
is particularly 

51
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,680
important in poetry so that you 

52
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,340

53
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,780
can find the correct meaning of your word. 

54
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,400
Now let's look at how individual 

55
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,060
words 

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,040
are entered in the dictionary . We start 
with the 

57
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,780
nouns. These are always entered in the 

58
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,740
nominative case and the 

59
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,780
genitive ending is mentioned. 

60
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,180
The genus, i.e. the gender of the 

61
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,280
word, is also stated . With this 
information 

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,060
, you can then draw conclusions 

63
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,780
about the declension to which the word 

64
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,520
belongs. 

65
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,770
Let's 

66
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,330
take a look at some examples. Here we have 
amika, then the 

67
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,110
genitive ending AE. This is feminine 

68
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,490
and therefore belongs to the 

69
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,310
A declension. If we 

70
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,370
have amikus , i.e. the ending us- 

71
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,770
or the genitive ending i at the end and 
the 

72
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,710
indication that it is masculine, then 

73
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,610
we know that we 

74
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,810
can assign the whole thing to the O 
declension. Navis 

75
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,710
with the genitive ending is-feminine 

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,330
, then we know that it belongs to the 

77
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,010
mixed declension. 

78
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,130
Now let's move on to the 

79
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,930
entry of adjectives. Adjectives 

80
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,370
are always entered in the nominative 
singular 

81
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,490
masculine. Nominative 

82
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,430
, that is the case, singular singular 

83
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,830
and masculine masculine. Three-ended 

84
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,150
adjectives can be marked in two 

85
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,850
different ways 

86
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,770
if they 

87
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,210
belong to the A and O declension. Here 
bonus, A 

88
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,810
-um. Bonus means good and can 

89
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,890
either be written in this way with 

90
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,730
Us, A-um. This is 

91
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,050
for the different genders, 

92
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,230
masculine, feminine and neuter. Or 

93
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,210
it can simply be written as Bonus with a 3 

94
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,790
after it. You can 

95
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,310
then recognize from the ending that it is 
a 

96
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,950
three-ending adjective. 

97
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,130
Another example of this is Magnus, 

98
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,050
groß, wieder A um or Magnus with the 

99
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,950
3 after it. 

100
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,770
Adjectives can either be 

101
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,870
written out in full in the dictionary 

102
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,430
or abbreviated. The example here is 

103
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,930
pulka, schön, pulkra, pulchrum, 

104
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,930
abbreviated, here only the ending. Or 

105
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,990
written out in full, as you can see 

106
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,490
at the bottom here , where 

107
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,890
the same endings are added. In the case of 

108
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,090
singular adjectives 

109
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,150
, such as here Felix, glücklich, 

110
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,170
the genitive singular is also given. 

111
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,650
Felikis or abbreviated. 

112
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,370
Next we come to the entry for W. 

113
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,010
Verbs are either 

114
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,250
listed in the infinitive or in the 

115
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,570
first person singular, indicative, 

116
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,790
present active. The stem forms 

117
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,290
are also 

118
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,410
listed in most dictionaries . An example 
of this is Laudare 

119
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,090
or O, i.e. Laudo. Laudo is then 

120
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,970
the first person singular, indicative, 

121
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,210
present, active and either 

122
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,050
this form would be in the dictionary or 

123
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,190
the infinitive, depending on how new 

124
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,590
your dictionary is. After 

125
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,670
the stem form A for atom, the addition 

126
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,410
that it is a verb 

127
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,450
and the different 

128
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,530
meanings, in this case praise. 

129
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,350
In older dictionaries, the 

130
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,450
whole thing is often abbreviated with 
numbers 

131
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,970
from 1 to 4. The numbers then stand 

132
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,710
for the different conjugations. 

133
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,630
1 for the A-conjugation, for example 

134
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,010
laudo, 2 for the E-conjugation video, 

135
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,310
3 for the consonantal or 

136
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,030
mixed conjugation, cupio and 4 for the 

137
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,050
E-conjugation, audio. After the 

138
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,330
different verbs, which are 

139
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,950
all in the first person 

140
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,050
indicative present active, you 

141
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,310
simply 

142
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,830
write the number and you know 

143
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,670
which conjugation the verb 

144
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,730
belongs to. If you 

145
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,470
have certain forms where you don't know 
exactly what 

146
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,850
the form means, you can also 

147
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,670
search for them specifically. There are 

148
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,790
often extra entries, such as 

149
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,110
in this example. Acceptum 

150
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,890
is a verb and the PPP of Akipere. 

151
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,790
In the next step, you can 

152
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,950
search for the meaning in Akipere 

153
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,130
. This would then be preserved. 

154
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,710
Finally, here are a few tips 

155
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,970
for working with the dictionary. 

156
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,550
Firstly, it is important that you read the 

157
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,510
user instructions, which 

158
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,870

159
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,450
are usually listed at the beginning of 
your dictionary . Then it is also 

160
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,890
important that you 

161
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,730
pay attention to the different word types 
that are always 

162
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,910
listed after each word. One 

163
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,630
example is lectus. This 

164
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,790
can be both an adjective 

165
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,930
and a noun. You have to 

166
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,570
make sure that 

167
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,850
you choose the right word. As an adjective 

168
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,310
it means read and as a noun it 

169
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:53,730
means bed. 

170
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,570
You should also always 

171
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,110
read the entries to the end, as 

172
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,890
most words 

173
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,910
have different meanings . Then you have to 
find out 

174
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,470
which meaning matches your word 

175
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,390
. You can also 

176
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,690
watch an extra video about this. 

177
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,210
You can also find different phrases in 

178
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,250
dictionaries and save yourself 

179
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,270
a lot of time when translating. 

180
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,090
Thank you for your 

181
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,130
attention. See 

182
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,650
you next time.
