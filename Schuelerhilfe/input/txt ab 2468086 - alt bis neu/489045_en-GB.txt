00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,590
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,810
another learning video from 

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,670
Schülerhilfe . Having already 

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,450

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,250
explained the basics of lactulian 
hexameter in two videos , 

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,150
I would now like to 

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,710
show you a practical example. 

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,310
To make it 

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,770
easier for you to follow, I 've 

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,070

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,150
written down the basic scheme of the 
hexameter here again and there's also 

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,510
the possible lengths that we 

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,630

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,260
can use instead of the double contractions 
in the first four feet of verse. So, it' 

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,200
s always best to start by 

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,840
looking for position lengths, they are 

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,160
very easy to find. You 

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
just have to be able to count and know 
what 

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,960
consonants are. And the first 

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,020
syllable, that's always very 

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,480
smart too , it's always long, 

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,600
there's no other way. So, let's see, 

23
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,120
we have an MF position here. Then 

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,620
we have RT here, then we have 

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,960
KR here, then we have TM here, 

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,100
STM here , even 3. In the next line 

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,000
we have SK, we have DM, we have 

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,620
Hüsen, even 3. And our MT and 

29
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,820
finally our double L. This 

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,880
means that the vowels before these two 

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,100
or more consonants must 

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,320
be position-long. We can 

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,200
enter that straight away. 

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,670
So, and then we have the 

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:50,910
I, the A, U and the I. So, very 

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,970
nice, you see, we've 

37
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,810
already found a lot. Then, if 

38
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,310
we look here, the last 

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,610
verse foot always has length and then a 

40
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,590
syllable. Ankeps, so 

41
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,730
we' ve found the length , we know it's 

42
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,550
even stressed. Also here and our 

43
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,930
last syllable ankeps. And the fifth 

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,890
verse foot is always a pure 

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,030
dactyl, i.e. short, short stressed 

46
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,150
length. Similarly in the verse below, 
short, 

47
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,870
short stressed length. Here you can see 

48
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,470
that this O is naturally long, 

49
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,230
as it is not followed by two consonants. 

50
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,230
So, let's take another look 

51
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,690
at the first verse: we have I in the 

52
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,710
forte. So, if we 

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,290
look now , there's only one syllable 

54
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,630
between I and O. It has to 

55
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,310
be long , of course, because a double 
short 

56
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,310
also needs two syllables. So 

57
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,290
we have a length, bang, and 

58
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,250
we can mark that. I had just 

59
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,090
introduced you to the law that vowel 

60
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,630
before vowel is shortened. So 

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,750
we know that this i is short. Yes, and 

62
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,810
we had already marked Meos' anyway 

63
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,510
. And a shortness can 

64
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,870
never appear on its own, because the a 

65
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,650
is already long, so either 

66
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,130
this a is short or the e is short. But it 

67
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,610
has to be the e, because three shortenings 

68
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,970
couldn't 

69
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,370
come one after the other or two lengths 
can 

70
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,810
't be followed by a shortness. So 

71
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,430
we can see that the A is long here 

72
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,810
and so we also know the 

73
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,290
ablative case. Like A. So and a 

74
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,090
double length must be followed by a third 
length 

75
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,610
, so here too long A, 

76
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,090
again ablative, one 

77
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,050
syllable remains and that can only 

78
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,750
be the length. So, in the next verse we 

79
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,330
again have a vowel before a vowel 

80
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,930
, so the I is short and then the 

81
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,270
O must also be short. 

82
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,800
So, then we have the A as length, 

83
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,440
in between there are two syllables 

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,580
and they are actually meditans 

85
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,000
short. 

86
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,890
And now let's take a look at 

87
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,750
the back, we have a length here 

88
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,430
, as you know, 

89
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,950
there can only be one other length before 
this length 

90
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,490
and that is a stressed one. 

91
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,370
One syllable remains, the U, and that can 

92
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,090
only be long. 

93
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,530
Of course, you can also read that in a 
fancy way now. I 

94
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,950
bam forte via sacra secut mius est 

95
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,490
mus niscio quid meditans lugarum 

96
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,770
totus in ilis. Meaning, I 

97
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,490
happened to be walking along the via sacra 

98
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,310
, as is my way. And I was meditating 

99
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,950
on something, nesquio quitt, 

100
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,790
on some trifle 

101
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,850
, completely immersed in the nugarum. 

102
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,070
That was an example of how we 

103
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,170
chant a hexameter. 

104
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,790
I look forward to the next time and say 
see you 

105
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,470
then. Bye.
