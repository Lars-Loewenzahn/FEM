Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,100
learning videos at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,980
Today's topic is 

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,540
Latin transitive verbs, which 

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,260
are intransitive in German. First of all, 

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,500
let me remind you that 

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,740
transitive verbs always have 

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,460
an accusative object. So if this is 

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,860
the case in Latin, it 

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,140
does not necessarily have to be the case 
in German, 

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,560
as we will learn today. 

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's start with some examples of 

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,680
such verbs. We have adäquare, 

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,500
gleichkommen, adjuvare, helfen, 

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,580
defikere, fehlen, sequi, folgen. 

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,480
As well as effugere, to flee from, 

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,180
ulkiski, to take revenge on, curare, to 

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,240
take care of and indignare, to be 

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,900
annoyed with. 

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,660
Let's look at 

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,400
a small example sentence for clarification 
. Liberi 

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,260
matrim adjuvant means in German, 

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
the children help. We ask, who are 

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,680
the children helping? And the answer 

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,140
is the mother. So we are asking 

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,400
for a dative object. In 

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,300
Latin, however, we have the 

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,820
accusative object, namely 

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,400
matrem, which is required by adjuvant 

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,680
. 

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,700
Impersonal transitive 

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,540
phrases also exist. There we would have 

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,480
me fugit, with es entgeht mir, me 

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,140
fallit, ich weiß nicht, nicht, es 

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,120
erfreut mich and es ziemt sich für 

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,260
mich. 

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,700
Other important phrases are es 

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,540
reut mich, ich schäme mich and ich 

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,760
bereue, es ekeligt mich. So you can 

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,100
also see that these impersonal 

41
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,040
expressions 

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,280
can be rendered personally in German. As 
with 

43
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,900
meh pudet, where we 

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,500
can turn the meh in German into the 
nominative 

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,120
with ich schäme mich. 

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,740
The person who feels something is in 

47
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,760

48
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,160
the accusative with these verbs of 
feeling, as 

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,880
the meh that you 

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,860
saw in the expressions also made clear. 

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,620

52
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,500
However, the thing to which the sensation 
then refers is in the 

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,760
genitive case . Let's take a look at a 

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,940
small example sentence. It 

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,280
reads stultitie me pudet. I am ashamed 

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,340
of my stupidity. Who is 

57
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,820
ashamed is written here with me and of 
whom 

58
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,140
one is ashamed is written in the genitive. 

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,840
Finally, some verbs 

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
of mood can be both 

61
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,980
intransitive and transitive 

62
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,720
, i.e. with an accusative object 

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,040
. 

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,620
On the one hand, this applies to 

65
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,360
Latin, where we would have 

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,920
desperare salutem or desperare 

67
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,820
desalute, which means to 

68
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,640
give up hope of salvation. On the other 
hand, we can also find 

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,740
the whole thing in German, 

70
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,890
namely sperare salutem, in which case 

71
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,610
we can render the whole thing as 

72
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,090
Rettung erhoffen or Aufrettung 

73
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,310
hoffen. Now we come to our 

74
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,470
summary. You have also 

75
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,890
learned that verbs 

76
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,670
can be transitive in Latin 

77
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,350
and are then 

78
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,670
rendered intransitively in German. 
Secondly, 

79
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,090
we 

80
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,710

81
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,610
looked at transitive and personal phrases, 
which you 

82
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,110

83
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,730
can also translate personally in German . 
Finally, we looked 

84
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,450
at some verbs of 

85
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,190
mood determination. 

86
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,190
Thank you for your attention and see you 

87
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,730
soon for a learning video at 

88
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,470
