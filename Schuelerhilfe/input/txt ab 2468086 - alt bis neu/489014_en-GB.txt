00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,750
Hello, I'm delighted that you've 

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,370
joined me again today. 

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,590
In this video, I would like to explain to 
you 

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,070
how to 

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,170
mirror a point on a plane . Because the 
whole thing 

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,590
is always a bit abstract, I've 

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,970
brought along an example. 

8
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,610
In my example, we have 

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,310
given the plane E and the point P. Our aim 

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,770
is to 

11
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,710
mirror the point P under the plane. I call 
this point 

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,770
P'. One way to achieve this goal 

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,650
is to create an auxiliary line 

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,110
and for this I need 

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,170
the normal vector of the plane 

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,390
and the point P on the one hand. 

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,210
I'll show you how this works with numbers 
using 

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,490
this example. We have given the plane 

19
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,450
E and the point P. It is important 

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,850
that the plane is 

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,510
given in the so-called coordinate 

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,090
form, because the 

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,130
normal vector of the 

24
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,990
plane is already contained in the 
coordinate form. We have 2, 2 and 

25
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,050
there is a 1 in front of the Z. This means 
that the 

26
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,570
normal vector of the plane is 2, 2, 

27
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,810
1. If I now want to 

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,770
create an auxiliary straight line , I take 
the 

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,760
point P as the position vector, because 

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,840
my straight line should start from there , 
plus 

31
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,570
S times the direction vector. and 

32
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,770
I take the 

33
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,390
normal vector of the plane as the 
direction vector , because it 

34
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,150
is very important that the straight line 

35
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,280
is perpendicular to the plane. So 2, 

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,600
2, 1. Now I want to find out 

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,300
how often I 

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,720
have to take the direction vector 

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,420
to arrive exactly at the plane. 

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,040
To do this, I insert each line 
individually into 

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,520
my plane. 

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,460
I enter the first line for the x, the 
second 

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,460
line for the x. and the third line 

44
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:17,100
for the z. So I 

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:24,440
now write 2 times the first line 4 plus 2s 

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,640
plus plus 2 times the second line of the 

47
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:35,120
straight line, 3 plus 2s, plus 1 time the 

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,260
last line of the straight line, i.e. 1 
plus 

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,460
1s, equals 33. 33 still comes 

50
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,620
from the plane. Now I resolve the 

51
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,060
brackets by 

52
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,900

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,340
multiplying each part before the bracket 
by each part in the bracket. This gives me 
15 

54
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:05,370
plus 9s equals 33. I calculate 

55
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,990
minus 15 on both sides and get 9s 

56
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,990
equals 18. I divide everything by 

57
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,910
9 and get s equals 2. For 

58
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,330
our example, this means the 

59
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,630
following. If I 

60
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,630
take the direction vector times 2, 

61
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,070
my straight line arrives exactly on 

62
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,350
my plane. But I 

63
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,790
don't want to land exactly on the plane, 

64
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,670
I want to travel the same distance 

65
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,290
behind the plane. So 

66
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,810
I have to 

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,750
add two more direction vectors . I 
therefore have to insert 4 into 

68
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,410
my equation of the line for S. 

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,480
My linear equation was 4, 

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,580
3, 1 for my point plus S and 

71
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,820
instead of S I now write 4 times the 

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,620
normal vector of the plane. The point 

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,760
I am calculating, i.e. P', is 12, 

74
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,400
11 and 5. 5. 

75
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,540
If you want to 

76
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,740
mirror a point on a plane, you have to 

77
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,020

78
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,580
build an auxiliary line from the point and 
the normal vector of the plane. 

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,660
Next, you determine how many 

80
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,640
times you have to take the direction 
vector 

81
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,840
to arrive directly at the plane. 

82
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,340
However, as we do not 

83
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,060
want to arrive at the plane, but 

84
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,400
want to pass through it and 

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,960
cover the same distance as to the plane 
again 

86
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,800
, you have to 

87
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,760
take this result times 2 and insert it 
into the straight line. 

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,080
The result is a mirrored 

89
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,100
point. Good luck and see you 

90
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,580
next time!
