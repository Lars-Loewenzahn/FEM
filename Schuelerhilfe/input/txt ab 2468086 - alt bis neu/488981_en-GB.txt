00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,480
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,720
This module is about the 

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,740
introduction in a 

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,000
scientific paper. 

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,710
We start with general 

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,790
information and then look at 

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,990
the structure and content. Here 

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,790
we cover the subtopics, the 

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,890
introduction of the topic, the aim of the 

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,450
paper, sources, methods, an 

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,410
overview of the structure of the paper 

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,330
and what you will not cover. 

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,210
Finally, there is a conclusion. 

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,120
General information 

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,400
What is the purpose of an introduction? 

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,120
First of all, it should give a concise 

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,840
impression of the topic. It 

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,780
should make it clear what the reader 

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,240
can expect on the following pages. 

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,140
It should also 

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,640
arouse the reader' s curiosity . The 
length depends 

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,680
on the time available and the overall 
scope 

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,480
of the academic paper. The 

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,340
introduction should make up about 10% of 
the 

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,480
total text. It makes 

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,940
sense to 

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,880
write the introduction only when the 
complete 

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,040
structure is already known. 

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,440
Structure and content. 

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,750
Let's start by 

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,650
introducing the topic. The topic 

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,330
should 

34
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,290
be placed in a larger context . Give an 
indication of the 

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,830
overarching significance or 

36
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,290
topicality of the topic. If the topic 

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,290
was not predetermined, but you 

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,510
chose the topic yourself 

39
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,710
, explain why you chose 

40
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,110
it. 

41
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,130
Also answer the question of why it is 

42
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,610
actually 

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,370
important to deal with the topic. 

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,860
Here are two examples of a 

45
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,480
boring and a gripping 

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,600
introduction. A boring introduction 

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
would be that this work deals with 

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,040
the architecture of Cologne Cathedral. A 

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,100
gripping introduction would be that 
Cologne 

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,640
Cathedral is one of the largest and 

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,180
most important cathedrals in the 

52
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,160
Gothic architectural style. 

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,730
Now let's look at the aim of the work 

54
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,150
. What do you want to 

55
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,490
achieve in the next few pages? What do you 
want to 

56
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,470
prove? Which positions or 

57
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,050
theses in the specialist literature do you 
want to 

58
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,970
critically question? 

59
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,950
Based on your goal, draft one or more 

60
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,050
key questions that you 

61
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,170
will answer in the main section. 
Attention! 

62
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,970
Make sure that your key questions 

63
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,590

64
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,150
can be answered within the scope of your 
paper. The topic should not be 

65
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,830
too broad, but also not too narrow 

66
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,470
. 

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,860
Here are some 

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
example formulations that you 

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,320
can use when it comes to the aim 

70
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,900
of the paper. The thesis has 

71
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,900
the following objectives. The main aim of 
the 

72
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,900
thesis is. The work clarifies. 

73
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,360
The thesis should explain 

74
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,280
how? This work should 

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,540
express that... 

76
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,430
Next, some notes on 

77
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,010
citing sources in the 

78
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,090
introduction. Give an insight into 

79
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,570
the most important literature you 

80
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,110
use. Do not 

81
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,590
simply list the individual books and 

82
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,570
articles, but refer to 

83
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,590
them. If necessary, quote 

84
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,190
key author statements for your topic. 

85
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,890
What do the respective contents achieve? 

86
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,030
To what extent have authors dealt 

87
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,810
with the topic so far ? 

88
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,350
Mentioning sources helps to 

89
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,870

90
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,630
present the current state of research. 

91
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,260
Here you can see some 

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,280
example formulations to make it clear 

93
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,820
how you 

94
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,620
can mention sources in an introduction. 

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,380
Caroline 

96
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,160
Meyer has recently dealt extensively with 
the question of how .... In her 

97
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,640
book published in 2008, she shows how. 

98
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:14,360
Meier 2008 The standard literature 

99
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,280
on the subject of ... is still the book 

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,960
by Gustav Schmidt, in which the author 

101
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,740
proved for the first time that ... 

102
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,980
Schmidt 1985 

103
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,480
 The 

104
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,080

105
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,600
article by Annalena Baulmann published in 
1993, in which 

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,500
the author ... Baulmann, 1993 

107
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,640
The research methods depend strongly 

108
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,220
on the subject in which the work 

109
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,860
is written. 

110
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,660
Literature studies are often 

111
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,540
carried out at school . Literature studies 

112
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,020
deal critically with a 

113
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
topic, 

114
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,200
using only published sources and not 

115
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,760
collecting their own data. 

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
You should always explain the 

117
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,380
methodology in the introduction. 

118
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,500
Possible empirical methods 

119
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,820
include experiments, observations, 

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,940
interviews or studies. Possible 

121
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,380
theoretical methods are, for 

122
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,920
example, the comparison of several 

123
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,140
research approaches or a 

124
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,910
deconstruction of ideas. 

125
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,430
Another important point in the 

126
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,230
introduction is the overview of the 

127
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,910
structure of the thesis. Explain how you 
are 

128
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,630
structuring your work. Give a 

129
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,370
rough overview of the structure of 

130
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,490
your argumentation. Show the reader 

131
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,290
the red phases that run through 

132
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,230
your paper. You can 

133
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,010
refer to your outline 

134
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,150
or table of contents. 

135
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,130
Outlining the structure is 

136
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,250
important so that the reader 

137
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,910
knows what to expect right from the start. 

138
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,760
Here are a few example formulations 

139
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,340
to 

140
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,260
explain the structure of a paper. First, 
it is described 

141
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,740
how, then, finally. 

142
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,000
Building on this in the first section of 
the paper, 

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,420
the second section 

144
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,840
concludes. This thesis is 

145
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
divided into so and so 

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,800
chapters. The first chapter 

147
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
explains how the second chapter 

148
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,800
is thematized. 

149
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,710
It makes sense to 

150
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,450
define in the introduction what is covered 
in the thesis 

151
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,550
and what is not. You 

152
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,230
can also explain what you are not 

153
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,310
addressing. Extensive and 

154
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,650
complex topics cannot be 

155
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,530
fully covered in one paper 

156
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,650
. Therefore, limit your topic. 

157
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,690
This way, you won't create 

158
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,690
false expectations for the reader. 
Basically 

159
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,330
, the narrower your topic, 

160
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,690
the easier it will be for you to 

161
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,490
work on it. 

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Here are a few 

163
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,680
examples of how to define 

164
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,540
your topic. The work 

165
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,260
concentrates 

166
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,240
on the topics. The question of how is not 

167
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,180
dealt with? I will 

168
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,560
not go into this below. A comprehensive 
treatment of 

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,380
this topic would 

170
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,000
go beyond the scope of this paper. 

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
You have now 

172
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,340
become familiar with all the important 
points that an introduction to 

173
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,540
a scientific paper 

174
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,220
should contain. 

175
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,340
However, the order of points 1 to 6 can 

176
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,600
be varied. 

177
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,600
Conclusion. In the introduction, you make 
the 

178
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
reader curious about the topic, 

179
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,840
introduce the topic of the paper 

180
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,820
, define the aim of your 

181
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,480
work, give a brief 

182
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,740
insight into the most important 

183
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,680
literature you use and 

184
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
the current state of research, 

185
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,220
explain the methods you 

186
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,680
use to achieve your goal, 

187
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,600
present the structure of your work
