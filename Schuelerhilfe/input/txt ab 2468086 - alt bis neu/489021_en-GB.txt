Hello, I'm delighted that you've 

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,580
joined me again today. 

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,900
In this video, I would like to explain to 
you how 

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,460
to convert proportions, i.e. fractions, 
into 

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,780
percentages. To 

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,120
explain the whole thing better, I have 

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,540
brought along a number of examples. I 

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,980
have a table here with four 

9
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,980
different fractions and it' 

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,020
s best to start with the fraction 1.5. 

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Step 1 is always the conversion to 

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,020
a decimal number. 1.5 corresponds to 0.5. 

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,980
Since percent means 100, 

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,020
we have to multiply 0.5 by 100 to 

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,300
get a percentage. 

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,460
Alternatively, you can 

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,060
remember to move the decimal point two 

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,500
places to the right. This 

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,780
then looks like this. We take 

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,760
the decimal point and move it one or two 

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,620
places to the right. The resulting number 

22
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,620
is 50 and that is 

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,680
also our percentage, i.e. 50%. 

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,440
We 

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,040
proceed in the same way for a third. One 
third corresponds to 0.333 

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,420
periods, whereby the period dash 

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,860
means that 

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,720

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,520
there are an infinite number of further 
threes after the last one. We move our 

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,060
decimal point two places to the right 
again , 1, 

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,260
2, and the resulting number 

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,660
is 33.3 periods per centimeter. 

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,240
We 

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,240
proceed in the same way for the 1 quarter. 
1 quarter corresponds to 0.25 and 

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,740
we move the decimal point two 

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,220
places 

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,420
to get our percentage of 25%. 

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,340

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
We 

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,880
proceed in the same way for an eighth, a 
much smaller fraction . One eighth 
corresponds to the 

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,880
decimal number 0.125 and after we 

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,140
have moved the decimal point, we 

43
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:07,060
get the percentage, namely 12.5%. 

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,860
A possible task at school could 

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,780
be to find out how many parts 

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,260
of the cake are marked as a percentage. 

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,520
Here we have a cake with eight 

48
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,600
pieces, so one piece equals. 1 

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,760
eighth and now want to know what 

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,800
percentage of the cake is marked in color 

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
. 

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,000
A total of three pieces are marked , i.e. 
3 times 1 

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,560
eighth. In our table, we have 

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,200
already calculated that 1 eighth 

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,200
corresponds to exactly 12.5 percent. We 

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,220
can therefore also write 3 times 12. 

57
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:55,160
5% and the result is 37.5%. 

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,860
So by converting 

59
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,540
proportions into percentages , we have 
determined that 

60
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,960
exactly 37.5% of our pie 

61
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,520
is color-coded . Thank you very much and 
see 

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,160
you next time.
