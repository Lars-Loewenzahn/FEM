00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,260
Welcome to IK7. In 

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,900
this sequence, I would like to 

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,600

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,440

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,660
introduce you to the new icons and 
functions of the request book. The request 
book is 

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,420
located in the Requests tile 

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,100
on your dashboard. You can 

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,140
open it using the three dots. Before you 

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,620
open it, you will already receive 

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,820
information on how many new, how 

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,100
many open and how many overdue 

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,160
requests it contains. 

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,920
At the same time, you get an 

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,900
overview of your conversion rate 

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,620
for the current month. When you open the 

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,060
request book, you will 

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,200
first see the small arrows that 

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,400
allow you 

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,020
to scroll to the previous month, but also 
to the following month. 

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,560
At the same level you will see a 

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,020
large plus sign, which indicates that 

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,140
you 

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,600
can enter new requests here. To help you, 

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,580
a small 

25
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,000
gray window opens under this symbol , 
which explains this 

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,900
function again. 

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,680
The entry is made in such a way that the 

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,360
current and new entries 

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,020
are always at the top, whereas the 

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,560
entries from the beginning of the month 

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,600
are at the bottom 

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,120
or even on page 2 or 3 

33
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,190
of the request form. We assume 

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,230
that these entries in the first 

35
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,570
and second of the month and 

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,810
subsequent days have of course already 

37
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,990
been completed and processed and that 

38
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,590
registrations 

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,610
have already been made here. It is 
therefore much more important to 

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,690

41
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,650
have an immediate overview of the new 
requests. This is why they are at the top 
of the list 

42
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:36,890
. 

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,210
In the lower section of the request book 
you will 

44
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,250
find the resubmission and a 

45
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,810
box and in an area of 

46
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,970
overdue requests. The 

47
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,730
resubmission is always actively 

48
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,030
determined and populated by us. 

49
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,790
This means that the appointments that I 

50
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,290
select as the next action will appear here 

51
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,330
in the resubmission. In 

52
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,450
the overdue requests, the box 

53
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,530
serves more as a reminder. In the 

54
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,330
event that we 

55
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,250
overlook something, for example, or 

56
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,690
a deadline has passed. All 

57
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,450
appointments and requests that 

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,050
have not been processed for more than two 
days 

59
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,530
automatically slide into the 

60
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,750
overdue requests and 

61
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,110
remind you that a new action 

62
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,990
is required here. 

63
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,440
The individual columns are made up as 

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,980
follows. 

65
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,140
You will find the date here , you 

66
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,860
will also find the details of the 

67
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,860
student acceptance and first name here and 
you will 

68
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,060
find the details of the interested party. 

69
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,680
You will also find the name here. 

70
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,540
If the names are not the same, it is 

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,500
of course much, much easier to 

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,480

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,180
assign the interested party to the 
student. Both entries, both 

74
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,440
those of the student and the 

75
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,340
interested party, can also be found in the 

76
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,440
Contacts area. In the 

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,060
next column you will find the 

78
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,480
entry for the class and the type of school 

79
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,780
and we can then 

80
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,140
enter the subjects. 

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,120

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,540
You can 

83
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,740
enter up to three different subjects in 
the list of subjects. In the 

84
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,520
Notes column, as shown here 

85
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,120
as an example, we can 

86
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,840
enter the Office label. 

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,700
As soon as we 

88
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,640
call up this office identification , a 
printer symbol will 

89
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,320
open . 

90
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,540
The pre-registration is then located 
behind this printer symbol . 

91
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,560

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,560
The status of the request is named in the 
Status area of the request book. 

93
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,040
This means that we differentiate here 

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,140
between registrations, open 

95
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,000
contacts, new contacts and 

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,520
closed contacts. 

97
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,020
Next to this you will see the signature 

98
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,460
of the person who last 

99
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,340
edited this contact. The 

100
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,400
penultimate column gives you the 

101
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,260
option of printing things out, 

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,640
either an offer or, as 

103
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,480
already mentioned, the pre-registration. 
And 

104
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,200
last but not least, the last symbol 

105
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,640
is called Close. This means 

106
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,060
that you can 

107
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,940

108
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,960
close requests that cannot be converted 
successfully. 

109
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,920
Another new symbol I would like to 

110
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,980

111
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,480
show here is this little drop with 

112
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,620
the little man in it . This is our 

113
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,580
new symbol for the trial student. 

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,340
These 

115
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,580
were the new symbols for 

116
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,580
the inquiry book. In the next sequence, 

117
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,040
I would like to 

118
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,620
go into the status with you and see how 
the 

119
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,220
status 

120
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,260
can be edited by the individual students 
or requests.
