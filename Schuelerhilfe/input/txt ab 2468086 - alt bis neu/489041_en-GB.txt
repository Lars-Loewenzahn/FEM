00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,430
Hello, welcome to 

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,610
another learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,790
Today I would like to 

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,930
take a look at the elegiac distich with 
you . 

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,810
The elegiac distich is also a 

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,090
very common verse meter 

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,750
used in Latin poetry. 

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,530
The elegiac distich 

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:27,670
consists of a dactylic hexameter. 

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,130
You are welcome to watch our videos on 
this 

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,090
. works again, 

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,610
is built up again and a 

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,410
dactylic pentameter. I have 

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,910
briefly 

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,630
shown you a diagram of how a 

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,830
dactylic hexameter is structured. 

17
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,950
You can see the six feet of verse. 

18
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,630
I have also marked 

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,750
the possible caesuras in yellow. 

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,450
Yes, and this hexameter 

21
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,330
is then followed by the pentameter. 

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,370
Let's take a look. The pentameter, penta 
is 

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,530
Greek and means 5, so 

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,430
theoretically it should consist of 5 
dactyls. 

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,670
That's about right. 

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,910
However, the special feature is that it 
consists 

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,330
of 2 times 2.5 dactyls. And 

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,070
why do I emphasize 

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,930
these 2 times 2.5? 

30
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,870
We have a look at the diagram here. 

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,890
We have the first half of the pentameter 
here 

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,690
and you can see that we first have two 

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,910
dactyls, where we 

34
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,750

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,370

36
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,720
can replace the double shortness, as in 
the hexameter , with a spondee, i.e. with 
a length. 

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,620
But then the third dactyl breaks off 

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,240
after the emphasized length. That is the 

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,480
first, yes. Two and a half parts and then 

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,160
we start again with two new 

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,300
fresh dactyls. Attention, you 

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,820
see, in this back part of the 

43
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,040
pentameter you must 

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,960
not replace the double shortening with 
lengths. And 

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,860
finally, there remains a syllaba 

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,900
an Ketz, which can be either long or short 

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,680
, but is always accented. 

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,660

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,200
The special feature of the pentameter 

50
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,020
is that although it 

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,040
is called pentameter, 5 meters , it has 6 
stresses, which is because 

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,340

53
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,020
it is broken off after the stressed length 
and 

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,800
then restarted. You 

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
may be wondering about 

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
these two dashes here. 

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,880
So these two strokes are a caesura. 

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,060
The caesura, the incision that marks 
exactly 

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,700
these two halves of the mentameter 

60
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,340
. And as a rule, 

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,240
of course, you also have a word boundary 
here. 

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,040
However, there are exceptions, but 

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,300
let's take a look at 

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,700
a small example. 

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,560
Let's take a look at the following 

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,280
epigram, which is an elegiac 

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,180
destichon. 

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,100
I've already 

69
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,880
read it to you with the accents. Let's 
mark 

70
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,200
briefly, let's chant our 

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,820
hexameter briefly . So here we have a 

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,400
length, a short, a short, a 

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,020
length. TN forms positional length, GR 

74
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,840
again a length, accusative plural 

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,960
is always long. Then we have 

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,240
an accusative plural here , which has to 

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,900
be long and the two I and E are 

78
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,300
short. Short, zack, Lekania, a 

79
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,360
diphthong, is inherently long. 

80
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,720
So we have 

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,500
found the first four feet of verse. And 
then we have 

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,800
the length here again. Two short ones, 

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,200
in the fifth verse foot there is 

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,340
never a length in hexameter. And 

85
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,080
finally our last verse foot 

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,740
, which is so two-syllabic, first 

87
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,420

88
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,190
fights the stressed length and our syllaba 
. Now let's look at 

89
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,650
the pentameter, which is actually the 

90
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,620
new thing for you. 

91
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,520
First we have the word quä, which is 

92
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,210
of course long. So, and what we 

93
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,950
notice, we have to be careful, we 

94
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,970
have O and E here, which 

95
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,430
clash. Normally 

96
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,570
you'd think, oh yes, an 

97
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,470
illusion, so get rid of the O. No, 

98
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,850
watch out, the second word is Est, 

99
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,610
then the case of apheresis occurs. 

100
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,530
If you can't remember what that 

101
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,510
is, just watch the video 

102
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,350
again. In this 

103
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,370
case, the E is simply dropped. So, 

104
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,170
is there another caesura 

105
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,950
we need to look out for ? Or a 

106
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,390
hiatus? Sorry, I didn't 

107
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,570
promise. A hiatus 

108
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,970
that we need to watch out for? No. So, 

109
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,550
let's keep chanting. We 

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,710
have the O, which is long because of the 

111
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,910
following Sts. We have the E, which 

112
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,830
is long, because of MPT. We have an 

113
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,050
accusative plural ending that 

114
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,570
is always long in masculine-feminine. We 
have 

115
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,130
HÄG, a word with a diphthong, must 

116
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,930
be long. Here we have I, a 

117
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,110
positional length, because of the double 

118
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,890
L. Here we have in pentameter, it 

119
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,450
has the last syllable on, K, it would be 

120
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,130
long here. Zack, and the beautiful leg. 

121
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,750
The last part is actually always 

122
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,750
clearly defined. You have 

123
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,070
two pure dactyls, we know A and 

124
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,830
U are short, and 

125
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,930
a syllaba attached. This means that we 
have 

126
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,210
already 

127
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,690
found the emphasized length after which 
the caesura, which I 

128
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,110
have just entered here, 

129
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,770
comes. Since there is a length in front of 
it, 

130
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,250
this is the stressed length. and so 

131
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,890
we know that A and I are 

132
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,830
two shortenings, a dactilus. 

133
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,030
Let's take another quick look at what this 

134
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,750
means. Thais has black 

135
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,030
teeth , Lecania has white teeth. What's 
the reason? Well, 

136
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,830
this hack, hack 

137
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,830
refers to Lecania here, by the way, Anja 
has 

138
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,650
bought, meaning teeth, Ella has the one 

139
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,350
that is further away, the one that 

140
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,450
was mentioned before , so Thais, still 

141
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,450
her own. A funny little 

142
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,210
poem and the nice thing is 

143
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,730
that we can see here that 

144
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,570
dentures already existed in ancient Rome. 
I hope 

145
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,610
you enjoy this video. See 

146
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,690
you soon. See you soon. Thank you very 
much.
