1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Die Feindin Marilyn Monroe war eine

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,040
berühmte Schauspielerin, Sängerin und

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,160
Modellin. Sie wurde in Los Angeles

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,780
geboren, ein Staat in Kalifornien, in

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,200
den USA, 1926. Ihr echter Name war

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,040
Norma Jean Mortensen. Normas Kindheit

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,940
war sehr schwierig. Seine Mutter

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,520
Gladys hatte eine mentale Krankheit

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,740
und konnte nicht ihre Tochter

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,560
kümmern. Sein Vater Charles verlor

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,980
Gladys, als sie krank wurde.

12
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,640
Therefore Norma was placed with

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,300
foster parents and spent her

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,560
childhood in and out of foster home

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
until she turned 16. At this age she

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,960
married the man James Doherty, who

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,700
was a friend of hers and lived close

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,720
by. When James joined the military,

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,820
Norma started working as a model. In

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,260
1945 she signed in with the agency

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,800
Blue Book Model and colored her hair

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,380
blonde. Von diesem Moment an begann

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,420
sie in verschiedenen Magazinen und

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,380
Covers zu erscheinen. Sie hat die

25
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,200
Geld, die sie mit ihrem Job verdient

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,480
hat, auf Bücher, Literaturkursen und

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,240
auf einem Aktivismuskurs gespart.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
Während dieses Kurses hat sie Ben

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
Lyon getroffen, der ihr einen

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
Kontrakt als Aktressin erhielt. Das

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,020
war der Zeitpunkt, als Norma ihren

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,160
Namen in den Stagenamen Marilyn

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,080
Monroe verändert hat. 1947 divorced

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,340
she James and started working as an

35
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,180
actress full time. From this moment

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,160
on she was seen in different roles in

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,560
multiple films and became a famous

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,400
star. Marilyn was a very attractive

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,540
woman and for this reason she got a

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,080
lot of attention from men. The most

41
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,200
iconic photo of Marilyn is her

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,240
standing over a sidewalk with her

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,060
skirt blowing up. Because she was

44
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,060
tired of dumb blonde roles and

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,220
looking for more dramatic roles, she

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,180
moved to New York. There she found a

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,060
new director and finally got serious

48
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,140
roles. In 1956 she met Arthur Miller,

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,100
who turned out to be the love of her

50
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,580
life. They got married the same year

51
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,440
at a small wedding. Finally, Marilyn

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,140
found the happiness she was looking

53
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,320
for since her childhood.

54
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,120
Unfortunately, it turned out that

55
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,820
Arthur was not as happy with the

56
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,940
marriage and Marilyn was heartbroken.

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,800
They kept the marriage together but

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Marilyn started psychotherapy and

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,380
began taking sleeping pills and

60
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,020
drinking alcohol to sleep. She was

61
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,860
not able to focus on her career

62
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,100
anymore and was fired from several

63
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,420
projects because she was always late

64
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,180
and difficult to work with. When

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,660
Arthur fell in love with another

66
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,400
woman, they got divorced. In May

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,100
1962, drei Monate bevor sie gestorben

68
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
war, sang sie Happy Birthday to

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
President John F. Kennedy at a

70
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
Democratic Fundraiser at the Madison

71
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,080
Square Garden. This performance was

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,840
one of her last. On August 5, 1962,

73
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,160
she was discovered in her home with

74
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,700
an overdose of sleeping pills. The

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,860
circumstances of her death are still

76
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,220
unclear.
