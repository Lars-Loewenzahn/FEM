Hallo, mein Name ist Lisa aus

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,940
Großbritannien. Ich bin 15 Jahre alt

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,760
und sehr interessiert in Sport. Mein

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,540
Lieblingssport ist Cricket, der sehr

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,460
populär ist im UK, aber auch in

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,940
Indien. Cricket ist ein Spiel mit

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,300
zwei Gruppen, den Beatern und den

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,160
Bowlern. Es sind 11 Spieler in jedem

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,360
Team. Manchmal sind es auch 12

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,040
Spieler. Wenn jemand getötet wird

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,780
während des Spiels, er oder sie.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,320
could substitute the injured. One

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,720
inning, this is what a round of

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,440
cricket is called, is one hour and

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,940
fifteen minutes long. In this time,

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,160
the goal is nearly the same as in

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,180
baseball. A player of the beaters is

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,180
called batter. He or she has to beat

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,960
the ball and one of his or hers other

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,540
teammates has to run to the wicket of

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,180
the fielding team and back again to

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,140
score one point for his team. The

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,240
bowlers must try to get the batter

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,100
before his teammate has the

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,180
opportunity to run. The goal for them

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,020
is to catch the ball before the

27
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,000
batter arrives from the wicket. If

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the fielding team can catch the ball,

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,300
the batter is out and has to be

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,380
substituted by one of his teammates.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,600
After 1 hour and 15 minutes, the

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,440
teams switch their positions. The

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,480
batter team becomes the bowler team

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,260
and The winner is the team which

35
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,680
scored the most runs in. My favorite

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,700
position in the game is the batter

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,780
position. I am very good at it and my

38
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,660
team wins very often. Maybe you would

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,760
like to try it as well.
