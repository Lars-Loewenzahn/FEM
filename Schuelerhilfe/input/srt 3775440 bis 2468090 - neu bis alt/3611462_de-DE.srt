00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
The Outback in Australia is a huge

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,160
region, which covers most of

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,140
Australia. It's made up of 10 deserts

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,820
and also subtropical savannah and the

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,740
largest temperate woodland on earth.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's start our little Outback tour

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,540
with Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,220
It's a large sandstone rock, higher

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,340
than the Eiffel Tower. It's 348

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,560
meters tall. Uluru is one of

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,980
Australia's most recognizable

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,620
natural... Landmarks and has been a

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,700
tourist attraction since 1930. In the

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,660
Outback you can drive on the world's

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,540
longest straight road. It's 146.6

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,240
kilometers long without a bend.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,940
There's also the world's longest

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,980
fence, which was built in 1885. It's

19
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,540
5,614 kilometers long. Only the Great

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,860
Wall of China is longer. Most people

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,400
think that the Outback Outback is a

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,820
dry desert, but it rains a lot there.

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,060
Some years there is no rain, but in

24
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,420
others there are floods. The

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,200
temperatures in the central deserts

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,400
can easily reach 50 degrees in the

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,220
summer. In winter it's very cold,

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,140
with minus 10 degrees. One of the

29
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,160
most seen animals in the Outback is

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,340
the camel. There are over one million

31
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,940
roaming Australia. It's the largest

32
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,000
number of purebred camels in the

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,900
world. Der Outback hat viele

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,400
verschiedene Namen. Zum Beispiel der

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,820
Never Never und der Back of Beyond.

36
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,720
Es ist 5,3 Millionen Quadratkilometer

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,740
groß und fast 22-mal größer als die

38
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,000
UK. Und der Outback ist einer der

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
besten Plätze im Weltraum für

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,700
Stargazing.
