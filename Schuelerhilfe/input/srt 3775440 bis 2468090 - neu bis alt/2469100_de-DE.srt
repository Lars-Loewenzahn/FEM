00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,650
Name ist Elena und ich werde heute

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,230
mit euch das Webinar machen. Ja,

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,170
Genau, ich werde jetzt gleich als

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,170
allererstes einmal mit euch, also die

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,710
Folien euch vorstellen, generell über

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,130
das Thema sprechen. Zwischendurch

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,330
wird es ein paar kleine Aufgaben

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,350
geben und am Ende beantworte ich auch

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,230
gerne noch. nochmal fragen. Ihr könnt

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,290
natürlich zwischendurch auch schon

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,230
Fragen stellen oder auch am Ende, da

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,490
kann ich euch, also da fordere ich

17
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,090
euch direkt nochmal auf, Fragen zu

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,950
stellen. Ich kann auch gerne immer

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,170
noch, wenn ich am Ende bin, ein paar

20
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,930
Folien zurückgehen, wie ihr möchtet.

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,770
Also wenn irgendwas unklar ist, sagt

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,590
Bescheid. Ich gehe dann gerne nochmal

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,070
zurück, erkläre gerne nochmal auf

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,250
eine andere Art und Weise, wenn ihr

25
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,270
was noch noch nicht verstanden habt.

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,710
Sagt nur Bescheid. Gut. Ich hoffe,

27
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,970
ihr könnt mich alle gut verstehen.

28
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,810
Und genau. Also, wenn irgendwas ist,

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,610
schreibt gerne in die Chatbox. Ja,

30
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,170
dann werde ich darauf aufmerksam und

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,630
kann es, wie gesagt, nochmal anders

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,130
erklären. So. Ich werde das Webinar,

33
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,530
also es ist, die Texte, die werden

34
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,490
auf Englisch sein. Wenn ihr möchtet,

35
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,670
kann ich das Webinar auf Englisch

36
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,330
halten. Ich kann es aber auch auf

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,830
Deutsch halten, wie ihr mögt. Sagt

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,250
einmal Bescheid, auf welcher Sprache

39
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,810
ihr das gerne hören möchtet. Auf

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,570
Englisch, okay, gut. Okay, so let's

41
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,470
start. If you don't understand my

42
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,230
English very well, if I should

43
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,130
explain something in a different way

44
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,930
or in German, please tell me. I would

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,610
love to explain something in German

46
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,010
to you if you don't understand my

47
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,870
English. Okay, Component.

48
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,350
So, I'm going to read that out first

49
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,510
and then I'm going to explain it in

50
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,910
my own words. In order to analyze a

51
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,570
fictional text, you need knowledge of

52
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,170
the fundamental components that a

53
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,190
fictional text contains. These

54
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,850
elements are used by the author to

55
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,950
create his own fictional word where

56
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,090
the story takes place. They are not

57
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,110
always obvious, therefore they need

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,810
to be analyzed in detail. Important

59
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,930
elements are Setting and Atmosphere,

60
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,830
Characters and the Plot. Okay, here I

61
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,770
just, there's nothing I can like add.

62
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,650
So the most important things of

63
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,990
fictional text are like the setting,

64
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,090
so where does take place the

65
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,570
atmosphere, like how are the persons

66
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,290
feeling or is it like dark or how's

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,570
the atmosphere, like in general, the

68
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,850
characters and the plot, like what's

69
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,610
happening. Yeah.

70
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,270
So, Setting and Atmosphere, let's

71
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,050
explore that. Setting. The setting

72
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,970
used in a fictional text describes

73
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,210
time as well as the geographic

74
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,730
location. It answers the question of

75
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,350
where and when. The setting can

76
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,810
influence the character's behavior.

77
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,190
It helps to initiate the mood for a

78
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,750
story. So, like, the setting is

79
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,390
important. Like, it's not only where

80
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,250
it does take place, but when. So,

81
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,050
also the time. It's also important,

82
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,470
like, this also contains... Setting.

83
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,070
Setting can influence the character's

84
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,630
behavior, so it's a very important

85
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,190
fact. And it also is important, the

86
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,430
setting can also affect the mood, the

87
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,650
mood of a story, the mood of certain

88
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,310
persons in a story. So it's also

89
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,650
important. Important questions

90
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,670
referring to the setting are which

91
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,470
year or period does the narration

92
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,970
take place in? Which season is it?

93
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,490
Like, I don't know, autumn, spring,

94
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,190
whatever. What time of the day is it?

95
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,150
Is it like noon? Is it like...

96
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,000
Because the weather is also important

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,900
as if it's raining or if the sun is

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,800
coming out, whatever. It also affects

99
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,120
the setting as maybe there may be

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,240
sunshine or rain and it may be dark.

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,600
So the setting can change. if the

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,680
weather changes. How can the social

103
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,260
environment be described? Like the

104
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,240
social relation between the

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,620
characters, for example. Whatever.

106
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,160
Atmosphere. The atmosphere of a story

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,380
describes the mood, emotions and

108
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,480
feelings. It is a literary technique

109
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,260
that can provide the reader with a

110
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,300
type of feelings that he gets while

111
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,500
reading the narrative. The atmosphere

112
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,280
can change throughout the story,

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
especially when there is a change of

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,760
setting. As the setting contributes,

115
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,080
So, first, the atmosphere of a story

116
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,140
contains three main things. The mood

117
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,740
of certain persons, it's unique. The

118
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,760
emotions and feelings. So, then

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,960
there's also the fact that the

120
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,640
atmosphere can change. So, it's not

121
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,920
static. So, when the story begins and

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,740
when the story ends, the mood, the

123
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,040
atmosphere doesn't have to be the

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,620
same, so it can be different. The

125
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,400
main purpose of creating a particular

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,440
atmosphere in a story is to establish

127
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,240
an emotional effect. Very important.

128
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,780
Therefore, the reader tends to stay

129
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,820
interested in the story as it appears

130
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,660
to be more lively and exciting. So,

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,600
yeah, the atmosphere is used to

132
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,380
create a certain tension, Spannung,

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,280
in the story. So it's very important

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,060
that the atmosphere is well

135
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,980
described, so the story gets more

136
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,200
lively and exciting for the reader to

137
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,060
read. The place where a story takes

138
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
place can indicate the spiritual

139
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,000
condition of a character, where

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,880
elements like nature, weather, colors

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,660
and shapes have an influence on the

142
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,520
mood. Ja, also die Setting, wie ich

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,920
es vorhin beschrieben habe, hat einen

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
Effekt auf die Bedingungen eines

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
Charakters, wie ist der Charakter,

146
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,880
wie ist er bekannt, oder ist der

147
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,840
Charakter in einem guten Mood oder so

148
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,080
etwas. Aber die Elemente wie Natur,

149
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,680
Wetter, Farben und Formen, sie

150
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,100
beeinflussen den Mood, wie fühlen die

151
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Menschen zum Beispiel, wie ist die

152
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,320
Geschichte vermittelt. example so

153
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,680
dies vor allem ins half ein flüssiges

154
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
modus world fast

155
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,500
so passend aus konzernen setting and

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,260
atmosphere can be so hier auf die

157
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,320
possible task you may see in your

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,760
exam oh yeah in it they could be in

159
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,800
every exam yeah in every oral exam

160
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,460
whatever heißt die atmosphäre in der

161
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,100
text kreis

162
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:31,920
Wie wurde der

163
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Autor erschaffen? Erklär deine

164
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,040
Meinung mit Beweis vom Text. Also

165
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,500
alle Punkte, die wir, wie ich es

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,780
vorher beschrieben habe, sind wichtig

167
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,320
für diese, um diese Fragen zu

168
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,880
beantworten. Also, die Atmosphäre und

169
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,260
die Atmosphäre sind nicht, sie sind

170
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,000
nicht, sie enthalten nicht nur einen

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
Fakt. Sie sind sehr, wie große

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,400
Fakten, also sie enthalten, zum

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,160
Beispiel, Farbe, wie die Wetter, was

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
auch immer, ich habe es bereits

175
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,500
vorhin erklärt, but they are very

176
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,040
important for a story. So if you get

177
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,540
asked, for example, how is the

178
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,260
atmosphere in the text created by the

179
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,840
author? You can say, for example,

180
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,040
yeah, the weather is good, the

181
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
weather is bad, whatever. You can

182
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,380
describe it if the sun shines, if

183
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,540
it's raining, if there's a

184
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,320
thunderstorm. What time of the day is

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,360
it? For example, you can describe all

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
these facts to describe better in

187
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,360
detail, to get more points, for

188
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,260
example. Wenn du es in Detail

189
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,740
beschreibst, ist das besser für deine

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,960
Grätsch. Phrasen. Mögliche Phrasen,

191
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,100
die du benutzen kannst. Setting. Die

192
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,580
Geschichte nimmt Platz in. Die

193
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,000
Geschichte nimmt Platz in der Zeit,

194
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,140
zum Beispiel in der Zeit der

195
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,980
Zweiten Weltkrieg. Zum Beispiel. Die

196
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,720
Weise, in der die Aktion ist.

197
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,060
Ein bisschen... ...was auch immer.

198
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,640
Die Aktion schafft sich von...

199
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,980
...zu... So all these phrases are so

200
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
-called useful phrases you can use in

201
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,120
your exam to start the description of

202
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,700
the setting. Atmosphere. Useful

203
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,640
phrases for the atmosphere. The fact

204
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,340
that creates a warm or friendly,

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,100
cold, happy, sinister, frozen,

206
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,220
hostile atmosphere. There is a change

207
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,920
of atmosphere when, for example, when

208
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,440
the king enters. The atmosphere is

209
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,420
charged with anger. The friendly,

210
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,900
warm, cold, whatever, atmosphere has

211
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,280
an impact on. So these are useful

212
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,480
phrases to describe the atmosphere.

213
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Exercise, so first exercise. Please

214
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,480
read the text. I will read it out

215
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
loud. Scene 1, so it's from Sam

216
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
Shepard, True West. Scene 1, night,

217
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,820
sound of crickets and dark.

218
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,940
Candlelight appears in alcove.

219
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,220
So, the question

220
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,260
for you is, how does the setting

221
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,760
contribute to the mood of scene one?

222
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,140
So, please write in the chat box,

223
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,980
like, what is your opinion? Please

224
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,080
answer or try. um die Frage zu

225
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,920
beantworten. Nenne einfach nur ein

226
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,740
oder zwei Aspekte. Ich brauche nicht

227
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,960
die volle Runde. Nur ein oder zwei

228
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,320
Gedanken, die genügend sind.

229
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Vielleicht haben Sie einige dieser

230
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,680
Ideen. Ich warte auf Antworten. Zum

231
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,180
Beispiel,

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,360
schau, wie die Beschreibung

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,520
geschrieben wird. Ist es friedlich?

234
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,300
Ist es verletzbar? ist es? Ich weiß

235
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,610
es nicht. Lest es und vielleicht habt

236
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,110
ihr eine Idee.

237
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,670
Also, ich habe eine Antwort bekommen.

238
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,650
Moonlight bedeutet friedlich. Das ist

239
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,270
richtig. Also, ich denke, ich würde

240
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,530
die Exzertion

241
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,170
beenden, dass es sehr friedlich ist

242
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,810
und die Atmosphäre so ein schönes und

243
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,750
friedliches Es ist ein sehr ruhiges

244
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,970
Setting, wie ein Handtuch, ein

245
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,130
Zigarettenstrahl. Es ist so, als

246
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,510
wären sie in keinem Ruck. Sie haben

247
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,370
Zeit, sie sind kalt. Ein Kabelstuhl,

248
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,470
das auf dem Tisch bricht. Das ist

249
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,290
auch ein bisschen romantisch. Es ist

250
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,750
also eine sehr ruhige Atmosphäre, in

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,670
der man sich gut fühlen kann.

252
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,990
Wenn man die Description nicht lesen

253
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,650
kann, You get maybe a different sense

254
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,970
of what they are saying here in the

255
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,630
dialogue. So the description is very

256
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,270
good for analysing or for getting a

257
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,730
look how the atmosphere is. If here

258
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,090
would be a different, for example, a

259
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,510
different description, we would get a

260
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,990
different sense of how this dialogue

261
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,510
may be. Also wenn hier zum Beispiel,

262
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,870
ich weiß nicht, Frieden und sehr

263
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,010
laute Geräusche wären, dann wäre das

264
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,230
nicht so friedlich. Also wir würden

265
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,470
einen Sinn bekommen, oh, das ist

266
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,590
nicht friedlich, was ist da los? Aber

267
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,150
jetzt mit dieser Beschreibung können

268
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,650
wir sehen, dass es eine friedliche

269
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,950
Situation ist. Ja, also ein nächstes

270
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,190
Übungsgerät, ein weiteres

271
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,490
Übungsgerät. Es ist auch, wie der

272
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,490
Veränderung der Setting den Mund und

273
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,070
Atmosphäre beeinflusst. Schaut

274
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,790
einfach den Text. Ich werde es alle

275
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,710
auslesen, wie ich es vorher gemacht

276
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,630
habe. Und nur ein oder zwei Antworten

277
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,430
sind genügend. Also, Szene 9. Mit,

278
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,570
okay, es ist von George Bernard Shaw.

279
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,650
Püpp, Marlion. Szene 9. Mit

280
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,890
Dinosaurier, blazend, die Stage ist

281
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,330
überwacht. Bottle's Toast is smashed,

282
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,390
typewriter, ripped out, telephone,

283
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,110
etc. All the debris from previous

284
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,250
scene is now starkly visible in

285
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,210
intense yellow light. The effect

286
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,690
should be like a desert junkyard at

287
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,450
high noon. The coolness of the

288
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,130
preceding scene is totally

289
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,950
obliterated. Austin is seated, a

290
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,650
table in a coffin, shirt open,

291
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,630
pouring with sweat. Hunched over a

292
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,990
writing note. ...

293
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,990
...

294
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,250
So, how does the change of setting

295
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,410
affect the mood and atmosphere? So,

296
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,670
we read the first excerpt and now we

297
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,150
have the second excerpt. Like, how is

298
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,210
the change transmitted? Can you tell

299
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,210
me how is the change of setting

300
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,210
affect the mood and atmosphere? Tell

301
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,810
me. So, write in the chat box maybe.

302
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,370
So.

303
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,690
That's right. So in the first excerpt

304
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,870
they're very relaxed and calm and

305
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,830
everything was peaceful. But now the

306
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,030
change of the setting, like they are

307
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,730
not running, but they are going

308
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,990
somewhere. And everything is very

309
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,150
stressful and it's very uncomfortable

310
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,890
because they're sweating. And here

311
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,110
it's a blazing heat, so it's very,

312
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,450
very hot. And smashed typewriter, a

313
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,010
ripped out telephone, so something is

314
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,410
broken as well. So there's a very

315
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,090
abrupt... Change of settings, change

316
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,610
of mood and atmosphere as well. So

317
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,990
yeah, it's very uncomfortable, the

318
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,770
mood and the atmosphere. Like you

319
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,330
don't feel very good in the setting.

320
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,440
Characters. The characters are a

321
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,820
significant element of every literary

322
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,660
text. With their decisions, dialogue

323
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,920
and action, they determine the course

324
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
of action. A character has the

325
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,020
following characteristics. Behavior,

326
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,040
emotions and things. Diese drei

327
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,620
Komponenten sind für Charaktere sehr

328
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,980
üblich. Es ist also wichtig, wenn du

329
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,760
einen Analyse machst, diese drei

330
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,000
Charakteristiken

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,640
zu behandeln. Also Verhalten,

332
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,520
Emotionen und Denken. Also, explizite

333
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,300
Charakterisation, also in mehr

334
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,020
Detail. The narrator or another

335
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,720
character describes the character

336
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,860
directly. Therefore following

337
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,360
characteristics are described to the

338
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
reader. Outward experience,

339
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,160
appearance, habits, behavior,

340
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,820
attitudes and opinions. So that's an

341
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,100
explicit characterization. So it's in

342
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,520
more detail. The reader gets like

343
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,800
more of what the character looks

344
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,840
like, how the character looks like.

345
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,800
So it gets more details about the

346
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,600
character. Then there is also, so we

347
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,880
have the explicit characterization

348
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,020
and we have the implicit

349
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,500
characterization. The character is

350
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
introduced indirectly. The reader has

351
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,960
to analyze given information in order

352
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
to define the characteristics of the

353
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,180
character. Information that might be

354
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,400
relevant are thought process,

355
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,600
behavior, speech, way of talking,

356
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,900
appearance, communication with other

357
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,360
characters.

358
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,540
Es ist einfach so, dass der Charakter

359
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,040
indirekt vorgestellt wird. In dem

360
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,940
Buch ist es nicht geschrieben. Ja,

361
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,860
Mr. Johnson hat dunkle Haare, hat

362
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,960
blaue Augen, ist sehr freundlich.

363
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,220
Aber wenn man die Geschichte lesen

364
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,740
kann, bekommt man eine Verständnis

365
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,120
dafür, wie der Charakter sich verhält

366
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,040
oder wie er aussieht. Aber einfach

367
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
unbequem. Es wird also nicht

368
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,800
geschrieben, ah, Mr. Johnson ist so

369
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,240
und so, aber es ist implizit. Man

370
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
bekommt einen impliziten Sinn, wie

371
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,460
der Charakter aussieht oder wie der

372
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,920
Charakter fühlt, was auch immer.

373
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,080
Konstellation von Charakteren. Die

374
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
Konstellation von Charakteren

375
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,540
beschreibt die Beziehung zwischen

376
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,200
Charakteren aus einem literären Text.

377
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,540
We can categorize characters into

378
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,060
groups if some people always stick up

379
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,700
for each other or if we can identify

380
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,120
a leader, a role model.

381
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,410
Every time you describe a character,

382
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,250
they are in a group. So if they stick

383
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,490
in this group. Or we can identify a

384
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,990
leader. So the person who is leading

385
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,610
everything, a role model. Also

386
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,570
possible. Therefore it is important

387
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,690
to consider the relationship.

388
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,770
zwischen den individuellen

389
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,350
Charakteren.

390
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,670
Die Beziehung zwischen den

391
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,890
Charakteren ist wichtig, um die

392
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,130
Verzweiflung von Charakteren zu

393
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,630
bekommen, wie sind die Charaktere mit

394
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,010
einander? Sind sie gute Freunde oder

395
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,210
sind sie mehr als Freunde? Oder sind

396
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,850
sie Feinde? Die Beziehung ist also

397
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,990
sehr wichtig für diese Faktoren. Um

398
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,170
auf die Attitüde zu reflektieren, If

399
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,790
the characters have towards another

400
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,430
character, we can use the following

401
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,430
terms. Affection, dislike,

402
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,410
friendship, rivalry, peaceful

403
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,950
relationship, tense relationship,

404
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,590
distant relationship. Distant

405
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,650
relationship. That's not right here.

406
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,770
It's like this relationship, a very

407
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,110
close relationship. Needs to sound

408
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,830
here. Loyalty and hostility. So these

409
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,530
are like...

410
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,250
different words, how you can describe

411
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,470
a relation, for example.

412
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,680
Development of a character. So,

413
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,380
there's a gradual development. The

414
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,200
development of a character depends on

415
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,520
many factors. It happens in more than

416
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,840
one phase. Then there's the abrupt

417
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,980
change. The character has a sudden

418
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,400
change of heart, often used in short

419
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,860
stories.

420
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,660
In den Geschichten, die Charaktere

421
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,980
verändern sich. Es kann also entweder

422
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,560
ein graduales Entwicklung sein, also

423
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,300
wo man es sehen kann, oder ein

424
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,140
abruptes Verändern. Es wird oft in

425
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,740
Kurzgeschichten genannt. Um den

426
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,240
Entwicklung eines Charakters zu

427
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,360
analysieren, müssen wir die Gründe

428
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,140
für den Veränderung identifizieren,

429
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,040
wie zum Beispiel, was passiert ist

430
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,880
oder warum es passiert ist oder so

431
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,880
weiter. und finden wichtige Quote und

432
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,180
Extrakte, die den Veränderung

433
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,140
signalisieren. Also brauchen wir, um

434
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,640
eine

435
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,520
Quote zu bekommen oder den Extrakt

436
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,080
aus dem Text zu bekommen, der bereits

437
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,700
einen Hinweis

438
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,260
auf den Veränderung aufgibt. So they

439
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,520
put like an important, for example,

440
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,620
question mark or exclamation mark or

441
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,800
whatever. So the story gives us

442
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,640
already a hint of why the person

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,440
changes and we need to find it in the

444
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,760
text.

445
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,130
Tasks. So possible tasks concerning

446
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,070
characters can be. Who are the main

447
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,530
characters? How are they presented?

448
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,250
What is the characters function in

449
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,590
the text? Describe the character. Pay

450
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,370
attention to the ...

451
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,770
All these possible tasks can be in

452
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,050
your exam. So, yeah, who are the main

453
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,530
characters? How are they presented?

454
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,430
For example, we just had Lee and

455
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,590
Orson. And now you have to present

456
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,010
them. You have to describe them in

457
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,830
detail. Yeah, and analyze their

458
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:52,930
behavior, whatever. Another exercise.

459
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,150
Ernst Hemingway, the old man and the

460
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,450
sea. So, the task at the end will

461
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,150
be... He characterized the old man by

462
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,910
using the information that I've given

463
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,050
in the text. Define the relationship

464
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,850
between the two characters and

465
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,870
explain your reasons. He was an old

466
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,050
man who fished alone in a skiff in

467
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,990
the Gulf Stream and he had gone 84

468
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,450
days now without taking a fish. In

469
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,310
the first 40 days the boy had been

470
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,110
with him. But after 40 days without a

471
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,490
fish the boy's parents had told him

472
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,470
that the old man was now definitely

473
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,650
and finally salaud, which is the

474
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,590
worst form of unlove. und der Junge

475
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,910
war in einem anderen Boot, in dem er

476
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,290
drei gute Fische die erste Woche

477
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,530
gefangen hat. Das hat den Junge

478
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,770
gesagt, um den alten Mann jeden Tag

479
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,570
mit seinem Geschenk zu sehen, und er

480
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,030
war immer da, um ihn zu helfen,

481
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,950
entweder die Kuitlein oder die Gaff

482
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,950
und Harpoon zu tragen, und der Seil,

483
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,330
der um die Masse geführt wurde. The

484
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,450
sail was pitched with four floor

485
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,570
sacks and furled it looked like the

486
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,150
flag of permanent defeat. The old man

487
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,250
was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles

488
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,690
in the back of his neck. The brown

489
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,470
blotches of a benevolent skin cancer

490
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,190
the sun brings from its reflection on

491
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,490
the tropic sea were on his cheeks.

492
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,250
The blotches ran well down the sides

493
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,610
of his face and his hands had the

494
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,190
deep crease. ...

495
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,670
So, now please characterize the old

496
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,230
man by using the information that

497
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,170
I've given in the text. Define the

498
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,370
relationship between the two

499
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,050
characters and explain your reasons.

500
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,430
So, first characterize the old man.

501
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,150
So, can someone tell me, please write

502
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,990
in the box, yeah, some

503
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,030
characteristics of the old man. Can

504
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,030
you tell me? So, some important facts

505
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,410
about the old man. For example, his

506
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,910
behavior, how does he look like? So,

507
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,110
oddward appearance.

508
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,150
Any ideas?

509
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,890
For example, so, we can tell about

510
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,730
the old man that he was odd. So,

511
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,490
then, here.

512
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,410
The old man was thin and gone with

513
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,310
deep wrinkles in the back of his

514
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,210
neck. He

515
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,380
had deep crease scars.

516
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,620
Someone just gave him... Er hat mir

517
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,220
eine Antwort gegeben. Er ist

518
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,560
diszipliniert, wenn er nicht auf

519
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,200
Fisch abgibt. Das ist richtig. Er ist

520
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,180
sehr diszipliniert und er will

521
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,880
wirklich nicht auf Fisch abgeben. Er

522
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,380
ist wirklich dazu, dass er nicht auf

523
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,220
Fisch abgeben will. Das ist ein sehr

524
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,960
wichtiger Faktor für diesen alten

525
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,420
Mann. Das ist die Hauptstelle des

526
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,560
Geschichts, dass der alte Mann, auch

527
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,120
wenn er keinen Fisch bekommt, He is

528
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,860
still fishing. He doesn't stop. Very

529
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,880
good. And now the relationship

530
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,620
between the two characters. So

531
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,180
between the boy and the old man. Can

532
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,260
someone tell me, how is the

533
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,700
relationship? Is it good? Is it bad?

534
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,980
Is it friendly? Is it peaceful? Is it

535
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,600
like, are they enemies? What are

536
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
they? Are they friends? Yes,

537
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,280
they are friends and... Someone else

538
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,600
typing.

539
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,660
Okay, so they are friends. And you

540
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,900
can... Man sieht, dass der alte Mann

541
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,620
immer den jungen Jungen mit ihm

542
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,360
mitgenommen hat, um mit ihm angeln zu

543
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,140
gehen. Aber jetzt, als der alte Mann

544
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,320
keine mehr Fische bekommt, verändert

545
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,700
sich der junge Junge in ein anderes

546
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,880
Boot. Und jetzt fühlt sich der junge

547
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,600
Junge ein wenig traurig darüber. Aber

548
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,060
jeden Abend, wenn sie zurückkommen,

549
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,040
hilft der junge Junge dem alten Mann,

550
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,880
die Dinge aus diesem Boot zu

551
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,320
bekommen. So they are more, so they

552
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,820
are friendlier,

553
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,980
like before. So being friendly and

554
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,840
everything, he gives it back, so he

555
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,020
helps him now. Yeah. So the

556
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,600
relationship between them is very

557
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,860
friendly, very peaceful, and they are

558
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,740
helping each other, but in different

559
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,790
ways. It can be like, for example,

560
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,890
emotionally. And so the old man, the

561
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,710
young boy, emotionally, he's there

562
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,230
for him. And he gives them, for

563
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,610
example. hints of how he can do it.

564
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,670
And the young boy now helps him

565
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,110
physically with his power to

566
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,590
transport things out of the boat.

567
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,660
Plot. The plot of a narration

568
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,500
consists of a series of events that

569
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,240
are interconnected. The plot of a

570
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,980
text always contains a starting

571
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
situation, opportunities for action,

572
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,360
a change of situation resulting from

573
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,860
an action. In order to analyze the

574
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,680
relevance of events, we have to

575
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,840
identify their symbolic

576
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,800
Also wenn etwas passiert, ist es

577
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,580
chronologisch oder ist es ein

578
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,740
Flashback oder was passiert. Das ist

579
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,380
wichtig, um einen Sinn zu bekommen,

580
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,460
wie die Geschichte geschrieben wird.

581
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,090
Klimax. Der Klimax ist die Part der

582
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,550
Geschichte, wo der höchste Punkt der

583
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,670
Tension erreicht wird. Das ist

584
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,470
normalerweise der Punkt, wo wir den

585
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,610
Hauptproblem der Geschichte befinden,

586
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,130
der dann von einem oder mehr

587
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:03,830
Hauptcharakteren geschlossen wird.

588
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,350
This often results in a change. For

589
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,870
example, the character constellation

590
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,410
is affected because the relationship

591
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,870
between two characters is

592
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,590
strengthened or an argument is

593
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,770
resolved. That's why the climax is

594
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,450
also often referred to as a turning

595
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,430
point. So a story is mostly built as

596
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,590
there's a rising tension, then

597
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,970
there's a climax. Like the main part

598
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,330
is happening and then there's a

599
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,090
falling tension. That's like... wie

600
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,630
die Geschichte gebaut wird.

601
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,060
Open Ending. Der Ende ist einer der

602
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,860
wichtigsten Teilen der Geschichte.

603
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,840
Wir würden auch erwarten, dass die

604
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,340
Geschichte zu Ende kommt. Das ist

605
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,600
nicht immer der Fall. Manchmal gibt

606
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,040
der Ende der Geschichte keine Lösung,

607
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,460
aber es ist offen. Deshalb könnte die

608
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,340
Geschichte in verschiedene Richtungen

609
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,820
gehen und es ist an den Leser, um den

610
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,360
möglichen Ergebnis zu vorstellen.

611
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,280
Dadurch, Using an open end in a story

612
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,560
motivates the reader to think and to

613
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,180
deal with the subject matter of the

614
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,240
text. Open endings are especially

615
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,020
common in short stories. So, a story

616
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,080
doesn't need an ending, but it also

617
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,840
can have an open ending. And this is

618
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,700
very common for short stories.

619
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,130
So, possible tasks concerning the

620
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,830
plot can be Describe the sequence of

621
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,390
events of the story. How are the

622
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,330
events interconnected?

623
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,270
So all these questions are possible

624
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,910
tasks you can get asked in an exam,

625
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,170
like in an oral exam, whatever, in an

626
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:56,530
essay.

627
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,810
So, useful phrases for... The

628
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,390
sequence of events. The story is told

629
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,010
chronologically. The story disregards

630
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,330
the chronological order. Later events

631
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,370
are foreshadowed when the story

632
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,410
switches from the present to the past

633
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,970
or the other way around. An event

634
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,730
marks a shift in time. The narrator

635
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,610
uses retro-perspective narration too.

636
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,010
An event anticipates future events.

637
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,090
So useful phrases for the sequence of

638
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,790
events. Useful phrases for the

639
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,990
division of narration. The narrator

640
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,230
tells the story in parts. Five parts,

641
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,630
six parts, whatever. Two parts. The

642
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,530
development rises to a climax when

643
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,150
this and this happens. The story is

644
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,170
organized in major events. Six,

645
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,070
seven, one, two. The story can be

646
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,610
divided into. The story has a

647
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,950
surprise ending. Ending, whatever.

648
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,450
and the event correlates with another

649
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,170
event. So, these are useful phrases

650
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,050
for the composition. That's it. Thank

651
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,770
you for listening. Do you have any

652
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,970
questions? Any questions, please

653
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,750
write in the chat box. If not, yeah,

654
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,930
thank you for listening. You can give

655
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,110
me feedback if you want. Yeah.

656
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,520
So, yes. I'm waiting for you to...

657
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,940
Ask some questions or give me

658
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,340
feedback.

659
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,880
Thank you, Linus. So, at 11 there's

660
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,420
another webinar with me. Another from

661
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,220
the English Abitur Reihe. And at 12

662
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,260
there's another one. So, there's one

663
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,260
at 11 and at 12. So, maybe we see

664
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,980
each other again. And thank you for

665
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,220
listening. So, if that's it, I would

666
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,480
stop the webinar. I would end it. And

667
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
I wish you good luck for your future

668
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,080
exams, for your A-Levels, whatever.

669
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,200
We see each other again, hopefully in

670
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,180
one or two hours. We'll see. Thank

671
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,240
you and bye. Have a nice day and good

672
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,440
luck. Ciao.
