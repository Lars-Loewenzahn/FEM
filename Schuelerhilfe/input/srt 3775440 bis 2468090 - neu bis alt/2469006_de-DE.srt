00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome to our webinar on the topic

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,660
of analyzing scientific texts. So

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,440
before analyzing a scientific text,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,040
let's take a look what scientific

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,700
texts actually are. Scientific texts

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,540
and also historical texts,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
technological texts, accounts or

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,140
reports are directed at a

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,780
professional audience or a reader

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,520
that is interested in in the subject

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,360
matter. So typical characteristics of

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,060
scientific texts are an expository

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,020
structure, a main purpose that is

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,620
developed, although also additional

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,980
ideas and thoughts might be included

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,300
in the text. The usage of a

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,340
professional terminology, a formal

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,560
and objective language, complex

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,160
sentences and abundant evidence. also

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,860
Quoten aus anderen wissenschaftlichen

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,800
Texten, Grafen und Figuren, um die

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,320
Argumente des Autors zu unterstützen.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,160
Wissenschaftliche Texte benutzen

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,360
meistens fünf Strukturen.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,280
Generalisierung, also die Hauptideen

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,860
sind gestaltet oder durch Erklärungen

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,780
oder Beispiele klargestellt.

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,300
Enumeration, also die Liste von

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,500
Fakten für ein Thema. Sequence, which

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,340
means they list up a series of events

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,100
or steps that are connected.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,660
Classification, meaning a grouping of

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,700
items into classes. And comparison or

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,980
contrast, a relationship between two

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,200
or more subjects is established and

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,360
or analyzed.

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,120
Now how can we identify claims?

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,780
Claims are the basis for any

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,160
argument. Whenever we want to support

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,580
our position, we need claims to be

41
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,000
convincing. These claims can be

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,940
categorized into claims of fact or

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,140
definition, comparison, cause, value

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,560
and policy. And all of these claims

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,960
need to be supported by reliable

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,650
sources. So let's start with claims

47
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,030
of fact. Claims of Fact answer the

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,970
following questions. Did it happen?

49
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,130
Is it true? Does it exist? Or is it a

50
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,650
fact? They can be supported by facts,

51
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,330
inductive reasoning, like citing

52
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,810
examples and then drawing

53
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,970
conclusions, by analogies, signs and

54
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,570
expert opinions. Claims of Fact can

55
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,750
be organized in chronological order.

56
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,170
Topical Order, depending on the

57
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,930
author's wishes. Usually they are one

58
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,890
of the first claims to be made in an

59
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,230
argument.

60
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,780
Claims of definition answer the

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,980
following questions. How should it be

62
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,040
classified? What is it? What is it

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,620
like? How should it be interpreted?

64
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,980
How does the meaning change in a in

65
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,740
einem spezifischen Kontext. Sie

66
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,520
können von vertraglichen Sourcen,

67
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,660
Autoritäten und Analogen unterstützt

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,520
werden. Begriffe der Definition sind

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,100
benutzt, um zu vergleichen und

70
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,860
Kontrast zu machen, aber auch um

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,700
Gründe für die Kontroverse zu geben,

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,960
also zu erklären, warum man eine

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,820
alternative Sicht akzeptieren sollte.

74
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,040
Sie können auch in einer topischen

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,560
Art umgesetzt werden.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,100
Begriffe von Grundsätzen beantworten

77
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,380
die folgenden Fragen. What is the

78
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,400
cause? Where did it come from? What

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,020
are the effects? What did happen?

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,240
Which results can be expected short

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,380
and long term?

82
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,290
They can be supported by factual

83
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,810
data, analogies, statistics, signs of

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,450
certain causes, induction and

85
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:32,390
deduction. So claims of cause are

86
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,950
claims.

87
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,400
auf die Konsequenzen selbst, also

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,740
welche Auswirkungen hat eine

89
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,220
Konsequenz und was genau passiert

90
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,240
ist, zum Beispiel in einem

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,600
Experiment.

92
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,590
Begriffe von Wert beantworten die

93
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,530
folgenden Fragen. Ist es gut oder

94
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,570
schlecht? Wie schlecht oder wie gut

95
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,050
ist es? Was ist es wert? Ist es moral

96
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,010
oder immoral? Welche Leute denken es

97
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,710
so? Und was ist wert? What values of

98
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,310
criteria are recommended to determine

99
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,810
the goodness, badness of it? Do my

100
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,970
values differ from other people's

101
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,090
values? They can be supported by

102
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,270
motivational appeals, analogies,

103
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,670
appeals to value, quotation from

104
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,710
authorities, induction, signs and

105
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,170
definitions.

106
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,290
Claims of policy answer the...

107
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,530
folgende Fragen. Wie sollten wir

108
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,130
umgehen? Was sollen wir tun? Wie

109
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,370
sollten die Policien in der Zukunft

110
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,170
verändern? Wie kann ein Problem

111
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,590
geschlossen werden? Welcher Kurs der

112
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,930
Aktion ist notwendig, um ein Problem

113
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,250
zu lösen? Wie Sie schon sehen,

114
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:02,930
fokussieren sich die Begriffe der

115
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,710
Politik meistens auf die Zukunft.

116
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,850
Diese können von Daten, Statistiken,

117
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,770
Definitionen, moralischen und

118
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,170
gemeinsamen Sinn Motivationale

119
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,630
Begriffe, Argumente von Autoritäten,

120
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,490
Ausgaben und literäre Analogen. Da

121
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,340
Argumente ein Teil von

122
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,780
wissenschaftlichen Texten sind, sind

123
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,440
Begriffe für ihre Struktur wichtig.

124
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,720
Normalerweise gibt es nicht nur einen

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,260
bestimmten Begriff in einem Text. Es

126
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,800
ist möglich, dass zwei oder mehr

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,100
verschiedene Begriffe gefunden werden

128
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,650
können. Es ist immer nützlich, um die

129
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,710
größte, vorausschreitende Begriffe zu

130
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,010
identifizieren, which supports the

131
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,930
main purpose of the argument. You

132
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,870
should also know how the claim is

133
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,890
supported, like if it's by analogies

134
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,770
or an expert opinion, and if the

135
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,270
author used a certain strategy to

136
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,490
organize the argument.

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,500
An essay is a special form of

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,020
scientific text. The aim of an essay

139
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,040
is not to report with scientific

140
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,900
accuracy. The focus of an essay is to

141
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,680
deal with the subject matter from the

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,940
viewpoint in a structured manner. So,

143
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,400
an essay is not supposed to convince

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,100
a reader.

145
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,320
The author works around a leading

146
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,420
question. An essay is supposed to be

147
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,660
short, but sophisticated and

148
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,340
subjective. Usually, you will not

149
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,740
find new insights or empirical

150
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,260
findings, but an already existing

151
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,180
Essays can be expository or

152
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,660
argumentative and they want to give

153
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,660
the reader something to think about.

154
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,130
In order to analyze a scientific

155
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,070
text, here are some of the most

156
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,890
common tasks. Analyze the structural

157
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,690
elements of the following text. How

158
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,750
is the subject matter presented? What

159
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,590
is the author's attitude towards the

160
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,770
subject? How is the reader influenced

161
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,630
by the structure of the text?

162
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,290
Consider the different kinds of

163
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,750
structures and claims that are

164
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,450
commonly used in scientific texts.

165
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,190
Connect these two concepts and

166
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,270
analyze the author's intentions and

167
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,030
the effects that are caused by the

168
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,730
structural elements and organization.

169
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,630
It is important that you do not have

170
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,550
to interpret the scientific text.

171
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,990
These are supposed to inform and

172
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,310
deliver facts. Sie sollten sich auf

173
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,790
die Struktur und die Organisation

174
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,150
konzentrieren. Schauen Sie, welche

175
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,150
Art von Sourcen ein Autor benutzt

176
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,190
hat, nicht, welche Art von Worten er

177
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,870
dafür benutzt hat.

178
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,070
Also am Ende haben wir hier ein

179
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,450
Übungsprozess. hier. You're supposed

180
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,090
to take a look at Francesco

181
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,430
Alberoni's text, Stardom and

182
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,950
Charisma, and analyze how the issue

183
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,170
of the text is presented. Identify

184
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,670
structural elements that are used to

185
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,090
emphasize the message of the text.

186
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,090
And

187
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,620
with that, we're at the end of our

188
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,760
webinar. I want to thank you for your

189
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
attention and hope you have an Nice

190
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,000
day!
