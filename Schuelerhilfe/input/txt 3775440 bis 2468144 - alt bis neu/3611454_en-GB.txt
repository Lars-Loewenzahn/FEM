00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,830
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,230
Power Laws and Roots. 

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,970
In this webinar, we will primarily be 

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,850
looking at power laws and roots. 

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,910
First, we will look at a very 

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,670
brief review of powers and 

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,450
roots, then the power laws 

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,870
and then we will look at 

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,630
how you 

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,430
can switch between the root and the power 
notation 

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,170
, i.e. how you can convert it. 

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,790
There's a little formula for this that 

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,870
works quite well. And at the very 

14
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,910
end, we'll look at how you 

15
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,250
can take partial roots and how you can 

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,430

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,190
simplify terms using the power laws and 
root laws 

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,050
. Let's start with the short 

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,670
repetition. 

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,170
First of all, we see a power above. This 
consists 

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,070
of a base and an exponent. 

22
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,770
The base is always what is at the bottom 

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,470
and the exponent is what is at the top 

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,970
. To explain this, 

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,050
x² is, for example, x times x, x to the 
power of 3 

26
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,710
is x times x times x, i.e. the 

27
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,130
exponent indicates how often the base 

28
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,330
is multiplied by itself. x 

29
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,370
to the power of n is then simply x times x 
times x 

30
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,910
and the whole thing n times. And 

31
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,450
this is not necessarily 

32
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,330
similar for a root , but there is also 
something 

33
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,550
like an exponent, which is called 

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,410
a root exponent here. 

35
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,990
However, this is not always written down 
if 

36
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,550
there is nothing there. And this is 

37
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,050
often the case, the 

38
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,010
square root is always meant. So in 

39
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,450
this case, n is equal to 2, which is the 

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,990
square root. And as I said, if 

41
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,350
this is used, it is not 

42
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,790
written down, but for every 

43
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,030
other root it is and must 

44
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,670
be written down. What is under 

45
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,190
the root is the so-called 

46
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,050
radical. And the 

47
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,130
root is taken from this. For example, the 

48
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,870
root of 25 is 5, or 

49
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,430
there is nothing here, so it is 

50
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,750
the square root. And that's 

51
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,950
because 5 to the power of 2 is 5 times 5 

52
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,790
, or 25. Here you can see 

53
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,590
the third root of 27 and, as 

54
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,130
I said earlier, if you don't 

55
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,630

56
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,810
take the square root, i.e. the second 
root, you have to 

57
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,250
write down the root exponent . And the 
third 

58
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,030
root of 27 is 3, because 3 to the power of 
3 

59
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,830
is 27. In general, the 

60
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,330
square root of x² equals x again 

61
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,370
This means that if the 

62
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,990
root exponent is the same as 

63
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,290
the exponent of the radical, 

64
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,050
the root is omitted 

65
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,530
We will see later why this is the case 

66
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,570
Let's move on to the 

67
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,430
power laws We see here the 

68
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,170
power law, which is to be applied 

69
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,910
if we have the same base We 

70
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,210
see here that we have the base A and 

71
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,370
then we have different 

72
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,450
powers, one m and one n. And power , we 
have the power law. 

73
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,390
And if we 

74
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,260
have a to the power of m times a to the 
power of n , that is a to the power of m 
plus n. The 

75
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,860
whole thing can also be 

76
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,700
filled with a few numbers, i.e. 4 to the 
power of 2 times 4 

77
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,940
to the power of 4 is equal to 4 to the 
power of 2 plus 4 

78
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,620
or 4 to the power of 6. Why the 

79
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,600
whole thing works? can also be 

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,820
explained like this . a to the power of m 
times a to the power of n. 

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,580
In other words, we have a times a times a 
times a 

82
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,020
times a and so on. So m times a and 

83
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,000
then the times in between. a times a times 

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,640
a times n times a. And together we have m 

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,840
plus n times the a. They are only 

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,300
separated by a sign and 

87
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,780
therefore it is simply a 

88
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,420
sequence. and the experiment, 

89
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,700
as I said earlier, indicates 

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,600
how often the number 

91
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,340
is multiplied by itself. 

92
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,300
This is the case here m plus n times. 
Let's 

93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,140
move on to what happens when you 

94
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,640
raise a power. Here we have a 

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,260
to the power of m to the power of m. So we 

96
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,620
are now raising a power. For example, 

97
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,220
something like 3 to the power of 5 to the 
power of 7. And whenever 

98
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,200
you raise a power, 

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,640
the two... exponents 

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,040
are multiplied. This means that 3 to the 
power of 5 

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,040
to the power of 7 is 3 to the power of 5 
times 7, i.e. 3 

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,320
to the power of 35. You can imagine the 
whole thing as 

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,940
follows. 

104
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,080
First we have m times our a and then 

105
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,440
we have n times our a. We have 

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,240
a grid with, if you like, m 

107
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,800
rows and n columns and the question 

108
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,060
we have to ask ourselves now is 

109
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,920
simply how many a's we have. 

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,140
And that's the same calculation as 

111
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,700
before with the bricks in the 

112
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,500
classroom. We simply multiply the 

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,540
number of bricks in a row by 

114
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,700
the number of columns to get 

115
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,480
n times m. And that's how we can 

116
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,460
calculate the number of a's here. 

117
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,440
And that's why a power that 

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,460
is raised to the power... is then 

119
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,080
multiplied, as 

120
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,660
shown here above. 

121
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,050
Let's move on to multiplying 

122
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,110
powers with the same exponent. 

123
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,850
Here we see a to the power of n times b to 
the power of n. This 

124
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,170
means that we have the same 

125
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,050
exponent n. However, the bases are 

126
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,790
different a and b. And in this case, 

127
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,590
it is simply the case that a to the power 
of n 

128
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,930
times b to the power of n 

129
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,170
is simply a times b to the power of n . 
This means that we offset 

130
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,330
the two bases against each other. The 

131
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,230
exponent is the same and it 

132
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,310
simply remains the same and we 

133
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,510
simply offset the whole 

134
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,870
bases against each other, or 

135
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,570
the two bases. And this 

136
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,930
works for the simple reason that 

137
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,790
we have just as many a's as 

138
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,430
b's, n times. And therefore 

139
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,530
we can always form pairs, a, b. And 

140
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,550
we then have n a, b pairs. That 

141
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,550
is then a, b to the power of n. That's how 

142
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,170
the whole thing works. 

143
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Of course, you can not only 

144
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,060
multiply powers , you can also 

145
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,540
divide or divide them . For example, 

146
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,940
a to the power of m divided by a to the 
power of n. This 

147
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,040
means 

148
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,380
that a distinction is made here again as 
to whether we 

149
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,240
have the same base or the same 

150
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,920
exponent. In this case, we have the 

151
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,600
same base, i.e. a. And it is 

152
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,340
now the case that a to the power of m 
divided by a 

153
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,800
to the power of n is a to the power of m 
divided by a to the power of n. 

154
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,300
And whenever we have a divisor 

155
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,860
, we don't 

156
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
add as we do with multiplication , we 
subtract. a 

157
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,640
to the power of m divided by a to the 
power of n is a 

158
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,220
to the power of m minus n. This means that 
if we 

159
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,660

160
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,420
want to fill this with a few numbers , 4 
to the power of 6 divided by 4 to the 
power of 

161
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,440
2 is 4 to the power of 6 minus 2, i.e. 4 
to the power of 

162
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,860
4. The whole thing works, you can 

163
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,040
simply make a fraction out of it. 

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,120
And then you can 

165
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,100
reduce the corresponding number of bases. 

166
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,520
In other words, for the example, which is 

167
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,300
practically drawn in here, a times a times 
a times a times 

168
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,080
a times a times a, that is a to the power 
of 

169
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,100
6. And a times a times a times a times a 
would be a 

170
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,460
to the power of 4. And then we could 

171
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,140
reduce 4 a out. The 3, the 3 and that 

172
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,920
. Then only a times a remains, i.e. a 

173
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,620
to the power of 2. And 6 minus 4 is also 

174
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,180
2, so it only works 

175
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,880
by truncating. 

176
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,340
Another important point is that 

177
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,640
a negative exponent produces 

178
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,700
the reciprocal value. This means that a 

179
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,460
to the power of minus n is 1 by a to the 
power of n. 

180
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,000
Or 5 to the power of minus 2 is 1 by 5 

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,720
to the power of 2. Or just 1 25, because 5 
to the power of 2 

182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,260
is 25. Why does this work? 

183
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,480
It works, it's quite simple. 

184
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,620
We can 

185
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,760
imagine a to the power of minus n as a to 
the power of 0 minus n. 

186
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,120
We can add the 0. And if 

187
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,040
we now 

188
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,480
apply the power law the other way round, 
that is to say, 

189
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,020
dividing a to the power of 0 minus n 

190
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,520
is a to the power of 0 divided by a to the 
power of n. 

191
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,280
We can see here that we have the 

192
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,960
same base and we are dividing two 

193
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,380
powers by each other. That means 

194
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,460
we can 

195
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,640
write this as a fraction . And what comes 
with it? 

196
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,520
Anything to the power of 0, whether it's 
5, 

197
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,400
10 or 1, is always 1. a to the power of 0 
is 

198
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,480
therefore only 1. And so we 

199
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,980
end up with 1 divided by a to the power of 
n, and that 

200
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,380
's 1 divided by a to the power of n. So 
you can see that 

201
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,700
by adding a 

202
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,860
negative sign to the exponent 

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,180
, you get the reciprocal. So 

204
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,380
the power goes into the denominator. Here 
you can see 

205
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,540
a few 

206
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,100
more examples. We have a times a to the 
power of 

207
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,320
minus 1. Don't forget 

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,380
that the left-hand a is actually 

209
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,460
a to the power of 1. This means that we 
have a 

210
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,000
to the power of 1 times a to the power of 
minus 1. We have 

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,240
the same base. This means 

212
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,700
that we can 

213
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,320
add the two exponents together. That would 
now be 1 minus 

214
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,600
1, which is 0. So we are 

215
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,320
left with a to the power of 0 and, as we 
have just 

216
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,120
said, that is 1. The situation is 
different with 3 to the power of 

217
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
minus 1. 3 to the power of minus 1 is 1 

218
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
divided by 3 to the power of 1, or a 

219
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,020
third. The 

220
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,420
example below is more or less the same as 
the one above, only 

221
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,960
this time with a detailed 

222
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,060
calculation. We have 3 times 3 to the 
power of 

223
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,720
minus 1, which is actually the 

224
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,820
same as 3 to the power of 1 times 3 to the 
power of minus 

225
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,280
1. Then we have 1 minus 1 

226
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,280
is 0 again , or 3 to the power of 0 is 

227
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,560
1 again. This already agrees with 

228
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,840
our final result. 

229
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
But you can also 

230
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,920
do the whole thing in detail. Then you get 
3 times 1 

231
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,880
third, 3 to the power of minus 1 is 1 

232
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,240
third. And then you can add the 3 to 

233
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,460
the numerator and we have 3 

234
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,920
thirds. We can, and 3 thirds 

235
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,120
is a whole, you could 

236
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,980
shorten that or say it's a 

237
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,080
whole. In any case, it's 

238
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,640
1 at the end 

239
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,610
. Now let's move on to how you 

240
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,930

241
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,290
can switch from power notation to root 
notation. 

242
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,860
Here, we see that a raised to the power of 
1 by 

243
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,140
m is equal to the mth root of a. 

244
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,480
In other words, you can see that the 

245
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,000
root exponent is equal to the denominator 

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,520
of the... exponent. In other words, 27 to 
the power of one 

247
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,460
third is the same as the 

248
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,520
third root of 27. And to 

249
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,460
make this formula complete, the 

250
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,360
numerator is added, the n. Because a to 
the power of n 

251
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,440
divided by m is equal to the mth root 

252
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,760
of a to the power of n. So the exponent of 
the 

253
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,580
radical is still 

254
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,580
the exponent here and the root exponent 

255
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,200
is the denominator of the fraction in the 

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,400
exponent. So you can see here, this 

257
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,100
is the m, this is the n, that is 

258
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,780
as much as 4 to the power of 3 half is 
equal to 

259
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,780
the second root of 4 to the power of 3. If 

260
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,560
you see that it is still in the 

261
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,420
exponent, here it is also in the 

262
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,240
numerator of the exponent and the 

263
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,660
root exponent is in the denominator. 

264
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,580
Denominator of the exponent. This means 
that 

265
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,300
you can always switch between 

266
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,400
power notation and 

267
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,510
root notation. This brings us to 

268
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,070
the next 

269
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,530
topic, which is partial 

270
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,930
 root extraction. Partial 

271
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,710
 root extraction is used to 

272
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:16,110
make quite large numbers smaller and thus 
to 

273
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,870

274
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,030
extract at least part of the root , even 
if you may not be able to extract the 
whole... 

275
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,290
root may not be possible. 

276
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,630
And that means that the 

277
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,370
root law is important here : the root of A 
times B 

278
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,330
is equal to the root of A times the 

279
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,530
root of B. As I said, this works 

280
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,710
as long as 

281
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,730
you are multiplying. And the idea with 
partial 

282
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,230
root extraction is simply to 

283
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,390
divide the radical into factors 

284
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,210
from which we 

285
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,570
can extract the root of at least one 
factor. Yes, 

286
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,170
so there's no point in doing it 

287
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,030
clumsily and 

288
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,330
still 

289
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,190
not knowing the roots of both factors , 
which is 

290
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,250
unfavorable. You should 

291
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,410

292
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,190

293
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,350
be able to take the root of one or more of 
the two factors. And you 

294
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,170
then divide these factors into individual 
roots in order to extract the 

295
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,250
individual roots. And you 

296
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,070
then take all the roots that you can 

297
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,730
and cannot take, 

298
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,990
which unfortunately remain. For 

299
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,210
example, here we have the root 

300
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,290
of 44, which can be written as 

301
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,210
the root of 4 times 11. 

302
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,430
Unfortunately, we cannot take the root of 
11 

303
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,510
, but we can take the root of 4. This 
means that we can take 

304
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,870
the root of 4 times the root of 

305
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,810
11. The root of 4 is 2. 

306
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,510
Unfortunately, as 

307
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,390
I said earlier, we cannot easily 

308
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,770
take the root of 11. So we 

309
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,590
only take the root partially, i.e. 2 times 
the root of 11. 

310
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,830
Here below is an example of what 

311
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,610
is actually the advantageous 

312
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,970
root extraction. We have the 

313
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,750
root of 1600 and that could be 

314
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,110
written as 16 times the root of 

315
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:56,570
100 or 16 

316
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,030

317
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,630

318
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,430

319
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,770
times 4 times 25, sorry, not 16 times the 
root of 100, but the root of 16 times 100. 

320
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,010
And if we now 

321
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,790
think about it for a moment, we 

322
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,570
realize that we can take the 

323
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,410
root of 16 , we can 

324
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,090
take the root of 4 and 

325
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,430
we can also take the root of 25. 

326
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,870
This means that we now put all 

327
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,190
three factors under an 

328
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,070
independent root. 

329
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,290
This gives us the root of 16 times the 
root 

330
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,130
of 4 times the root of 25. The 

331
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,470
root of 16 is 4. The root of 

332
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,990
4 is 2, the root of 25 is 5. 

333
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,030
This gives us 4 times 2 times 5. And 

334
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,970
we now have to 

335
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,110
carry out this multiplication . 

336
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,030
We multiply this and arrive at 40. This 

337
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,650
means that we can finally say that 

338
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,770
the square root of 1600 is 40. 

339
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,760
Here is another 

340
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,160
example. Root 2 times 2 to the power of 3 
to the power of 

341
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,740
1.5. So we now need 

342
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,140
all the 

343
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,920
laws presented in this webinar , i.e. 
power laws and also 

344
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,620
the root law. And we also need to 

345
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,020

346
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,300
be able to switch from root notation to 
power notation. 

347
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,340
Let's start with the square root of 2. 

348
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,020
The square root of 2 is 2 to the power of 
1.5. There' 

349
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,600
s nothing at the top here , which means it 

350
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,080
's the square root, so it' 

351
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,500
s basically a 2. and the radical has 

352
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,880
no exponent, which means it's a 

353
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,960
1, so we get 2 to the power of 1 half for 

354
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,340
the root of 2 here on the right we have 

355
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,000
2 to the power of 3 to the power of 1 
half, which means 

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,700
we are exponentiating a power, so 

357
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,200
we have to multiply 3 x 1 half 

358
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,780
is 3 half and look at it all over 

359
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,140
again we see we have the 

360
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,720
same base 2 but we have 

361
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,180
different exponents 

362
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,520
, but that's not a problem because we can 

363
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,860
now 

364
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,280
simply 

365
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,080
add the two exponents because we have the 
same base . So 1.5 plus 3.5. This gives 

366
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,520
us 2 to the power of 1.5 plus 3.5. 

367
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,780
That's 2 to the power of 4.5. Now you 
could 

368
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,040
of course say, okay, 2 to the power of 4.5 
is 

369
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,400
2 to the power of 2. That's 4. Then we'd 
be 

370
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,520
right down here. But you can 

371
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,080
also convert this fraction back into 

372
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,400
root notation, in which case 

373
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,600
it is 2 to the power of 4 and 

374
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
the square root of that , i.e. the 

375
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,860
square root of 2 to the power of 4 and 2 
to the power of 

376
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,400
4 is 16 and the square root of 16 

377
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,680
is 4. So you can see that although we 

378
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,460

379
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,740
have chosen a completely different way , 
we get the same 

380
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,440
result and that is 4. 

381
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,190
Here we have another 

382
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,150
example, 3 to the power of 3 divided by 9 
or 3 

383
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,030
to the power of 3 ninths, as you 

384
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,540
would like to express it. 3 to the power 
of 3 times 1 ninth 

385
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,720
, which is the same 

386
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,360
as 3 to the power of 3 times 1 ninth. And 

387
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,840
we can write the 9 as 3 to the power of 2. 
This gives 

388
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,980
us 3 to the power of 3 times 1 by 3 

389
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,360
to the power of 2. Now comes the matter of 

390
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,800
the negative exponent again 

391
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,920
, or the inverse fraction. And 

392
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,780
we can write 1 divided by 3 to the power 
of 2 

393
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,200
as 3 to the power of minus 2. This gives 
us 

394
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,480
3 to the power of 3. 3 to the power of 3 
times 3 to the power of minus 

395
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,120
2. Again, we see that we 

396
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,580
have the same base both times. 

397
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,560
In other words, we simply add 

398
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,640
our two exponents, i.e. 3 plus 

399
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,080
minus 2. This gives us 3 to the power of 3 

400
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,040
plus minus 2. 3 plus minus 2 is 1. 

401
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,960
This gives us 3 to the power of 1, i.e. 3. 

402
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,840
And we have already 

403
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,240
simplified this as much as possible. 

404
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,500
That brings us to the end of 

405
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,280
the webinar. Thank you 

406
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,880
very much for your attention.
