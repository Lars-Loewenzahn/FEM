00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,040
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,900
Hypothesis testing, significance level and 

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,780
first and second order error. In 

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,440
this webinar, we will primarily focus on 

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,860
hypothesis testing 

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,500
and will also discuss 

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,600
significance levels 

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,260
and first and second order errors . 

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,620
These are essential components 

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,260
of hypothesis testing. At the very 
beginning, 

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,480
we will look at a short introduction 

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,720
, look at what the 

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,360
hypothesis test can be used for and what 

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,100
it is used for. 

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,540
We will then look at the possible errors 
of a 

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,000
hypothesis test and we will 

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,980
also use a short example to 

18
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,060
explain why the hypothesis test 

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,900
is carried out the way it is 

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
. We will then 

21
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,800
look at the first and second type of error 

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,240
and the 

23
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,020
significance level. We will then 

24
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,580
carry out the hypothesis test 

25
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,100
in full, i.e. the 

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,820
correct one , and look at 

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,300
how to choose H0 and HA and 

28
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,200
, of course, how the choice of HA and H0 

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,560
influences the calculation 

30
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,780
and perhaps also the 

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,740
results. At the very end, 

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,180
we' 

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,520

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,440
ll go back to the most important points, 
i.e. how to choose H0 and HA, 

35
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,480
and the advantages and disadvantages of 
doing so. 

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,500
Well, let's come 

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,760
back to what the hypothesis test is used 
for in the first 

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,400
place. A 

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,880
hypothesis test is actually nothing 

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,180
more than a random sample in which it 

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,620
is investigated whether a statement 

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,620
is true or false. This 

43
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,880
involves 

44
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,660
establishing a certain interval. This 

45
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,680
interval is then used to test the sample 

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,780
and, based on 

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,540
the result, it is possible to say whether 
an 

48
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,420
assertion is true or false. 

49
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,820
There are always 

50
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,700
exactly two hypotheses in hypothesis 
tests. One is 

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
the null hypothesis H0, which is the 

52
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,140
assertion, and the counter-hypothesis 

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,020
HA, which is the counter-assertion. 

54
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,160

55
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,120
We'll see exactly what this looks like in 
the example in a moment, and 

56
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,380
on the following slides we'll 

57
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,900
look at how such a hypothesis test 

58
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,360
works and what to look out for. 

59
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,440
Let's take a look at the 

60
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,840
scenario: a farmer wants to 

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,220
prove that more than 90% of his 

62
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,360
1000 cows produce at least 2 liters of 
milk 

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,180
per day. To do this, he takes a 

64
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,140
sample size of 100 cows and 

65
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,340
wants to prove that this is the case. The 
first 

66
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,760
question is how we 

67
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,220
choose H0 and HA. The farmer could choose 

68
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,360
H0 or HA. Here we can 

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
see what it would look like, which 

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
is correct. So of course it could 

71
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
be that H0 is correct, i.e. his 

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,580
claim that more than 90 percent 

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,380
of the 1000 cows 

74
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,240
give more than two liters of milk. If this 

75
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,300
is really true, then H0 would be correct 
and 

76
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,540
if the farmer 

77
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,280
has chosen H0 , he has also made the 

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,640
right decision. 

79
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,200
Of course, it looks exactly the other way 
around 

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
if HA is correct. In this 

81
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,580
case, HA is the scenario where 

82
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,700
less than 90% of the cows produce at least 
2 

83
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,120
liters of milk per day. If he had 

84
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
also opted for HA in this case 

85
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,500
, he would also have made 

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,180
the right decision. 

87
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,400

88
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,580
Of course, the wrong decision would then 
be made in the two gaps. 

89
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,980
This means that if the farmer 

90
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,400
opts for H0, but HA 

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
is actually the right choice, which 

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,300
the farmer cannot know, then 

93
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,280
he would have 

94
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,400
made the wrong decision . The same applies 
if 

95
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,480
the farmer decides in favor of HA 

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,200
, although in reality H0 

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,560
is correct. In these two red 

98
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,840
fields we now find the 

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,960
first and second type of error . 

100
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,700
This means that the first type of error 

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,460
describes the fact that you 

102
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,660
decide against the null hypothesis even 
though 

103
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,180
it is correct. The second 

104
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,440
type of error is that you decide in favor 
of the 

105
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,220
counter-hypothesis even though 

106
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,240
the null hypothesis is correct. 

107
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,490
Here we see it 

108
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,550
written out again. The first type of error 

109
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,310
means that H0 is correct, 

110
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:14,990
but you 

111
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,390
incorrectly decide against the 

112
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,870
null hypothesis and 

113
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,830
thus 

114
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,210
incorrectly reject the assertion. 

115
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,870
The second type of error is that H0 is 
false 

116
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,870
and you 

117
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,190
wrongly decide in favor of the 

118
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:34,200
null hypothesis. We will 

119
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,460
now illustrate what a layperson 

120
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,280
might do. Namely, we 

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,940
remember that 90% of cows should 

122
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,420
give more than 2 liters of milk. This is 

123
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,900
the farmer's assertion and he 

124
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,880
makes a sample size of 100 

125
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
cows. And now we could 

126
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,340
simply go here , we know the 

127
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,480
probability here , 90%, we know 

128
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,620
the sample size of 100 cows and we 

129
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,640
could now 

130
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,480
calculate the probability that 0 to 89 
cows 

131
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,460
give 2 liters of milk and 90 to 100. That 

132
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,800
would then be 41.68% and 58.32% 
respectively. 

133
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,800
Now, of course, we have to 

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,260
decide what the 

135
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,880
mathematical distribution looks like if 

136
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,260
we decide in favor of H0 or against the H0 

137
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,200
 hypothesis. If we 

138
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,920
decide in favor of the H0 hypothesis and 

139
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,060
H0 is correct, we have a 

140
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,440
probability of 58.32%. That 

141
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,060
's not bad at all. The 

142
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,820
problem is at the top right here. 

143
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,880
If we opt for HA and 

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,340
H0 is correct, we still 

145
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,800
have a probability of 41.68%. 

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,300
And that's our error of the first kind. 

147
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,820
That is... The problem is 

148
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,980
that we have a probability of 

149
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,500
more than 40% of making a mistake. 

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
And that is 

151
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,200
absolutely useless for a sample. In other 
words, we 

152
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,260
have to make sure that if we 

153
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,960
want to make a statement , there must 

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,400
be a small probability here. A 

155
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,980
probability of 40% means that 

156
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,180
you 

157
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,000

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,640
would actually have to be wrong once in 
every third attempt . It is out of the 
question, which is why 

159
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,280
it is not used in this way. And that's why 

160
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,960
this is the negative example of how 

161
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,440
not to do it, and that's why it said 

162
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,140
earlier how a layperson 

163
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,920
would do it. We are now going to 

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,560
set the interval for the 

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,320
first type of error to a maximum of 5%. 
And 

166
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,460
that is the so-called 

167
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,850
significance level. The so-called 

168
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,670
significance level is nothing 

169
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,430
more than the probability 

170
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,010
of the first type of error. It is usually 

171
00:06:53,010 --> 00:07:00,210
5% or 2%. In other words, we 

172
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,330
are now going in exactly the opposite 
direction to 

173
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,930
before. Earlier, we had simply 

174
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,910
assumed an interval and we 

175
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,270
realized that we had a 

176
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,450

177
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,410
probability of over 40% for the first type 
of error . That was far 

178
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,050
too high. We now set 

179
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,910
a limit of 5% for the first type of error. 

180
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,490
So now we have to go the 

181
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,160
other way. We 

182
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,520
don't know our interval now, 

183
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,020
but we do know our probability. 

184
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,040
This means that we will now 

185
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,640
set up two intervals. One is 

186
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,820
the interval for the null hypothesis 

187
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,400
and the other is the interval for the 

188
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,900
counter-hypothesis. One of the two 

189
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,960
intervals is of course always 

190
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,140
smaller and the other is of course 

191
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,320
always correspondingly larger. Which 

192
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
of these two intervals 

193
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,480
is the small one and which is the large 
one 

194
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,080
simply depends on the assertion 

195
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,760
. 

196
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,140
We can now see a small 

197
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,440
table here. This is 

198
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,420
about how you can assume H0. You 

199
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,700
can say that H0 means that 

200
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,220
more than 90% of cows 

201
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,840
give 2 liters of milk. Or you can set the 

202
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,300
null hypothesis exactly opposite 

203
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,480
and say that less than 90% 

204
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,720
of cows give 2 liters of milk . 

205
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,740
The 

206
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,500
intervals would shift accordingly. 

207
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,660
However, this is not the interval for our 

208
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,840
probability, but the 

209
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,860
interval for our sample. So 

210
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,040
if 0 to 89 cows give less than 2 

211
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,760
liters of milk, the 

212
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,200
opposite hypothesis would be confirmed. If 
more 

213
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,580
than 90 cows give 2 liters of milk 

214
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,280
, the null hypothesis would be confirmed. 

215
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,920
confirmed. 

216
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,200
Of course, we will set up a different 
interval in a moment. 

217
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,520
The opposite is true if 

218
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,020
we assume H0 such that less than 

219
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
90% of the cows give 2 liters of milk. 

220
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,660
If we then assume that from 0 to 89 cows 

221
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,780
give less than 2 liters of milk 

222
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,340
, H0 is confirmed and if from 90 to 100 

223
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,860
cows, i.e. more than 90 cows or 

224
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,680
at least 90 cows, 

225
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,460
give 2 liters of milk , then the 
counter-hypothesis HA is 

226
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,900
confirmed. So you can see that if you 

227
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,220

228
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,380
choose the null hypothesis H0 differently 
, HA and H0 are also 

229
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,120
interchanged or the two 

230
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,740
intervals are interchanged . 

231
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,340
We had just 

232
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,200
considered this case or decided to do so. 

233
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,020
We had a 

234
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,360
probability of 41.68% for HA and 

235
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,160
a probability of 58.3%. 2% 

236
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,400
for H0. 

237
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,980
Now we want to 

238
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,700
apply our significance level. 

239
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,180
This means that this is usually 

240
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,120
set to 5% or even 2%. This 

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,540
is also a common value. And 

242
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,640
we now say that we want to 

243
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,440
minimize the first type of error. 

244
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,540
In other words, we want to set the 

245
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,300
probability of 0 to K 

246
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,200
hits for HA to less than or equal to 5% 

247
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,600
and the probability of K plus 

248
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
1 to 100 hits, i.e. at least K 

249
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,680
plus 1 hits, to at least 95%. 

250
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,020
Simply so that we 

251
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,760

252
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,120
can make a meaningful statement. 

253
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,300
And we use this information to 

254
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,580
calculate a new interval. 

255
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,820
In other words, we don't take these two 

256
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,740
predefined intervals, we 

257
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,020
now calculate our own 

258
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,100
interval. This is the 

259
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,900
interval from 0 to K and the 

260
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,760
interval K plus 1 minus 100. This 

261
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,420
is often 

262
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,060
referred to as the decision rule as to 
whether we 

263
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,480
should believe the farmer or 

264
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,160
not. 

265
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,260
The calculation is actually 

266
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,720
quite simple. You simply look 

267
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,120
up the value from a table. 

268
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,440
You need the 

269
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,660
probability p, which in our case is 

270
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,340
0.9. The sample size, which 

271
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,820
in our case is 100. And then you look for 
the 

272
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,920
value where the condition 

273
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
is last fulfilled. In other words, from 0 
to k, 

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,560
that is the cumulative 

275
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,900
probability. In other words, we are 

276
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,960
looking for the cumulative 

277
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,860
probability for 100 trials 

278
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,600
with p equal to 0.9, for which 

279
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
the probability is less than 

280
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,420
or equal to 5%. 

281
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,100
Or, for the interval, 

282
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,520
yes, for which the 

283
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,060
probability is less than or equal to 5% 

284
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,560
. The table value will then give us 

285
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,020
a K of 84. The other 

286
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,240
possibility is, if you 

287
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,900
have a graphing calculator 

288
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,120
, you can 

289
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,900

290
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,480
have the cumulative probability 
automatically generated in a table and 
thus 

291
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,580

292
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,840
have the table that you find in the table 
work created using the calculator. 

293
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,120
In other words, we now know that we 

294
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,460

295
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,280

296
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,760
would opt for the counter-hypothesis up to 
and including 84 cows and from 85 cows we 
would opt 

297
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,840
for the H0 hypothesis and 

298
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,460
agree with the farmer. 

299
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,260
We have now 

300
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,760
formed the two intervals and that was 
already 

301
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,900
our decision rule. 

302
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,620
And we will now 

303
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,440
summarize the whole thing once again. In 

304
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,740
the hypothesis test , we are trying to 

305
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,220
confirm or refute an assertion . 

306
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,440
We have just created this 

307
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,020
decision rule for this purpose. The 

308
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,320
hypothesis test is simply based 

309
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,760
on trying to 

310
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,980
minimize the first type of error . That's 
what 

311
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,820
this 5% assumption is. And so 

312
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,000
you simply try to keep the 

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,880
mathematical probability of 

314
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,340
the counter-hypothesis low. 

315
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,060
And that is done, as I said, via 

316
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,980
the significance level. That was 

317
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,620
just the 5%. And based on 

318
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,120
this, you form the two 

319
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,860
intervals. 

320
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,020
Now the question is, and 

321
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,680
we have to be guided by how the 

322
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,340
assertion is designed. that 

323
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,640
either, i.e. if we 

324
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,960
have a large p% or a small p%, then 

325
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,440
our null hypothesis H0 is either 

326
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920

327
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680

328
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120

329
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,580
assigned to the larger interval and thus 
of course inevitably the 
counter-hypothesis is assigned to the 
smaller interval, or H0 is 

330
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,540

331
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,800
assigned to the smaller interval and HA is 
thus assigned to the larger interval. 

332
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,100
In other words, I think this is 

333
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,600
logical, we can only either 

334
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,920
give the hand a null hypothesis, 

335
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,060
or we give the counter-hypothesis the 

336
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,040
large interval. The question is 

337
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,580
, of course, how do you choose this or 

338
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,100
in which case do you give the 

339
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,260
null hypothesis the small interval. 

340
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,200
We have 

341
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,620
extended our question for this purpose. 
Namely, how does 

342
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,280
the hypothesis test change if I 

343
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,900

344
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,420
want to confirm the farmer 's assertion ? 
As on the last 

345
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,340
slide, we always assumed 

346
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,400
that the farmer wanted to confirm this 

347
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,880
. but a 

348
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
quality controller . And this 

349
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,480
quality controller wants to 

350
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,080
disprove this assertion. At the moment 

351
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,960
when the quality controller 

352
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
wants to disprove the assertion 

353
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,860
, he decides in favor of the lower 

354
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,620
case. For him, H0 is the case where 

355
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,680
less than 90% of the cows 

356
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,600
give 2 liters of milk. And now the upper 

357
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
interval... In other words, we 

358
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,000
now minimize the interval for 

359
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,200
the counter-probability or for 

360
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,160
the counter-hypothesis. 

361
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,270
The thought process is exactly the 

362
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,670
same . We now take the 

363
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,030
interval k plus 1 to 100 and this 

364
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,230
should be less than or equal to 5%. 

365
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,530
We read this probability 

366
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,350
from our table book again. 

367
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,110
But for this to work, we need 

368
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,290
at least k plus 1 hits and 

369
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,030
unfortunately you won 

370
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,370
't find at least hits in a set of tables, 
because the 

371
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,750
set of tables only contains the cumulative 

372
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,770
probability, which is the 

373
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,330
maximum. This means that if we have 

374
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,110
at least 

375
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,190
k hits is less than or equal to 5%, then 

376
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,750
we have 1 minus 

377
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,430
at most k hits up to k, i.e. from 0 

378
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,990
to k. You can use this 

379
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,550
arithmetic operation to turn this interval 

380
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,370
k plus 1 to 100 into the interval 0 to 

381
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,450
k. This is the . This is the cumulative 

382
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,270
probability. 

383
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,490
Smallness 

384
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,930
can be read from tables. The important 
thing 

385
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,570
is that it must now be greater than or 
equal to 95% 

386
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,290
. This means that we now read off 

387
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,430
when the probability exceeds 95% 

388
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,070
or 

389
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,170
is exactly 95% for the first time. We then 
arrive at a 

390
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,550
value of 95, which means that our K 

391
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,610
in this case is 95. And so we can 

392
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,630

393
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,550
determine our two intervals again. The 
interval for the 

394
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,870
null hypothesis then ranges from 0 to 

395
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,830
95 The interval for the 

396
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,350
counter hypothesis ranges from 96 to 100 

397
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,430
As a reminder, in the case of the 

398
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,370
counter hypothesis HA we would 

399
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,450
agree with the farmer The null hypothesis 
is 

400
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,710
that less than 90% of cows 

401
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,670
give 2 liters of milk And now we are 

402
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,210
faced with a small problem The farmer 

403
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,630
would take the above interval. For 

404
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,870
him, the H0 hypothesis is fulfilled at 

405
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,410
85 to 100. That is, he then says 

406
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,810
H0 hypothesis more than 95 percent of the 
cows 

407
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,630
give two liters of milk and his 

408
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,610
counter-hypothesis would be that less than 

409
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,410
90 percent give two liters of milk, 

410
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:38,790
would be from 0 to 84. The inspector 

411
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,070
of course looks at the other 

412
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,810
side. He wants to 

413
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,030
contradict the building or 

414
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,070
refute his assertion. That is why he has 

415
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,310

416
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,530
set his null hypothesis H0 exactly 
opposite. He simply says that 

417
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,050
less than 90% of the cows give 2 

418
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,110
liters of milk and thus arrives at an 

419
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,990
interval for his H0 hypothesis 

420
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,810
of 0 to 95. As a reminder, these 

421
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,410
two are exactly opposite. 

422
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,310
He only accepts his counter-hypothesis 

423
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,850
for 96 to 100 cows that produce more than 
2 

424
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,330
liters of milk. And now we are 

425
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,290
faced with the problem of assuming 

426
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,910
that three random samples were 

427
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,210
taken. The result is that 88, 

428
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,290
74 and 96 cows give more than two liters 

429
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,910
of milk. If we 

430
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,350
look at the 74 cows , then both are 

431
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,490
in agreement . The farmer would have his 

432
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,090
counter-hypothesis, i.e. he would 

433
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,850
also agree that less than 90% 

434
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,030
of the cows give two liters of milk. And 

435
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,430
the inspector would also be in his 

436
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,930
area. And see his statement 

437
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,890
confirmed. In other words, he 

438
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,010
contradicted him. So his 

439
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,790
null hypothesis is confirmed. Less 

440
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,070
than 90% of cows give 2 liters of milk. 

441
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,970
So they would both agree. 

442
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,430
The situation is different at 96. 

443
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,110
Or rather, it looks the same 

444
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,310
at 96. The farmer would say that his 

445
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,470
null hypothesis is confirmed. 90% 

446
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,250
of his cows produce more than 2 liters 

447
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,810
of milk. The inspector sees his 

448
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,670
counter-hypothesis confirmed. He has to 

449
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,310
realize that the farmer is right. 

450
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,970
Because, according to him, more than 

451
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,330
90% of the cows give 2 liters of milk, 
because 

452
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,910
he also has to 

453
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,150
switch to his counter-hypothesis , or his 

454
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,010
interval for his counter-hypothesis 

455
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,210
, which proves the farmer right, 

456
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,410
also contains the 96%. This means 

457
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,190
that they both agree again. The problem 

458
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,610
is now with the 88%. The farmer sees 

459
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,790
his statement confirmed, because the 88 

460
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,330
lies in his interval for the 

461
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,450
H0. In other words, the farmer says, okay, 

462
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,130
more than 90% of the cows produce more 
than 

463
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,570
2 liters of milk. 

464
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,250
But the inspector also sees his statement 
confirmed and 

465
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,030
says that less than 90% of the cows 

466
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,790
produce 2 liters of milk. In other words, 
at this 

467
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,070
point they disagree and 

468
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,910
it's a question of perspective. 

469
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,010
And that brings us to 

470
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,430
the important questions. to remember how 

471
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,790
to accept the H0 or HA hypothesis. 

472
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,390
It is very important that you 

473
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,810
read the task carefully and then make 

474
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,270
a reasoned 

475
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,650
decision as to which 

476
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,470
hypothesis you accept. 

477
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,580
There is often an assertion in the text 

478
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,860
and I would say 

479
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,120
that the 

480
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,660
hypothesis test 

481
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,300

482
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,640
should always be carried out in opposition 
to the statement. In other words, you 
always slip 

483
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,740
into the role of this controller. You 

484
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,060
try to disprove it. 

485
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,850

486
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,390
The H0 hypothesis, 

487
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,410
or the interval, is then determined by 
this inequality sign. And 

488
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,340
you can see that again here. 

489
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,870
once h0 goes from 0 to k and once 

490
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,890
h8 goes from 0 to k and, as 

491
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,850
I said, that is 

492
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,570
determined by the greater than or less 
sign , i.e. that is greater than or equal 
to and 

493
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,190
that is less than or equal to here we see 
once 

494
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,350
less than or equal to and greater than and 

495
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,920
we then 

496
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,200
always have our five percent 

497
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,820
significance level here, which is, as I 
said, 

498
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,080
very important that you 

499
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,440
also 

500
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,080
read out the significance level with that 
, which can or, as I said, 

501
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,020
that cannot be common, 5 

502
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,560
or 2%, although I 

503
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,320
would say that 5% 

504
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,280
is still a lot more popular than 2%. 

505
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,480
So that's it for the 

506
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,920
webinar. I hope you enjoyed 

507
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,520
the webinar and thank you 

508
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,560
very much for your 

509
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,340
attention.
