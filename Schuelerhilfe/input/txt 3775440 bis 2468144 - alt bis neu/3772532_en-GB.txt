00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,740
Hello again, Enes. If you 

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,100
can hear me now, just 

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,460
drop me a line in the chat. 

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,040
Top. Right, this is the last 

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,500
webinar today, on the topic of 

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,240
stochastics, multi-stage 

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,420
random experiments. And 

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,700
at the beginning there is a general 
introduction, 

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,300
what are multistage 

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,880
random experiments. 

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,880

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,240
We will 

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,060
look at three different types of random 
experiments , namely the ear model, 

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,320
the tree diagram and the four-field 

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,600
table. What are multistage 

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,160
random experiments? Multi-stage 

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,980
random experiments refer to the 

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,080
successive execution of multiple 

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,320
random experiments that 

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,920

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,240
are combined into a single random 
experiment. I think 

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,520
this is also clear once again. It becomes 
clearer 

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,640
when we 

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,140
look at the example of tossing a coin . A 
coin can be tossed 

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,560
several times in succession 

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
. 

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,980
The question arises as to how high the 

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,840
probability 

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,340
is for a certain constellation. 

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,500
For example, heads, tails, tails. 

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,620
However, if you only have four tosses 

32
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,440
at your disposal. 

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,640
So let's take a look at the first model 

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,760
. This is the urn model. The 

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,900
urn model is a so-called 

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,600
thought experiment. 

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,660
Imagine an urn with balls in it. 

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,280
Each ball has the same 

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,000
probability of being drawn. 

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,360
So if you 

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
see twelve balls there , then the 

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,160
probability of a 

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,520
particular ball being drawn is 

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,640
one twelfth. So assuming 

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,140
that 

46
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,040
there are any number of balls in the urn , 
of which you 

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,720

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
can draw any number , but it must not be 
greater 

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,660
than the total number of balls 

50
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,820
in there, there are 

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,640
a few things that 

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,960
can vary. This can be, for example, the 

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,040
color or something else in 

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
the order or 

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,200
variation of how the balls 

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,020
are to be drawn. 

57
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,420
There are four ways to do this. 

58
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,480
You can draw the balls and then 

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,800
put them back, but you also have to 

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,220
pay attention to the order. You 

61
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,760
can draw with putting the balls back 
without observing the 

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,460
order. You can 

63
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,820
draw without 

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,440
putting the balls back into the urn 

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,340
, but also observing the order. 

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,640
and you can draw without 

67
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,960
putting the ball back and without 

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,700
observing the order. So there are 

69
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,500
four different possibilities. The 

70
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,200
whole thing can also be 

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,100

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,680
illustrated again using a cross table as 
below , where you also 

73
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,640
have again with putting back, with 
observing order and without observing 
order and exactly the 

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,740
same for the variant without 

77
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,480
putting back, with observing 

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
order and without observing 

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,110
order. Let's take a look at 

80
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,330
the first variant, 

81
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,230
i.e. the draw with putting back with 

82
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,150
observing order. 

83
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,690
This means that the balls you 

84
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,490
have drawn are put back into 

85
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,970
the urn after the draw. It is important 

86
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,910
that a sequence is 

87
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,510
maintained. So we 

88
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,870
want to draw one blue ball and then two 

89
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,670
red balls. N therefore 

90
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,690
always remains 12 and the order must 

91
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,110
be blue, red, red. 

92
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,650
However, you can also 

93
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,310
vary the whole thing by 

94
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,930
drawing a blue, a green or a red ball 

95
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,660
and putting it back. 

96
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,680
However, you can also 

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,380
interpret the whole thing in such a way 
that you do the 

98
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,840
whole thing by putting it back , but 
without 

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,380
observing the order. So you 

100
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,100
should draw one blue ball and then two red 

101
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,760
balls. So it doesn't matter whether you 

102
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,240

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,340
draw the blue ball at the beginning, in 
the middle or at the start or whether you 

104
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,240

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,640
draw the two balls one after the other , 
last, at the beginning or 

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,740
alternately by 

107
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,520

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,900
drawing a red, a blue and then a red ball 
. It's exactly the same again 

109
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,660
for a blue, a 

110
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,460
green and a red ball. This means 

111
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,080
that each color can be drawn at the 
beginning 

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,900
, but it can also be drawn in the 

113
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,160
middle or at the end. 

114
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
And here too, the order is completely 

115
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,660
different, so blue, green 

116
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,420
or red can be in the middle, 

117
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,280
green, red, blue in the middle or 

118
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
red, green, blue at the end. 

119
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,070
Now draw the balls without putting them 
back and 

120
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,650
observing the order. 

121
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,230
This means that the balls are 

122
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,510
removed from the urn when they are drawn. 
If you have 

123
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,650
drawn a blue ball, it is 

124
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,250
no longer put back and the 

125
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,230
number of balls still in 

126
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,450
your urn 

127
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,370
is subtracted minus 1. This means that if 
you 

128
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,710
had 12 balls in it at the start and 

129
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,030
then drew a blue 

130
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,270
one, this will also be removed. 

131
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,930
If you only have 11 

132
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,710
balls left on your next turn and you have 
drawn a red one 

133
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,490
, you will only have 

134
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,710
10 balls left. So n is 

135
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,350
always 

136
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,690
reduced by the number of balls drawn and 
the order 

137
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,430
here should be blue-red-red 

138
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,330
Exactly the same scheme again 

139
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,130
for blue-green-red and then 

140
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,990
drawing without putting back and without 

141
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,250
observing the order And 

142
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,870
here too it is basically the same again 

143
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,010
, except that the number of 

144
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,750
balls that are then in the urn 

145
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,150
is always 

146
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,150
subtracted by 1 

147
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,460
Why do we need these four 

148
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,920
different 

149
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,580
variation options? There are 

150
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,060
tasks where a 

151
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,840
certain order is required 

152
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,480
and others where the 

153
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,480
order does not matter. The same 

154
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
really applies to the 

155
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,300
procedure when you 

156
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,260
have to put the ball back. So you 

157
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,440
really need to read through exactly what 
the 

158
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
task requires of you 

159
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,280
in order to 

160
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,580
recognize the correct variation. 

161
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,320
Let's continue with the 

162
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,600
tree diagram. 

163
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,180
In my opinion, the tree diagram is 
somewhat easier 

164
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,120
than the ear method. The 

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,760
multi-stage 

166
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
probability experiment can be 

167
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,660

168
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,200
illustrated particularly well with the 
help of the tree diagram. Let's take a 
look 

169
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,840
at the example of the 

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,680
coin toss. We have 

171
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,380
three tosses of a coin and in the 

172
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,080
diagram K stands for heads and Z for 

173
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,380
tails. And the numbers in the diagram 

174
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,280
each describe the 

175
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,540
probability of the toss. This 

176
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,720
means that on the first toss I have a 

177
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,400
50% probability of throwing tails or 

178
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,060
heads. Now that I 

179
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,720
have thrown tails or heads, I have 

180
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,000
a 50% probability 

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,460
of throwing tails or heads again . And 
that's how 

182
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,860
it all adds up. 

183
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,190
First of all, there are generally two 

184
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,970
rules for the tree diagrams. The 

185
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,210
first path rule says the 

186
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,590
probabilities along a 

187
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,530
path are multiplied. So 

188
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,010
if I 

189
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,370

190
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,370
want to look at the probability of the 
sequence number, number, number, I have to 

191
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,590
calculate 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5. 0.5 
times 0.5 is 0 

192
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,590
.25 and 0.25 times 0.5 is 

193
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,150
0.125. This means that the 

194
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,830
probability 

195
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,130
of throwing the sequence number, number, 
number is 

196
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,370
12.5%. And 

197
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,090
at the end, the 

198
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,610
probabilities of a path are 

199
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,570
then added together. So the 

200
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,630
probability of throwing tails twice and 

201
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,130
heads once is 

202
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,150

203
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,930
calculated with the paths tails, tails, 
heads, tails, heads, tails, tails. So you 
have to 

204
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,410

205
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,930
calculate 0.5 to the power of 3 times 3. 
So 0.5 times 0 

206
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,150
.5 times 0. 0.5 plus 0.5 times 0.5 times 0 

207
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,750
.5 plus 0.5 times 0.5 times 0.5 or 0 

208
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:11,350
.125 times 3 and that gives you 

209
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,510
0.375. So you have a 37.5 

210
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,970
% probability for this 

211
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,790
constellation. 

212
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,500
Finally, let's take a look at the 4-square 

213
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,900
 table. A 4-field 

214
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,480
 table is a table 

215
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,800
that 

216
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
is used in statistics or stochastics 

217
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,780
when it comes to the correlation between 
two 

218
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,140
events. 

219
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,000
In principle, there is another term for 
this 

220
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,300
, especially if you look at it in 

221
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,620
statistics. This is the 

222
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,100
term correlation, i.e. to 

223
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,960
investigate relationships. 

224
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,540
However, you will probably 

225
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,200
not have dealt with this at school 

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,500
or will not deal with it. 

227
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,400
Let's take a look at this 

228
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,220
example. A school has 830 

229
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,240
pupils, 428 of whom are female. 

230
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,600
Of the girls, 28%, i.e. 103 

231
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,580
pupils out of the 428, 

232
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,520
play soccer regularly. And 

233
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,180
43% of the 402 boys play football. 

234
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh, right, of the boys 

235
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:29,420
43% play soccer, 

236
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,760
that would be 173 pupils. And the values 
can be 

237
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,800

238
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,120
represented in this table as follows. So 
you have 

239
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,980
soccer and 

240
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,000
no soccer in the leftmost column. In the 
second 

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,540
column you have boys and girls, uh boys, 

242
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,860
in the second, uh in the third 

243
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,380
column girls and in the column 

244
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,680
on the far right, you have 

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,220
the number of 

246
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,900
soccer players in the second row at the 
bottom , then below that the 

247
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,160
number who do not play soccer and 

248
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,500
in each case at the bottom right the total 
number 

249
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,440
of pupils. 

250
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,680
So 

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,740
all you have to do now is transfer what 
you can 

252
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,940
see there. So with the 

253
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,540
173 here we have the boys who 

254
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,760
play soccer. With the 103 we have the 

255
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
girls who play soccer and 

256
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,140
at the bottom we have the total number 

257
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,440
of boys, which is 402 pupils and 

258
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
we have 428 girls, the 

259
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,500
total number of female pupils 

260
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,320
and we have a total of 

261
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,980
830 pupils at the bottom. 

262
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,040
So if we now 

263
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,700
want to calculate the number of boys who 

264
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,240
do not play soccer, we have to 

265
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,060
calculate 402 minus 173 

266
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,380
to arrive at our total of boys who 

267
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,020
do not play soccer. Exactly the 

268
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,960
same for the girls. 

269
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,420
However, if we now 

270
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,200

271
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,500
want to calculate the number of boys and 
girls who play soccer, 

272
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,680
we only have to add 173 plus 103. 

273
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,360
We then get the following picture: 

274
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
229 boys do not play 

275
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,200
soccer and 325 girls 

276
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,080
do not play soccer either. However, we 
have 

277
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,360
273 out of 830 

278
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,100
pupils who play soccer. Now we are 

279
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,460
only missing the last figure 

280
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,060
, namely the number of pupils 

281
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,720
who do not play soccer 

282
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,980
, which is 229 plus 325 

283
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,780
pupils and that 

284
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,220
makes 554 pupils. 

285
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,240
This means that more than half of the 

286
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,100
boys and girls at the school 

287
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,500
do not play soccer and the boys 

288
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
and girls who do play soccer 

289
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560

290
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,200
make up a slightly smaller proportion. 

291
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,050
Do you have a question about 

292
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,010
any of the topics presented? Okay, 

293
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,910
if that's not the case, 

294
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,170
then thank you again 

295
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,670
for your attention and 

296
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,930
have a nice weekend.
