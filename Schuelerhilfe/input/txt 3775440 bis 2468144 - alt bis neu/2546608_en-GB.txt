00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,560
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,600
Schülerhilfe webinar. 

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,240
Today we will be looking at the topic of 

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,260
dictionaries. In other words, we will look 

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,140
at what the term 

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,020
dictionary means, 

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,460
then we will ask ourselves what 

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,440
a dictionary is used for, 

9
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,960
then we will 

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,360
look at how to 

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,940
use a dictionary , then we will look 

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,360
at the signs of special 

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,720
meaning in a dictionary 

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,920
and finally we will look at how to 

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,400

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,980
find the right meaning for a word . In 
other words, we will 

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,080
look at the method of 

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,220
finding a suitable 

19
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,280
meaning for a word quickly and easily. 

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
Let's start with the general 

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,820
concept of a dictionary. 

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,660
First and foremost, a dictionary is 

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,680
a reference work. This means that it is 

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,340
an information overview of 

25
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,560
words that 

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,100
contains an alphabetically sorted list. 

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,820
In other words, this information overview 

28
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,200
consists of an alphabetically 

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,940
sorted list. This is called 

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,060
a dictionary. In addition to this 

31
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,940
list of words, a 

32
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,120
dictionary also contains external texts. 

33
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,340
This means user notes, 

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,240
lists of abbreviations and 

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,720
inflection tables. A inflection 

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,300
is ultimately the inflection of a 

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,200
word. This means that with nouns 

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,160
and adjectives we 

39
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,320

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,860
are dealing with declension classes and 
declensions and with verbs with 

41
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,340
conjugation classes and 

42
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,680
conjugation sequences. In addition to 
these 

43
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,340
three, there 

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,100
are of course others, such 

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,780
as an appendix with 

46
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,200
idioms . We know Al-Jalak das 

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,280
Est as an excellent example 

48
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,320
of what Latin 

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,120
idioms are, for example, or Carpe Diem, 

50
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
who said it, in what 

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,060
context it is connected. This gives 

52
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,600
us additional 

53
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,980
information. In other words, external 
texts 

54
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,420
provide us with further 

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,100
information in addition to the actual 

56
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,180
core of the book, namely the 

57
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,300
dictionary. In addition to the 

58
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,940
general paperbacks and 

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,260
reference works in print, i.e. 

60
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,900
the printed version, there 

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,220
are also online dictionaries. 

62
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,740
Let us now ask ourselves what 

63
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,200
this 

64
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
information actually means . Well, it is 

65
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,860
information about the language, 

66
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,320
which means that a language dictionary is 
a 

67
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,860
dictionary. This means that we can 

68
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,880

69
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,220
find out linguistic information , 
information such as 

70
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,620
spelling, 

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,280
pronunciation or 

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,060
grammatical properties, such as 

73
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,400
word type and genus. 

74
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,780
We have already talked about the term 
deflection 

75
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,700
and have also 

76
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,500
briefly mentioned why it is important to 

77
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,900

78
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,680
know the origin and meaning of a word. In 
other words, we 

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,540
need to look at where it comes from, when 

80
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,280
it is used and this 

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,060
ultimately leads us to 

82
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,600
the usage background and the 

83
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,760
translation possibilities . Because as 

84
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,920
most people know, 

85
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,020
Italian, sorry, 

86
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,360
Latin words usually have several 

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,780
possible translations into 

88
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,300
German and we therefore always have to 

89
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,940
check which is the correct 

90
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,020
translation and when we 

91
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,140
have to use which translation. 

92
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,880
This means that it is highly advisable to 

93
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,160

94
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160

95
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,220
look up and understand the usage notes and 
the translation options as well . 

96
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,220
Now we come to the question of why 

97
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,120
we use a dictionary. 

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,500
First and foremost , we want to 

99
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,900

100
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,880
find out the meaning of a word , i.e. 

101
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,540
find out possible translations. 

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,060
In addition to this, we can 

103
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,380

104
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,180

105
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,480
find out about the spelling, pronunciation 
and, as mentioned, the idiom and also 

106
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,340

107
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,260

108
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,760
find certain example situations for the 
use and occurrence of the word, as well as 
how it is used. 

109
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,200
When we look at 

110
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,840
dictionary use, 

111
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,440
we started by asking ourselves, 

112
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,520
how do I use my dictionary? 

113
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,000
In other words, my aim is to 

114
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,580
look up information quickly 

115
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,740
and find it specifically. 

116
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,780
In other words, I have to remind myself, 

117
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,240
once again, that we 

118
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,080
have a dictionary here , i.e. 

119
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,820
an alphabetically sorted list, 

120
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,840
as we have already established, which 

121
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,680
we just want to use. How do we use 

122
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,700
it best? We use it so 

123
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,280
that if we 

124
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,260
want to search for the word vowels, for 
example, we don't 

125
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,660
start at A, but we limit 

126
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,060
our search radius as much as possible 

127
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,420
. In other words, we don't look at 

128
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,760
A, but at V. Now 

129
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,180
we don't start 

130
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,400
looking at the words with VA, but at the 

131
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,800
words with VO. In addition, 

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,640
we narrow down the word even further 

133
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,320
by saying that we are only looking for 

134
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
words with VOK. And we soon arrive 

135
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,720
at the word we are looking for, 

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,220
namely the verb Vokare, which we 

137
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,780
find there under VOKO. More on 

138
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,180
why it doesn't say Vokare 

139
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,360
but VOKO later. And we have all the 

140
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,860
important information we 

141
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,560
need there. In addition, of course, we 
have 

142
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,420

143
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,300
to pay attention to keywords and key words 
, for all those who 

144
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,220
have searched for ag in the dictionary, 

145
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,840
we are redirected to the word 

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,820
adque and everything about the 

147
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,420
two words is explained there. 

148
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,600
In addition, we must also pay attention to 

149
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,980
words that are compound 

150
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,200
, because 

151
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,380
if we are careful, we will 

152
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,160
notice that we will 

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,660

154
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,540
never 

155
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,920
find the verb Transmittere under the, 
under the alphabet, in the alphabet under 
T, 

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,580
but we will always 

157
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,400
find it under Mittere, because it is a 
trans-, 

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,840
so the trans-, a so-called 

159
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,800
suffix, i.e. a prefix, i.e. a, 

160
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,300
sorry, because trans- 

161
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,600
is a prefix , i.e. a prefix, 

162
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,300
which means that with words that 

163
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,280
have a suffix or prefix, i.e. a prefix 

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,140
 or suffix, we 

165
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,540
always have to concentrate on the core of 
the word 

166
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,180
and look it up. So 

167
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,620
, as I said, we find 

168
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,340
the word 

169
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,680
Transmittere with mittere and not with T. 
This is because not all 

170
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,360
word forms can be found in the dictionary 

171
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,960
. Sometimes we just find 

172
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,380
the word mittere 

173
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,340
and then find it in brackets 

174
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,700
, more on this later. Also the 

175
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,160
prefix. When we 

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,180
search for words, we should 

177
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,920
sometimes also 

178
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,580
search for keywords. This helps us to 

179
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,980
identify individual things. For example, 
if we 

180
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,500
have different conjunctions 

181
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,360
and we have a 

182
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,100
collection of conjunctions in the outside 
texts , it is 

183
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,660
sometimes easier to 

184
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,260
search in the table of conjunctions 

185
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,100
rather than in the large 

186
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,980
list of words. So if we 

187
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,800
want to go into how to 

188
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,340
search for forms quickly, we need to 

189
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,540
take a few things into account. We must 

190
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,680
always 

191
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,200
enter forms that are difficult to derive 
under extra entries. 

192
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,740
This means that if we 

193
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,360
have more difficult forms or 

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,940
are not satisfied with our search, we have 
to 

195
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,400
 look for extra  entries. And we must be 

196
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,460
aware that different 

197
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,300
word types also 

198
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,740
have different search methods. we 

199
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,880
always find nouns in the nominative case 
and 

200
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,140
the genitive singular ending as well as 

201
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,280
the indication of the gender. This means 
that if we 

202
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,580
take the example of amica, we would find 

203
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,260
amica, amica, F-dot for 

204
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,460
feminine and could deduce from this 

205
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,640
that it belongs to the A declension. This 

206
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,020
is 

207
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,400
necessary for us in the later translation, 
because there are 

208
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,320
many forms - I'll 

209
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,840
refer you to our webinar 

210
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
on the declension of nouns that 

211
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,760
have endings of the same form. This means 
that 

212
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,720
it is not always clear 

213
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,940
which case we are dealing with here. 

214
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,860
And so we can't 

215
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,200
find out exactly which 

216
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,160
declension class it is. In other words, 

217
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,620
which declension we have 

218
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,000
, i.e. which case we have. To avoid this 

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,860
, all 

220
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,100
nouns are always given in the most 
important 

221
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,920
forms, i.e. in the nominative and 

222
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,300
genitive singular with their 

223
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,940
genus. It is similar with adjectives. 

224
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,900
Adjectives are only given in the 
nominative case 

225
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,880
. However, 

226
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,580
all forms are given, 

227
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,540
such as in the case of three-ending 
adjectives 

228
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,720
bonus, bonar, bonum. Not 

229
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,860
only masculine is indicated, but also 

230
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,040
feminine and neuter. In the case of 
adjectives 

231
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,820
with two or one endings 

232
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,920
, we ultimately only find the 

233
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,880
fourth stem, which is 

234
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,500
usually expressed in masculine . 

235
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,360
Three NDA adjectives are 

236
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,980
declined in the A and O declension 

237
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
, we can learn this conclusively from the 

238
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,620
fact that we have Bonus 3, that 

239
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,460
is, we can know, aha, it 

240
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,800
is called Bonus Bonabonum, that is, in the 

241
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,440
actual entry we only find 

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
the nominative singular masculine, 

243
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,200
Bonus, yes, US ending masculine and 

244
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,720
then a 3 and know, aha, Aha, 

245
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,440
feminine and neuter are formed according 
to the 

246
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,200
out-o-declension 

247
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,400
, for example, whereas the two-finders 

248
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,860
are formed in the consonantal 

249
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,640
for example. Verbs have a very 

250
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,380
special form and, as 

251
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,860
I have just briefly mentioned , verbs 

252
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,340
are either in the infinitive or in 

253
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,020
the first person singular indicative 

254
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,420
present active. This means that 

255
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,960
we don't usually find vowels in the 

256
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,840
infinitive, but rather under Voko. 

257
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,160
This means that Voco and in green in 1. 1 

258
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,260
means A conjugation or we 

259
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,240
can 

260
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,260

261
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,940
deduce from the first person singular, 
indicative, present active that it is the 
A conjugation 

262
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,840
. For example, if we were looking for 
audire 

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,120
, we would have specified audio and 

264
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,860
would know that it belongs to the I 
declension 

265
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,020
because we have the I as a binding. 

266
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,180
With Capere , it would be 

267
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,280
Capere Capio and we would know that it 

268
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,340

269
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,880

270
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,160
belongs to the mixed conjugation with an 
I-extension . With Agere Ago, that means 

271
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,980
we would know, aha, it is the 

272
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,160
mixed conjugation. 

273
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,960
It is always important 

274
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,860
to read all entries to the end and to 

275
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,160
study them thoroughly so that we 

276
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,040

277
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,220

278
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,880
can apply and know all the information 
that could be helpful later in our 
translation. 

279
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,860
Now we come to the signs of 

280
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,080
particular importance that we 

281
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,620
can use in the dictionary. 

282
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,240
On the one hand, this is the stress, 

283
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,000
namely the dot and the dash 

284
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,500
below a word is either an 

285
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,640
emphasized shortness, if it is a dot, 

286
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,300
like Abiturient, or a dash 

287
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,920
below a vowel for an 

288
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,640
emphasized length. 

289
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,220
For example, we now have Abitur. This is 

290
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,040
important insofar as we have these 

291
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,940
dashes, depending on 

292
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,840
which dictionary we use. 

293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,140
Some dictionaries also write 

294
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,720
a 

295
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,000
length mark or an emphasized 

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,860
shortness point above the vowels . This 
allows us to 

297
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,940
find out, for example, that Kasus, 

298
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,000
Kasus comes from the U declension 

299
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,060
because it has the elongated U. 

300
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,240
Or it has the emphasized, stressed long U. 

301
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,540
Square brackets, i.e. the content of the 

302
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,880
square brackets describes the 

303
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,500
pronunciation, i.e. it 

304
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
tells us how 

305
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,820
to pronounce the word , which means 

306
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,220
we need to know the phonetic 
transcription. 

307
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,100
Round brackets give us explanatory 

308
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,680
additions, for example, if we 

309
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,120

310
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,340
want to go back to the example from before 
, mittere 

311
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,180
, we would then have trans as a prefix and 

312
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,080
would know, aha, so that is an 

313
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
addition that we 

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,500

315
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,280
could add to the word , i.e. we 

316
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,720
could append it to the word . Equals signs 
mean 

317
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,360
that the word has the same meaning, 

318
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,880
just like a slash says that 

319
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,540
both are possible. So on the one hand 

320
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,580
it has the same meaning, on the other hand 

321
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,140
you can say that both are possible. 

322
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,140
Of course, it depends on 

323
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,280
the translation and the sentence, 

324
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,880
on the contextual connection. 

325
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,200
Vertical lines mark the 

326
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,580
hyphenation of words. 

327
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,580
Abbreviations are also very 

328
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,780
important, as there is a 

329
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,640
lot 

330
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,760
of information in a dictionary 

331
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,380
and abbreviations are usually used 

332
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,980
to save as much space as possible. 

333
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,540
There are important abbreviations 

334
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,240
such as adjective, i.e. adjectival, 

335
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,980
abbreviated, aliquid, dative, feminine, 

336
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,660
common, contrast, 

337
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,260
interjection, intransitive, masculine 

338
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,540
, neuter, post-classical, secondary form, 

339
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,400
poetic. Adjective, reflexive, 

340
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,380
substantive, transitive 

341
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,180
, original, pre-classical, for 

342
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,040
example, context or simultaneous. 

343
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,640
We need to know that 

344
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,840
adjectival, as the name suggests 

345
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,360
, is to be seen as abbreviated, or 

346
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,980
aliquid or the dative 

347
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,640
is to be seen as dative . Feminine 

348
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,160
, of course, means that it is feminine 

349
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,680
, just as masculine and neuter 

350
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,240
are abbreviated as such, because 

351
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,260
this is the translation that is commonly 
used. 

352
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,980
In contrast, 

353
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,780
interjection is an exclamation . 

354
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,800
Intransitive means that the verb does not 
need an 

355
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,620
object. Secondary forms are 

356
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,620
things, other forms that we 

357
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,560

358
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,200
can use in addition to this verb or this 
word. 

359
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Poetically, it can be translated like 
this. 

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,940
Reflexive means that it 

361
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,520
refers back to the subject in question. 

362
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,940
Substantive means something 

363
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,860
that 

364
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,280
is translated more like a noun . 
Transitive 

365
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,860
means the reverse of intransitive 

366
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,560
, namely that an object is used. 

367
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,860
Originally it is to be used like this, 

368
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,580
pre-classically it is translated like 
this. For 

369
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,520
example, you can use it in this way 

370
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,860
to see in context or at the same time 

371
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,500
you can understand it in this way. So 

372
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,360
here we see the enlargement, which 

373
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,800
basically 

374
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,260

375
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,060
provides us with individual operators or 
individual additional information. Now we 
come 

376
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,620
to the synonyms. Synonyms are 

377
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,900
words with the same or very 

378
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,880
similar meanings. 

379
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,580

380
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,260
They have the same meaning, sense or 
usage, similarity 

381
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,020
or relationship. 

382
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,880
We can see this here with the verb fly. 

383
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,600
We can connote flying, 

384
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,380
i.e. associate it with the following 
things. 

385
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,380
Hover, glide, sail, buzz. 

386
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,880
Here we are talking about things 

387
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,000
that move above the earth. Then 

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,620
jet, roar, run, sprint, 

389
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
race, hurry. In other words, 

390
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
moving on the earth. Falling, flying, 

391
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
tumbling. That is, the movement from 

392
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,820
the straight to the horizontal. 

393
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,620
That is, falling to the earth, 

394
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
falling or flying to the earth, 

395
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,720
to the ground, then 

396
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,620
figuratively 

397
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,860
being dismissed , being fired, that 

398
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,680
is, losing one's job 

399
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,200
or metaphorically 

400
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,080
falling in love, falling out of love or 

401
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,780
being crazy about. In other words, we 

402
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,760
realize that flying 

403
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,580
can have different meanings and so 

404
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,220
we 

405
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,320
have individual verbs or especially verbs 

406
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,460

407
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,180
that can be translated in a very, very 
large number. 

408
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,160
This means that we always have to 

409
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,420
consider all possible synonyms 

410
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,640
and then 

411
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,380

412
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,480
check them against the context and the 
meaning of the sentence and choose the 

413
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,760
right one. In addition to 

414
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,880
synonyms, we must also distinguish between 
homonyms 

415
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,400
and antonyms. 

416
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,220
Homonyms are words with several 

417
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,240
possible meanings. 

418
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,720
This means that they 

419
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,920
depend on the intention of the statement 

420
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,060
. 

421
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,520
For example, homonyms could be light and 
bright. This 

422
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,260
refers to the same thing, but 

423
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,240
of course it has different 

424
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,260
meanings. In other words, they 

425
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,980
ultimately mean the same thing, but 

426
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,720
the possible interpretations are 
different. 

427
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,980
In other words, we have to take the 

428
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,540
intended meaning into account here. 

429
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,220
Antonyms are words with 

430
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,940
opposite meanings, such as light 

431
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,020
and dark. Now we come to the 

432
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,000
method of finding the right meaning for 

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,320
a word. We have 

434
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,600
already talked about the 

435
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
fact that we 

436
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,540
have to pay attention to many factors. And 
we see 

437
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,180
here, for example, the entry for 

438
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,160
their. So we can 

439
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,360

440
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,720

441
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,040

442
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,060
see their poetically, militarily or also 
legally in a different context, i.e. with 
a different summonym, i.e. different 
connotations. That is, their ad kellum, 

443
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,500
subsidiary, we can 

444
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,820
fly to heaven or come to the rescue, 

445
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,700
overlook. That is, poetically, that is 

446
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,620
, figuratively. In 

447
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,440
a military context, that is, 

448
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,420
if we are now talking about war, 

449
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,460
then belloere means 

450
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,100
to go to war, not to go to war 

451
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,780
. Or going through war. 

452
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,740
It has the fixed meaning of 

453
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,900
going to war. In legal terms, their 

454
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Injus, means to go to court or 

455
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,800
sangus naribus, it blotstromt from the 

456
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,040
nose. That is, legally 

457
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,920
we have to see it like this. The 

458
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,660
 poetic-military-legal are 

459
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,540
of course the adjectives 

460
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,920
to be assigned to the text. In other 
words, we 

461
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,420
have to use the translated text 

462
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,120
and also the introductory text to 

463
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
decide which situation we 

464
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,820
are dealing with here. 

465
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,240
The grammatical context is also 

466
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,040
important. We have to pay attention to the 

467
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,820
prepositions with different 

468
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,580
case reactions. In Villa or 

469
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,140
in Willam, on the one hand, there is 

470
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,140
a content preposition with an applicative 
or 

471
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,320
an accusative case. This means that we 
have 

472
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,100
, let's take the last 

473
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,860
example, in Willam their a verb of 

474
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,180
movement. In other words, here it is 

475
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,920
presumably an accusative of 

476
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,320
direction. This means that we have to 

477
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,560
translate it as go into the house or in 

478
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,060
Willam mal closer means 

479
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,500
stay in the house , because we have mal 
closer, 

480
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,880
we have to 

481
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,100
use the applativus loci here. This means 

482
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,320
that we always have to pay attention to 

483
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,300
which cases are used for prepositions 

484
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,020
and then check them. 

485
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,780
So here we don't have 

486
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,860
a nominative case for villa, but an 

487
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,300
applicative case, and for villa we 

488
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,640
clearly have an accusative case and have 
to 

489
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,740
translate it with a direction. The 

490
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,720
appropriate meaning can also be found 

491
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,400
in the epochs. This means 

492
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,380
that if we 

493
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,900
are dealing with classical poets and we 
have 

494
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,180
individual formulations that 

495
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,440

496
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,280
mean something different in post-classical 
terms , we know this by 

497
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,340

498
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,900
combining the translation with 
post-classical, 

499
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,980
such as whiteness or 

500
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,520
seeing the poetic usages as we 

501
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
have just understood them. 

502
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,940
In addition, there is the 

503
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,680
author's peculiarity, which means that 

504
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,840
an author 

505
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,760
translates it in a particular way , so we 
usually have 

506
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,300
the brevity, we see that here with 

507
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,680
Caesar, yes, and Caesar stands for it, 

508
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,040
for example, when we 

509
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,780

510
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,540
read reports from the Bellochivili, i.e. 
from the civil wars 

511
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,620
, it always says that Caesar 

512
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,820

513
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,080
translates it this way, i.e. Caesar 
translates it this way . or reading own 

514
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
phrases, authors' typical 

515
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,600
meanings, such as how 

516
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Detour in Zizor 

517
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
is always to be translated as It seems. Or 

518
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,140

519
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,700
phrases to be excluded from other authors. 
In other words, we realize 

520
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,740
that a dictionary gives us 

521
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,340
different information and 

522
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,840
basically provides us with the 

523
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,420
entire craft of 

524
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,620
translating texts correctly. 

525
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,580
Thank you for your attention. See 

526
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:29,820
you soon.
