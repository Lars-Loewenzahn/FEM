1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,080
So, welcome to 

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,260
the webinar today, although you is a 

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,700
bit of an exaggeration, just one person 

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,760
here. Yes, I welcome you or you welcome 
me. 

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,180
I hope you can understand me 

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,100
quite well so far. Perhaps 

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,760
you can 

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,740
give me some feedback in the chat to see 
if you can hear me. 

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,560
Then I'll know if I'm on the 

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,720
safe side. Okay, perfect. 

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,580
Thank you for your feedback. 

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,340
I would like to take this opportunity to 
introduce myself 

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,840
. My name is Kjell 

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,860
Polacek. I've been a 

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,240
tutor 

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,120
at Schülerhilfe since 2013. I 

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,000
am currently studying electrical 
engineering at the 

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,180
University of Aachen and teach 

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,300
mathematics, so I will be 

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,420
giving the student presentation on the 
graphing 

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,880
 calculator today. 

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,660
I have a question beforehand, and that is, 

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,020
if you would like to, 

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,160
you can write down briefly what your 

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,740
goals are for this course, whether you 

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,100
have any specific questions 

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,960
or whether this is simply 

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,880
intended as a general insight. Then I can 

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,420

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,180
prepare the content a little better. That 
would be 

31
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,860
good information for me. 

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,490
And yes, I'll wait a minute. 

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,230
Yes, 

34
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,170
all right, then I'll know. 

35
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,290
Yes, then I'll 

36
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,590
start the training right away and if you 

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,150
have specific questions or 

38
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,790
specific concerns, then you' 

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,550
re very welcome to ask them, because 

40
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,050
this webinar is primarily 

41
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,270
intended for students, but here we 

42
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,870
just want to give an overview and 

43
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,970
then we'll 

44
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,350
use the Texas Instruments Inspire. Well, 
then I would 

45
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,530
say I'll just start with 

46
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,090
the push and as I said, 

47
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,370
if you have any questions, 

48
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,470
please feel free to ask them or 

49
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,790
make suggestions or special requests 

50
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,370
and I can answer them. 

51
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,050
So, in this context, I will 

52
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,650
now start my screen sharing, 

53
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,590
because we also have a virtual 

54
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,930
version of the calculator here, 

55
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,510
so that we can also 

56
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,570
go through the individual tasks live 

57
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,150
, or depending on whether it 

58
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,190
is desired. so I'll 

59
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,310
just switch over there now. 

60
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,250

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,910
You should now be able to see my second 
screen. Can you 

62
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,070
perhaps briefly confirm whether you 

63
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,350
can see my mouse pointer here? 

64
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,310
I know that as soon as everything is 

65
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,650
working . Okay, 

66
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,240
great. Good, I'll start the 

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,140
presentation now. As I said, don't be 

68
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,120
surprised, this is a 

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,780
student webinar, so it's 

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,860
all 

71
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,100
aimed at students or trainees. First of 
all, 

72
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,700
a little motivation for this 

73
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,560
training. Why should it 

74
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
be invested at this time ? We have 

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,540
put together a few key points. 

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,180
First of all, a good command of 

77
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,900
the calculator saves time. The 

78
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,740
use of a calculator 

79
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,640
in school is compulsory, 

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,700
at least in many German 

81
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,300
federal states. 

82
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,040
This is certainly the 

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,100
case in NRW. And 

84
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,400
this is exactly the model that is used 
there, for example. But 

85
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,920

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,280
a graphing calculator or even 

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,420
CAS is also required in other federal 
states . And that's why it's 

88
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,120
important that you have 

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,740
enough time for the 

90
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,860
tasks during the exams so that you 

91
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,080

92
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,460
can cope reasonably well with the 
calculator . Yes, that's why it's 

93
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,500
a very big motivational point. Yes, 

94
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,540
the second point, we can 

95
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,260
combine it directly with this. It is 
important 

96
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,680
that others, including our 

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
students, gain confidence in 

98
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,880
working with it. This means that when 

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,500
a task like 

100
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,720

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,280
determining the zeros graphically , for 
example, progresses , you 

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,460
don't 

103
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,920
have to spend half an hour searching for 
the functionality in the 

104
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,440
computer, but 

105
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
can call up this function directly. 

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,180
Then clearly 

107
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,800
avoid sources of error during operation. 
That is very 

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,120
essential. And one consequence of 

109
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,460
all this is that homework 

110
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,080
can be completed more quickly. 

111
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,880
And this head start in knowledge 

112
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,560
often gives us an advantage in 

113
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,840
exams in general. That is 

114
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,220
a motivation. Yes. A 

115
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,340
graphing calculator like this. .. has a 

116
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,920
very wide range of functions and we're 

117
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,140
going to 

118
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,880

119
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,820
take a brief look at the navigation here 
in the webinar , or we're going to look at 
it together , how do 

120
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,160
I generally get 

121
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,980
on with the calculator . We'll also take a 
look 

122
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,280
at the settings menu, because 

123
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,080
you can 

124
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,520
or should definitely 

125
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,420
make some basic settings there so 

126
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,960

127
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,400
that you can get correct results later 
under certain circumstances. Then we will 

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,280

129
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,100

130
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,980
take a closer look at the concept between 
scratchpad and documents. When do I use 
one, 

131
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,260
when do I use the other? And yes, the 

132
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,520
last part is a bit 

133
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,540
summarized . I'll simply show you 

134
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,980
how to solve general problems with 

135
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,720
the calculator. 

136
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,360
In particular, zeros and 

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,140
integrals or, hence 

138
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,660
the name, graphing calculators 

139
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,560
, how you 

140
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,420
can display graphs, for example, and then 

141
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,920
analyze them. Okay, 

142
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,360
let's just start with the navigation. 

143
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,780
The main navigation on this model 

144
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,140
here is the Texas Instruments 

145
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,340
Inspire CX. This is the typical 

146
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,480
graphing calculator 

147
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,980
used at school and it has 

148
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,360
a touchpad in the middle or 

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,780
a touchpad integrated with 

150
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,600
arrow keys, which allows you to 

151
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,760

152
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,580
easily 

153
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,400
manage all the functions directly in the 
mouse pointer menu. This means that 

154
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
you can 

155
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,720

156
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,480
control a mouse pointer either by touching 
it with your finger. 

157
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,020

158
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,960
Of course, I can 't 

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,040
simulate this so easily here in this 
emulation . Here I 

160
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,580
simply use my mouse pointer, my 

161
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,780
physical mouse pointer, and 

162
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,800
I can also move it here. And 

163
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
I can then 

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
click on it, for example, to 

165
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,700
execute certain things. 

166
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,860
As I said, this works here with a 

167
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,860
touch field. Similarly, I can also 

168
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,940
use the arrow keys to 

169
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,360

170
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
select the individual items in this menu, 
for example. That 

171
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,500
also works. Likewise. 

172
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,620
The important thing is that if I 

173
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,300
want to confirm something, I press 

174
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,620
the button in the middle. In my case, 

175
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,620
I can do this simply by 

176
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,680
clicking the mouse, but 

177
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,960
in general, 

178
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,660
the whole thing works physically by 
pressing the 

179
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,760
middle button. Or, if you 

180
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,460
don't like working with it, you can 

181
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,340
also use the letters of the 

182
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,240
graphic calculator 

183
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,660
or the numbers to 

184
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,100

185
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,920
call up the menu items. For example, I can 

186
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,960
now use the letter A to 

187
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,060
calculate something directly in the 
scratchpad or 

188
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,300
the number 1 to 

189
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,780
create a new document. 

190
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,620
I'll just try to 

191
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:58,980
show you how. 

192
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,350
I'll go out here to do that. I 

193
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,490
don't know , I think the main menu is 

194
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:06,970
here now. 

195
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,320
That's right. Here I am 

196
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,540
now in the main menu, as we 

197
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,920
see it on the right. And now I could 

198
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,620
press the B button, for example. And 

199
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,080
I'm already in circle. Mode. 

200
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,120
Okay. 

201
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,510
Yes. Then, as we can see, there are 

202
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,150
two rough main menu items in 

203
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,030
this calculator. 

204
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,710
The first is the 

205
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,810
so-called scratchpad or a 

206
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,390
document. In other words, in addition to 
the 

207
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,810
other functionalities 

208
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,070
that are available, which we will also 

209
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,690
look at briefly in a moment, for example 

210
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,710
this menu item Geometry or 

211
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,510
Graph or Tables, you can 

212
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,490
generally 

213
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,330
perform general things here, for example 
simple 

214
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,630
calculations. And you can 

215
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,310
use this scratchpad, for example. 

216
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,630
The scratchpad is designed for 

217
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,750
when quick calculations 

218
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,810
are required or when you 

219
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,510

220
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,450
want to quickly analyze a graph. A special 
feature of the 

221
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,230
scratchpad is that it is not 

222
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,250

223
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,910
possible to save directly to your own 
files. And this is again 

224
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,490
possible in a document, with the help of 

225
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,310
a document I can then, for example, 

226
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,450

227
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,050
carry out a series of calculations and can 

228
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,910
save the whole thing. This means that I 
can 

229
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,950
open it again the next day and 

230
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,830
continue there if I want to. And 

231
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,470
what 

232
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,870
is also possible here in the Documents 
menu item are these 

233
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,890
settings. In other words, this 

234
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,770
settings menu can 

235
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,570
also be found here in the background. 

236
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,370
Documents, whether that makes sense 

237
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,030
or not is open to question, 

238
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,710
but they are definitely 

239
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,230
there. And I'd say 

240
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,370
we'll do that right here 

241
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,810
and just take a look at what 

242
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,270
settings you 

243
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,390
can make. Yes, let's 

244
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,090
just press button 5 and we'll be taken to 

245
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,730
a small 

246
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,770
menu where we can 

247
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,670
make a few settings directly. 

248
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,110
At this point, we can see very 

249
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,870
quickly that this window is different from 

250
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,010
the one here or from the one here 

251
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,310
. Why is that? When 

252
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,850
these recordings were made here, 

253
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,210
which was some time ago, 

254
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,670
I think two or three years ago, there 

255
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,730
was still this old 

256
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,670
operating system or the old 

257
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,710
firmware. That has now 

258
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,810
changed a bit, which is why we 

259
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,870
now also see additional 

260
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,570
menu items here , such as 

261
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,330
Restore factory defaults 

262
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,230
or a TI Innovator Hub, so that we 

263
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,870
know what that is. But the 

264
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,210
basic settings are there, of course. 

265
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,770
Yes, and here you first have to 

266
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,970
differentiate. You can 

267
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,910
change the language here, for example. 

268
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,430
For example, if you 

269
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,650

270
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,770
have somehow received a model from abroad 
, it may be that 

271
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,870
a different 

272
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,290
language is set here. So 

273
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,030
you can 

274
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,590
do this very quickly here. Then you can 

275
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,290
make document settings here. 

276
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,410
Yes, you can set parameters here, for 

277
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,290
example the number of 

278
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,650
decimal places for the 

279
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,490
output format, which is only possible in 

280
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,890
normal settings. You can also 

281
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,750
have a look here. Yes, 

282
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,470
we can see that here , for example. Here 

283
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,510
we can see the displayed digits. Yes, here 
we 

284
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,290
have this floating point format. 

285
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,010
Floating point means that we have a total 
of 

286
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,170
six digits, regardless of where 

287
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,010
the decimal place is. Here we can 

288
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,790
also see directly, and I think this is 

289
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,130
one of the most important settings, 

290
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,570
which angle measure we are using here. 

291
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,890
For example, we have 

292
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,530
set radians . 

293
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,110
But I can easily change that to degrees 
here. 

294
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,510
I think this is one of the 

295
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,570
most important settings, 

296
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,870
especially for our 

297
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,750
students 

298
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,970
, or degrees. 

299
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,010
This is now here in degrees. Then 

300
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,290
I can set the exponential format here 

301
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,670
, calculation mode and 

302
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,550
many other points, base, decimal, 

303
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,550
etc. These are the degrees. These are the 
formal 

304
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,690
settings for the documents. That 

305
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,030
is important. 

306
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,640
Otherwise there is this 

307
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,500
sub-item Setting up the handheld. 

308
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,420
This is the 

309
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,300
start sequence when you 

310
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,660
start this GTR for the first time , the 

311
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,680
factory settings. You can 

312
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,020
then 

313
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,300
make all the general settings there, such 
as the 

314
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,040
duration of standby or the 

315
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,920
brightness, etc. 

316
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,880
I would just 

317
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,080
skip that here. And then there are 

318
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,080
other menu items, such as 

319
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,580
Status. Here you can see the current 

320
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,620
battery status. The firmware version, 
which 

321
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,900
is perhaps interesting if there 

322
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,360
is a new one, if you perhaps 

323
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,420

324
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,160
get an instruction from the school . 
Memory capacity, which is 

325
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,200
of course all grayed out here 

326
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,740
due to this emulation on the 

327
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,120
computer. Okay, I think that's it 

328
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,240
so far. Right, here we can see 

329
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,080
the individual 

330
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,120
menu items in the settings menu again . 
And 

331
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,300
there are a few more tricks here 

332
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,280
that I 

333
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,540
would like to talk about briefly . In the 

334
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,140
document settings, you can 

335
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,560
navigate very easily by 

336
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
using the Tab key. I 

337
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,180
personally always do it with the 

338
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,560
directional pad, but with Tab you can 

339
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,640
always get to the 

340
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,820
next submenu very quickly , I'll 

341
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,980
maybe show that again very briefly if I 

342
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,780
'm here now and now press Tab 

343
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,540
then I get directly to the 

344
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,500
next field, is perhaps 

345
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,960
practical for one or the other and the 

346
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,280
rest is, I think, kind of deep, 

347
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,760
opening selection and memorized 

348
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,140
sub-item, I guess here 

349
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,240
the Enter key I think that's 

350
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,220
reasonably clear Good, here we see 

351
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,380
again the menu that we just 

352
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,020
saw. I think that's 

353
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,980
clear. And then I would say, 

354
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,660
let's take a look at how you 

355
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,480
can work with it in general. 

356
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,740
I could either 

357
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,740
open the scratchpad directly. That's this 

358
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,680
menu. But let's 

359
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,340
get out of here. We now want to 

360
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,860
work on a problem at school and 

361
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,180
may want to 

362
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,020
continue working on it tomorrow . 

363
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,600
so I' 

364
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,580
m just going to create a document here 

365
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,420
and I'm now here in the 

366
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,040
document. And such a document consists 

367
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,920
of several elements, i.e. 

368
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,180
a document can consist of a graph 

369
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,060
, a table or 

370
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,280
a calculation, that's this 

371
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,640
important function and that's why it says 

372
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,980
press menu again, 

373
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,480
I' ve just pressed it away and here 

374
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,620
I can now 

375
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,760
add these individual widgets or gadgets. 
and 

376
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,040
the most important thing we need 

377
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,060
, intuitively of course, is the 

378
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,020
calculator. In other words, this 

379
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,720
calculator 

380
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,340
is a kind of white paper where I 

381
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,860
can perform lots of calculations and 

382
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,120
these will then 

383
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,180
remain saved. For example, I can 

384
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,540
now calculate 5 at 6 here and 

385
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,900
then have the result directly here. Well, 

386
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,800
I find that a bit 

387
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,420
boring, so I would like to 

388
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,520
show you how you 

389
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,340
can use it effectively. And 

390
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,920
the convention of 

391
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,980
introducing variables is always 
recommended. Because with the help 

392
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,560
of variables, I can then 

393
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,060
create more complicated expressions 

394
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,740
and 

395
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,340
then simply change the values of the 
individual variables later and can 

396
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,220
then 

397
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,740
see very quickly, very nicely , how values 
then change. 

398
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
And here you can see how to 

399
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,980
introduce a variable and the 

400
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,560
key element is simply 

401
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,880
this colon equals operation 

402
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,080
or this operator. Because with 

403
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,620
colon equals, just like in 

404
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,320
programming languages, I can 

405
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,260
assign values and if I now 

406
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,700
enter Test, for example, I'll 

407
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,420
just use the computer 

408
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,940
 keyboard, now a little 

409
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,500
faster, colon equals and 

410
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,640
now, when I click on 

411
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,780
Enter, I have now 

412
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,360
saved this variable in the test. This 
means 

413
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,340
that if I now calculate Test 5 and 

414
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,280
as soon as I 

415
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,500
use Test again, I can see that 

416
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,320
the fetch is printed. 

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,000
This shows the system that you are now 
using 

418
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,440
a variable. If I now 

419
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,320
calculate Test plus 5 and press Enter 

420
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,160
, I get exactly the 

421
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,340
value. 5 plus 5, i.e. 10, 

422
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,150
is the simplest way 

423
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,950
. Here we also see 

424
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,510
another hint. 

425
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,310

426
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,270
I'll define the variables using Control. 

427
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,960
Yes, this is the 

428
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,940
symbol again . That is, here we see 

429
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,900
the assignment symbol at the top. This 
means 

430
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,780
that if I now 

431
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,400
want to assign A, B and now I want to 
assign more, then 

432
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,080
I just press Control. With Control, 

433
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,160
I can 

434
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,760

435
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,420
call up this second meaning of the 
individual keys and you can see 

436
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,360
this symbol directly here. Yes. This 

437
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,600
assignment symbol. Yes, this is supposed 
to 

438
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,040
be this explanation. Okay. 

439
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,080
Let's delete it again. Good. And 

440
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,960
now, of course, you can do a lot of 

441
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,720
nice things with it and yes, I 

442
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,200
can now 

443
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,900
calculate with normal numbers , 
definitions of other 

444
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,020
warming by existing 

445
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,680
variants. yes possible. In other words, I 

446
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,220
can say that a new test is simply 

447
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,740
a test squared. That is 

448
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,860
really very intuitive. Or test 

449
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,840
equals test three times. This is a 

450
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,760
special form of reuse 

451
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,100
, namely 

452
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,300
recursion. This means that I can 

453
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,400
simply 

454
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,180
triple the value. This is 

455
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,720
possible without any problems. And then 
there is a nice 

456
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,560
function, namely this wait button 

457
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,540
here. 

458
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,980
I can use this wait button to display all 
local variables 

459
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,280
. If I now 

460
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,840
press Wait here , I can see 

461
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,200
all the variables directly in the form of 
a drop-down 

462
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,460
 list. You can now also select them here 

463
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,660
, for example, if you 

464
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,140
have longer, more complicated 

465
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,460
variables or expressions. 

466
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Well, that's a few 

467
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,800
basic building blocks 

468
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,500
, but a graphic 

469
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,720
 calculator like this  can of course 

470
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,840
do much more. One of 

471
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,020
the key elements of graphing calculators 

472
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,420
are the graphical calculations. 

473
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,600
Graphical calculations mean 

474
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,740
iterative calculations using a 

475
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,660
suitable method. And an 

476
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,820
example method would be 

477
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,860
the Newton method for 

478
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,960
calculating zeros. 

479
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,120
I think this is also used here. And in 

480
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,260
this context, 

481
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,980
of course, it makes sense to 

482
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,700
define 

483
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,580

484
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,300
functions , especially in the field of 
analysis. And that's why it makes 

485
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,320
sense to 

486
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
define functions here too. And the system 

487
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
also recognizes when you 

488
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,360
define a function. And you can simply 

489
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,940
type it in intuitively in the same way as 
you 

490
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,840
would at school 

491
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,620
, for example with f of x. And if 

492
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,120
I now try an f on the 

493
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,580
keyboard, 

494
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,280
h, b, c, d, e, f, and if I now 

495
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,580
use the brackets and 

496
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,480

497
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,640
type in an X here, for example , you can 

498
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,500
also see the X, Y and Z keys below , they 
are 

499
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,160
also marked differently because 

500
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
you need them more often and 

501
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,960
if I now 

502
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,740
press this assignment symbol, the control, 

503
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,120
the, R of X equals, yes, let 

504
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,320
's somehow make X a square, minus 2 

505
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,120
as an example. Press Enter. Then 

506
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,540
the message ready appears immediately. 

507
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,520
This means that the calculator has 

508
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,120
also recognized at that moment that you 

509
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,380
have now defined a function. 

510
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,880
And the nice thing is that 

511
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,940
I can now 

512
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,920

513
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,520
carry out all further calculations using 
this function name. And there are now 

514
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,460
two functions that the calculator 

515
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,240
has to offer. 

516
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,580
One is Polyroutes and the other is 
Handsaw. 

517
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,100
Yes, N12 is a bit 

518
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,980
more powerful, you can also 

519
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,420
solve non-linear equations with it , but 

520
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,920
let's take a look at Polyroutes first 

521
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,480
. One advantage of polyroutes is that 

522
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,500
you can use them to 

523
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,640

524
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,140
calculate all possible solutions very 
quickly , but as the name suggests, they 

525
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,540
only apply to completely rational 

526
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,740
functions. In other words, here we see 

527
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,280
the call of the function, Polyroutes, 

528
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,260
f of x. and X, that is, this 

529
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,960
function directly assumes that 

530
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
, as the name suggests, 

531
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,620
roots, that you directly 

532
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,000
determine the zero in a function. 

533
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,740
In other words, it 

534
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
directly replaces this expression, which 
you enter here on the left, with 

535
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,260
zero. And if I now 

536
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,200
do the whole thing here , you can now 

537
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,260
type in the function manually or you 

538
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,860
can also search for it in the catalog. 

539
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,280
I'll have to have another quick look. 

540
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,440
Personally, I always use the 

541
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,780
entry variant, but if you 

542
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,160
look in the bell, I'll have 

543
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,940
a quick look at where you can do that. 

544
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,100
For example, you could 

545
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,440
search for it 

546
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
here, you could search for polyroutes here 

547
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,080
, under P. 

548
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,260
I've also seen msrc 

549
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,780
somewhere. Yes, there we have 

550
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,220
polyroutes, for example, and here we can 
see 

551
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,800
the whole thing again. 

552
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,960
The whole thing. And I could 

553
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,520
also make this assistant active here. 

554
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,440
This means that a window opens 

555
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,460
where you 

556
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,480
can enter the function and the 

557
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,220
value again directly. But I'll 

558
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,200
just leave that for now. Similarly 

559
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,640
, you can also do the whole thing through 
the menu. 

560
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,560
Exactly. To do this, however, you press 
Menu 

561
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,240
and then Analysis or 

562
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,420
solve numerically here , solve system 
linear 

563
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,240
equations or 

564
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,540
find roots of a polynomial here and here 

565
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,520
I can call up real polynomial roots 

566
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,540
and if you click on it, then 

567
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,920
exactly this function appears. And you 

568
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,520
can see that as soon as you 

569
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,800
type in a function here , the 

570
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,020
whole thing is no longer italicized. 
Whenever 

571
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,420
it is in italics, the computer assumes 

572
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,480
that it is a 

573
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,660
variable. Only when I type in the 

574
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,140
correct function name here does 

575
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,260
it become straight again and then 

576
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,160
I know that it's an 

577
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,440
identifier for me. I can 

578
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,300
't 

579
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,680
use that as a variable here, for example. 
Yes, now I'll just 

580
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,500
enter the function. f of x, you 

581
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,720
can see that it's now also in bold 

582
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,140
. So he knows, aha, 

583
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,580
I know f of x, it's defined. And 

584
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,860
now I have to 

585
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,560
insert the conditions for polyroutes here 
, namely 

586
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,300
polyroutes equal to 0 and 

587
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,190
then the whole thing with X and now we 
have 

588
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,970
an argument error here 

589
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,750
, because I think they have 

590
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,070
changed this with the new version. Maybe 
it's 

591
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,510
more practical if I 

592
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,630

593
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,490

594
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,590

595
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,600
enter the yes, if I lose this if I lose 
that , actions let's see I 'll always just 
enter f now. That 

596
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,660
is not defined. 

597
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,040
Then I'll do that with our 

598
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,720
catalog. 

599
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,010
And 

600
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,240
make an assistant. 

601
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,770
Okay, somehow it doesn't do that. 

602
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,650
Anyway, you can, I think 

603
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,790
I'll just do f . 

604
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,850
Yes, that's how he did it. Okay, 

605
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,430
that means 

606
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,550
you don't need this f of x equal to 0 in 
this case. 

607
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,370
It does that automatically. And 

608
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,150
here I have my two 

609
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,450
solutions, just as we 

610
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,350
would expect with this 

611
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,430
quadratic function. Root 2 and 

612
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,350
minus root 2. 

613
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,890
Good, and you can 

614
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,870
do the same with nSolve . 

615
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,870
And nSolve, as you can see here, you 

616
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,350
have to 

617
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,530
enter an estimated value, or you can enter 
an estimated value. and 

618
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,550
that's already a sign that 

619
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,730
the Newton method is being used here 

620
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,730
and that's why it's a 

621
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,890
bit more powerful than Polygon. 

622
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,890
But well, I don't want to 

623
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,170
go into any more detail here. If you 

624
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,350
have any specific questions about this, 

625
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,430
please feel free to ask them 

626
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,970
now. Then 

627
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,770
we can 

628
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,570
take a closer look at it again. Right, 
then there is 

629
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,050
one more function, namely 

630
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,470
the graphs. Display and 

631
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,050
analyze function and 

632
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,930
add graph to document. 

633
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,570
I'll have a look at insert doc and now 

634
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,770
we'll look for a graph here. And 

635
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,610
here I can now, yes, here we can 

636
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,550
now see our graph menu and here 

637
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,910
I can now also 

638
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,390
define a function directly, f1 of x, or I 

639
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,990
can also say, f1 of x is now 

640
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,990
equal to f of x. and by 

641
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,010
pressing Enter, by pressing Enter, 

642
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,750
I can then also 

643
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,570
calculate this function directly. The 
important thing is that 

644
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,130
all the sheets in this document, i.e. 

645
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,630
all the pages that I have here, 

646
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,230
share a memory. 

647
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,510
This means that all the variables that I 

648
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,070
have defined here in 1.1 are also 

649
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,650
available here. And that is very 

650
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,130
important. For example, I could 

651
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,390
now also 

652
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,270
calculate f of x x times test here , yes, 
such a variable. 

653
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,180
And then we see that the whole thing is 

654
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,700
now stretched or 

655
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,040
compressed by five. Yes, that's another 

656
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,860
important hint. And here I can 

657
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,120
really 

658
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,180
do additional things. 

659
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,080
I can now, well, I can 

660
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,220
also display several functions here 

661
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,940
. In other words, I can also 

662
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,320
add parameters. You do that 

663
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,860
here with an 

664
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,800
argument bar. But well, there are 

665
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,980
more games in there now, so I wouldn 

666
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,720
't 

667
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,120
go into any more detail. You can also 

668
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,660
analyze functions , which means 

669
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,080
that you open this menu again, this 

670
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,360
menu sub-item, and can then 

671
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,200
, for example, I have to have a 

672
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,900
quick look at Graf, exactly, then 

673
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,700
you go to Analyze Graf and 

674
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,000
I have my typical 

675
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,680
graphical calculation properties here. 

676
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,100
This means that I can 

677
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,240
directly determine the zeros , the 
minimum, the 

678
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,820
maximum, i.e. relativa, minima, 

679
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,720
maxima. I can 

680
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,140
determine intersection points , I can 

681
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,380
plot the derivative function 

682
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,340
or the antiderivative function or even 

683
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,180
the limited range. Ranges, 

684
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,400
sorry, so all sorts of things, 

685
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,020
yes, I'll do that here with 

686
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,040
the zero, I have to 

687
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,600
select the function once and, importantly, 
also 

688
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,140
the lower bound, yes, that means 

689
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,640
the Newton method again here, yes, 

690
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,640
and then you can see the two 

691
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,980
zeros here , yes, I could 

692
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,200
also do that here now , 

693
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,980
I think it shouldn 

694
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,540
't work with Tab , it's not doing it right 
now , then I should also 

695
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,240
be able to set the zero standard. 

696
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,140
They have also 

697
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,720
changed this again in the version. But 
it's 

698
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,800
actually a retrieve, which means 

699
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
you can 

700
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,240

701
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,820
change it very easily on the device , even 
here. Okay, good. 

702
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,300
I would do that at this point 

703
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,120
, or I would 

704
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,020
finish with this , as you can see here, 

705
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,400
you can also 

706
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,460
have tangent equations determined directly 
here. 

707
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,020
You then go to the Type 

708
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,280
Geometry menu item here. You can also 

709
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,380
do that. Then under 8. and then here 

710
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,120
on points and straight lines. Then 

711
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,800
I could also 

712
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,860
determine a tangent here, for example. I 
now 

713
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,880
select this graph. And then the 

714
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
point. And if you 

715
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,760
take a closer look here , you can see 

716
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,980
that the tangent is also 

717
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,860
displayed directly. So it's very 

718
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,240
general. Now I can 

719
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,320
move the point here again. 

720
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,380
And if you 

721
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,440
have a zero point, for example, then it 
snaps 

722
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,640
directly into the zero point. 

723
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,280
This is also very practical for 

724
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,420
this task. So you can 

725
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,200
really work very well with it. 

726
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,890
Okay, good. Here's 

727
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,630
another example with the 

728
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,490
integral. I can now 

729
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,110
briefly show this again theoretically. 

730
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,210
Simply 

731
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,890
analyze to zero. to graph. Then the 
integral. Here 

732
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,930
we enter the lower 

733
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,150
bound again. And here I can 

734
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,850
also 

735
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,210
click directly with the pointer on the 
zero point, for example. 

736
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,890
It rattles in very nicely. That's 

737
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,870
a really great function. I can 

738
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,050
now also 

739
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,570
select the other zero. And then I get my 

740
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,250
integral here. 

741
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,320
This is displayed somewhere. I' 

742
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
m just wondering what the value 

743
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:31,980
is here. 

744
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,580
I might have to 

745
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,400
click on it again . 

746
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,270
For some reason it' 

747
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,910
s not showing me this. 

748
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,870
I probably need to press Tab again. Well, 
it 

749
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,870

750
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,550
doesn't show me this in this version, 

751
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,470
but it's clear on the device itself and 
it' 

752
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,490
s always shown there. I 

753
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,510
don't know whether it 

754
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,230
has done that here. Okay, well, that's 

755
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,730
kind of wrong here, but 

756
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,730
it should definitely 

757
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,310
work on the device. 

758
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,840
Well, yes, and then there are 

759
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,280
other points, like here, for example, 

760
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
intersection, we've just 

761
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,340
done that. Exactly, yes. 

762
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,160
Good, you can 

763
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,660
also 

764
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:24,920
work with other functions here, for 
example. 

765
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,480
Yes, well, these are the 

766
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,760
basic functions and that's where I want to 

767
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,900
... 

768
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,360
I'd like to finish my presentation at this 
point . Yes, and if you 

769
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,580
like, please feel free to ask me any 

770
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,260
questions. I'll try to answer them too 

771
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,620
. Yes, with pleasure. 

772
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,420
That's 

773
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,670
a very good question. I myself 

774
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,170
come from NRW. I'm 

775
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,830
particularly familiar with the situation 
there. 

776
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,390
I don't know exactly what it's like in 
Bavaria. I 

777
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,250
mean in Bavaria, so I 

778
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,290
don't want to say anything wrong here. 

779
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,990
You might have to 

780
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,810
look that up again in the curriculum. 

781
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,370
In any case, if it is allowed, then there 
is 

782
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,570
probably also an Abitur 

783
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,330
. In other words, there will also be 

784
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,490
specific tasks. In any case, I know that 

785
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,690

786
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,910
there is no GTR in Baden-Württemberg. I'm 
guessing 

787
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,910
, that's just a guess, 

788
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,990
I'm guessing that it's not 

789
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,990
allowed in Bavaria. But I can have a 

790
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,750
look, that shouldn't 

791
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,810
be a problem and I can give you 

792
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,250
some brief information. GTR Bavaria. 

793
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,590
Yes, 

794
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,750
there is such a list. 

795
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,030
It's also available from the 

796
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,810
calculator manufacturers. And they 

797
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,450
also tell you directly 

798
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:54,190
what can be used in which federal state. 

799
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:54,850
I'll have a look there. 

800
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,560
Okay, I've just seen on a 

801
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
website 

802
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,800
that Bavaria probably 

803
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,860
doesn't 

804
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,360
use GTRs , it looks like they use 

805
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,420
CRSs instead . A CRS, Computer Algebra 

806
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,900
System, is another extended 

807
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,420
version of the GTR. This means 

808
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:29,200
that the arithmetic expressions 

809
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,860
are not calculated numerically, but 

810
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,640
exactly. Yes, CRS. Computer's own 

811
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,740
 system. And I see that 

812
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,880
the Class-Pad 2 from Casio  is 

813
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,040

814
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,680
allowed in secondary school level 2 in 
Bavaria. I've 

815
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,640
just seen that here. It seems to be 

816
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,960
correct. Yes, exactly. 

817
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,260
Yes, in NRW, for example, 

818
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,200
the GTR is mandatory and 

819
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,420
I mean even this model, 

820
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,780
I'm not 

821
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,680
quite sure right now , but in any case, I 

822
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,800
don't think the model is 

823
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,020
mandatory, but the GTR in general 

824
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,180
is mandatory and there is 

825
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,360
definitely an 

826
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,280
Abitur exam where you, yes, or with 

827
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,800
which you can then, or where the GTR 

828
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,900
can be used when answering 

829
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,600
the questions. 

830
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,900
In any case , there is also a part in 

831
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,320
NRW that is free of aids , which means 
that the GTR may 

832
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,180
not be used there. These are 

833
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,700
also tasks that you 

834
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,480
can solve very easily in your head or are 

835
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,520
also 

836
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,540
tested on knowledge in the largest circle. 
And I suspect 

837
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,740
that it 

838
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,200
will be similar in Bavaria. 

839
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,690
Yes, with pleasure. Perhaps 

840
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,330
a quick question here. 

841
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,570
A little later at 8 

842
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,470
.30 p.m. there will also be 

843
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,570

844
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,690
a training course on the 

845
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,650
Casio graphics calculator especially for 
tutors 

846
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,110
. I will also be 

847
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,250
holding this in a moment. Have you also 
registered for this 

848
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,710
or are you also 

849
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,290
interested? Then I'll already 

850
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,790
know whether I' 

851
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,790
m expecting participants. That would be 

852
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,950
good information for me 

853
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,480
. However, the presentation 

854
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,440
will then refer to the Casio, which means 
that 

855
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,340
I will show you there , okay, good, then 

856
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,740
I know yes, if you 

857
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,980
have no further questions, then 

858
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,200
I would 

859
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,600
end the webinar at this point and yes, 
then thank you 

860
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,240
again for your attention and 

861
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,460
then I wish you 

862
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,400
a nice rest of the evening and 

863
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,600
maybe I'll see 

864
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,400
you again in the other webinars. Well, 

865
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,900
thank you very much and then I'll end 

866
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,400
the webinar now
