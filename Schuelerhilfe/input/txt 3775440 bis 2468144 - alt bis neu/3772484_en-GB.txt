00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,150
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,510
on calculating percentages and interest. 

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,150
In this webinar, we will first 

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,430

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,070
take a look at calculating percentages . 
We will solve it using 

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,450
example problems with the rule of three 

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,710
and also 

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,110
demonstrate the formulas for calculating 
percentages. 

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,410
We will then 

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,890
move on to the calculation of interest. 

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,250
Interest calculation is actually just a 

12
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,250
modified form of 

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,310
percentage calculation. We will 

14
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,310

15
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,190

16
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,090
look at annual interest, monthly interest, 
daily interest and finally compound 
interest. And we 

17
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,350
will also 

18
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,970

19
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,950
see the parallels between the percentage 
calculation and the interest calculation. 
We will 

20
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,290

21
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,390
deal with everything using a small 
example. You'll 

22
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,890
see that in a moment. Let's start with the 

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,310
basic concepts of percentages. 

24
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,390
There are 30 

25
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,030
pupils in a class. Of these, 6 come 

26
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,610
to school by bike. That corresponds to 

27
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,830
20%. We have three figures to start with. 

28
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,670
And these three values also exist 

29
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,670
in percentage calculation. These are 

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,610
the basic value, the 

31
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,930
percentage value and the percentage rate. 
The 

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,390
basic value has the letter G, the 

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,530
percentage value W and the percentage P%. 

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,520
The task now is to find these three 

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,640
pieces of information G, W and P% from 
this 

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,560
text. The basic value is 

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,600
always the whole, i.e. everything 
together. 

38
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,620
In our case, this means the number of 

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,880
pupils in the class. 

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,220
For us, this is 30, which means our G is 
30 

41
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,700
pupils. The percentage value is the 

42
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,300
share, the share of the whole, but 

43
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,420
not as a percentage, but as a number. 

44
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,420
This means that six of our 

45
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,160
pupils come by bike. And that is 

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,580
the proportion of the 30, i.e. 

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,940
our 6 is the percentage. The 

48
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,540
percentage is the ratio. It 

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,820
's always the one with the percentage 

50
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,120
. Maybe you can remember it like that 

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,260
and it will always 

52
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,600
help you. And that's 20% for us. 

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,460
Normally you are only given two 

54
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,660
of these three values. The 

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,820
third must always be determined. And 

56
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,120
that is... you can 

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,940
calculate the G, W and P percentages . 

58
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,480
On the one hand, as mentioned at the 
beginning, there are 

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,340
formulas for this and, on the other hand, 

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,840
this can also be solved using the rule of 
three. 

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
We will show you how to do this below, 

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,480
first using the rule of three and 

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
then demonstrating the formulas 

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,440
. Please note that we now have 

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,660
a different situation here. 

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,860
Out of 250 students, 44% 

67
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,820
choose dish A from the menu in their 

68
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,140
canteen. This means that we 

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,200
first have to consider what the 250 are 

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,340
and what the 44% are. 250 pupils 

71
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,580
is the total number, i.e. it 

72
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,580
is our G. And 44% is the 

73
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,220
percentage, i.e. it is 

74
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,860
our P%. What we are missing is the 

75
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,340
percentage value W. So how many pupils 

76
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,880
will ultimately make up the court. We 

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,940
know 44% of the pupils. The question 

78
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,820
now is, how many pupils are there 

79
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,320
now? and we can solve this with 

80
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,800
a rule of three. We know that 

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
 100% of the pupils correspond to 250. 

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
First we go down to 1%, 

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,340
i.e. we divide by 100. 

84
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,680
We do this on both sides, as is 

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,820
usual. This is a 

86
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,040
quasi-proportional allocation. In other 
words 

87
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,260
, we divide by 

88
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,340
100 on both sides . 1% is then 2.5 pupils 
and we 

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,900
know we have 44, so 

90
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,260
we multiply by 44 to get... 

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,980
44 percent. We now know 

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,560
that 110 pupils 

93
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,340
correspond to 44 percent , so 110 pupils 
choose 

94
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,480
dish A. 

95
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,040
Of course, you can 

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,740
also ask the question the other way 
around. 44 percent 

97
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,440
of all pupils eat dish A from 

98
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,240
the menu in their canteen. That 

99
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,920
is a total of 110 pupils. In this 

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,220
case, we have 

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,320
given our percentage value P percent, 44 
percent of all And 

102
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,860
now it says that this is a total of 

103
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,600
110. This means that 110 pupils 

104
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,860
correspond to 44%. That is not the 

105
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,020
total. Therefore, the 110 are 

106
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,180
worth our percent. We are looking for our 

107
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,140
basic value. Therefore, we 

108
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,620
now have to 

109
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,600
set up the rule of three differently. We 
know that 44% is 110. 

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,100
First, as is almost always the case with 
the rule 

111
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,540
of three , we go down to 1, i.e. 1% 

112
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,020
in this case . So we divide both 

113
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,800
by 44. Then we know that 1% is 2 

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,180
.5. Now we want to know how 

115
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,140
many pupils the school 

116
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,820
has in total. So we want to determine 
100%. 

117
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,320
So we go back to 100 

118
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,860
and multiply by 100 to get 

119
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,760
100%. We multiply 

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,240
by 

121
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,480
100 on both sides and then arrive at the 
result, 

122
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,600
100% is 250. Consequently, we know that 

123
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,420
the school has a total of 250 pupils. 

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,060
That would be the answer to this question. 

125
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,940
Last but not least, we can of course 

126
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,860
calculate our P-percent. One way of 

127
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,380
doing this could be to ask 

128
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,000
110 of the total 250 pupils 

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,420
to choose meal A in the canteen 

130
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,800
. You can see immediately that 110 of the 

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
total 250 pupils have chosen this meal . 
This means 

132
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,260
that we are given the percentage value and 

133
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,920
the basic value, but what is missing is 
the 

134
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,880
percentage share, our p-percentage. 

135
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,580
We now have to 

136
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,520
calculate this below. Of course, we know 
that the 

137
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,020
school has a total of 250 pupils. 

138
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,000
This means that 100 percent is 250, 

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,080
but we are now using 

140
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,840
the right-hand column as a guide , because 
we want to 

141
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,580
end up with 110 pupils. 

142
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,280
This means that we first calculate 

143
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,460
how many What percentage is 

144
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,720
a pupil? So we divide by 

145
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,880
250 and we know that one pupil is 

146
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,780
0.4 percent. Then 

147
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,280
we multiply by 110 to get 110 

148
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,480
pupils. And 110 is 44 

149
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,780
percent. So we know that 44 

150
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,320
percent of all pupils 

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,080
choose dish A. And that is 

152
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,880
the answer to the question. 

153
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,140
So you can see that if you know two 
figures, 

154
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,600
you can always calculate the third... 

155
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,440
and there are three ways 

156
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
you can go. So either W is 

157
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,400
unknown or G is unknown or P 

158
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,860
% is unknown. These are the three 

159
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,080
possibilities that you have and you can 

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,540

161
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,840
solve this on the one hand using the rule 
of three , as we 

162
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,220
have demonstrated here , and the other 
possibility is 

163
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,360
to solve it using the formulas. 

164
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,220

165
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,140
There is of course a formula for each of 
these three individual cases. Once 

166
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,900
for the basic value, if the 

167
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,340
percentage value W is sought, the 

168
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,920
formula. Once when the basic value G 

169
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,900
is searched for and the formula for the 

170
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,800
percentage value. We have 

171
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,560
always 

172
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,500
entered the data from the exercises at the 
back here. This 

173
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,080
means that if we are 

174
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,240
looking for the percentage value W , it is 
simply the basic value 

175
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,720
multiplied by our p% by 100. 

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,440
In the first exercise, we had 

177
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,340
the situation where we 

178
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,500
had 250 pupils and 44% chose 

179
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,280
court A. If we now 

180
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,200
wanted to calculate how many these are, 
then 

181
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,260
we would calculate 250 times 44 by 

182
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,360
100. That is 110, exactly the result 

183
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,460
that we 

184
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,280
calculated earlier using the table. If we 
are 

185
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,820
looking for the basic value G, G is equal 
to W 

186
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,060
times 100 by P%. If we 

187
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,940
want to calculate the basic value, it is 

188
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,320
equal to our percentage value times 100 

189
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,800
divided by our percentage. So 

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
for us right now, we had 110 

191
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,540
students next to Court A, which was 

192
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,320
44%. That means our 110 was our 

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,860
percentage value and 44 was our 
percentage. 

194
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,120
And so we get 110 times 100 

195
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,540
divided by 44 and that's 250 again. That 

196
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,940
means we would then know the 

197
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,480
students... a total of 250 students. 

198
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,520
Last but not least, we 

199
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,160
calculated the percentage p%. This 

200
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,480
is simply calculated by 100 times the 

201
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,460
percentage value divided by the basic 
value. 

202
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,580
So the last question we had was 

203
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,140
110 out of 52 students next to court A. 

204
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,480
What percentage is that? 110 was 

205
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,540
our percentage value, our 

206
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,060
basic value was 250 and so we 

207
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,920
arrive at 100 times 110 divided by 250 and 
that 

208
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
is 44 percent. Here you can see 

209
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,040
again that you always have to 

210
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,500
use two values to 

211
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,640
calculate the third. And for each case 
there is 

212
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,640
a suitably rearranged form. 

213
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,960
Of course, you can just memorize one 

214
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,160
and then always rearrange the formula 

215
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,380
accordingly. 

216
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,840
Of course, this is a bit more 

217
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,460
arithmetic work, but it is also 

218
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,900
possible. This brings us to 

219
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,980
counting. Interest calculation 

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,020
, or rather the basic concepts 

221
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,660
of interest calculation. Interest 
calculation 

222
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,060
is basically nothing more 

223
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,540
than the application of percentage 
calculation 

224
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,420
with money. For example, if you deposit 
money 

225
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,180
in a savings account, i.e. 

226
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,980
I invest money, then I receive 

227
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,220
money from the bank for 

228
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,420
storing the money with them. The 

229
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,240
additional money I get from them is 

230
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,400
called interest. And the amount of this 

231
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,340
interest, i.e. how much money I 

232
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,460
ultimately get for it, depends 

233
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,020
on how long I 

234
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,720
leave the money there. That is very 
important. This 

235
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,140
interest is always 

236
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,400
calculated as a percentage , which means 
that I get 

237
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,080
a certain percentage per year 

238
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
for the money I 

239
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,460
store with them. Of course, this means 
that if I 

240
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,220
leave my money with them for longer, 

241
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,300
I get more because 

242
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,560
I 

243
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,700
do it over several years. And of course 
there is also the 

244
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,520
counter-example. So I can not 

245
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,160
only invest money at the bank, I 

246
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,020
can also borrow money. And that 

247
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,340
's exactly the opposite 

248
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,660
example. If I borrow money from the 

249
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,700
bank, I have to pay money for it 

250
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,440
because I'm using a 

251
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,520
service , so to speak. 

252
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,860
So that means I don't get any 

253
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,780
interest, but I have to 

254
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,140
pay interest. Yes, you have to be careful. 

255
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,900
If I borrow money, i.e. 

256
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,460
take out a loan, what I 

257
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,860
have to pay is also called interest. 
Interest 

258
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,400
can mean that I 

259
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,040
have to pay something or that I receive 
something. 

260
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,260
You always have to 

261
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,820
pay attention to the context. That's 

262
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,160
the most important thing about 

263
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,860
calculating interest. 

264
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,940
Let's take a look at the three formulas 
and the three 

265
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,080
things involved. 

266
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,760
There is the capital K, the 

267
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,780
interest Z and the interest rate P%. 

268
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,580
It's basically the same 

269
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,380
formulas, we just have different 

270
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,480
names. The basic value, as it 

271
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,780
used to be called, is now the 

272
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,240
capital. That's what I have. 

273
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,020
The interest, i.e. the percentage value, 

274
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,820
is Z here. So what was previously the 

275
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,320
percentage value is now the 

276
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
interest . And what was previously the 

277
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
percentage is now the 

278
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,120
interest rate. 

279
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,040
You can also see the three formulas here. 

280
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,740
If I want to calculate the interest Z 

281
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,000
, I have my 

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,280
capital multiplied by p% by 100, i.e. the 

283
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
same formula as we 

284
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,320
have for the percentage value. 

285
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,680
If I want to calculate my capital, the K 

286
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,180
is equal to Z and therefore my interest 

287
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,700
times 100 by p%, i.e. by my 

288
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,960
interest rate. This is more or less the 
same 

289
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,640
as calculating the percentage value. 

290
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,180
And p% is equal to 100 times z divided by 
k, i 

291
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,980
.e. my interest divided by my 

292
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,060
capital. As I said, these are the 

293
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,040
same formulas, just with different 

294
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,640
names. And we will take a look at these 

295
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,240
below. 

296
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,920
At the beginning of the year, Johannes 

297
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,740
invested 5000 euros with a bank 

298
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,060
. The interest rate is 3.5 

299
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,460
percent. How much interest will he receive 

300
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,020
at the end of the year? Interest 

301
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,520
is always paid out 

302
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,460
or stated per year and Johannes has 

303
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,020
invested 5,000 euros at 3.5 percent 

304
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,480
interest. And the question now is how 

305
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,340
much interest he will 

306
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,500
receive at the end of the year. So we are 
looking for interest. 

307
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,580
Our capital and our interest rate are 

308
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,860
given to us. This means that our capital 

309
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,060
K is 5,000 and our interest rate p 

310
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,940
percent is 3.5 and we can 

311
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,220
now simply insert this into the 
appropriate formula 

312
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,400
for the interest, which was z 

313
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,700
is equal to k times p percent by 100 

314
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,940
, so our capital times our 

315
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,860
percentage rate by 100 means 

316
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,180
5000 times 3.5 by 100 and that is 

317
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,200
175 euros, which means that johannes 

318
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,540
will receive 175 euros at the end of the 
year 

319
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,020
or has 5175 euros in his 

320
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,080
bank account after this time. 

321
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,120
Another example. Maya 

322
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,360

323
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,400
invested 2000 euros at a bank at the 
beginning of the year. After one year, she 
has 

324
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,160
a total of 2200 euros in her account. 

325
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,080
What was the original 

326
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
interest rate? Here you can see what I 

327
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,640
just did quickly 

328
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,940
. I 

329
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,420
also said earlier with Johannes that he 
had 

330
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,040
5175 euros in his account after one year , 
i.e. the 

331
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,800
money he had in his account earlier 

332
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
, plus his interest. 

333
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,200
It's the same with Maya. After one year, 
she has 

334
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,640
2,200 euros in her account. 

335
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,780
She had invested 2,000 euros. That 

336
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,900
means her interest is 200 euros. 

337
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,590
You have to be careful. You haven 

338
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,090
't indicated the interest here, 

339
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,910
but simply the account balance 

340
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,430
after one year. And the account balance 

341
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,470
after one year minus the 

342
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,370
original account balance is then 

343
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,790
just... The interest, that's 

344
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,650
200 euros for Maya. And we want to 

345
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,350
calculate Maya's interest rate. We 

346
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,510
know her interest and we know her 

347
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,510
capital. So interest was 200 euros, 

348
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,730
capital was 2000 euros. And 

349
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,630
now we can use the formula for the 

350
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,550
interest rate P%. This is calculated 

351
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,190
as 100 times the interest divided by the 

352
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,830
capital. In our case, this is 100 times 
200 

353
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,190
times 2000 and that is 10%. Consequently, 

354
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,970
Maya receives 10% interest per year. 

355
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,280
Of course, you don't 

356
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,240
always have to invest your money for a 
year. You can 

357
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,800
also have it paid out before then. 

358
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,820
The interest is therefore 

359
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,080
calculated on a pro rata basis. Here we 
see 

360
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,560
the formula for the monthly interest. In 
other words, 

361
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,440
the formula that you can use if you 

362
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,860

363
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,800
withdraw your money after three months , 
for example. 

364
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
On January 1, you have 1,000 euros 

365
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,540
in your account. The interest rate is 

366
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,940
2%. After three months, you will receive 5 

367
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,900
euros in interest. This is the 

368
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,700
formula for the interest. Z is equal to K 

369
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,480
times P percent by 100 times M by 

370
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,240
12. This means that if I 

371
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,360
don't 

372
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,580
take the money out of the account after a 
year , but before, the interest 

373
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,840
is calculated proportionally. 

374
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,280
As you know, the year has twelve months. 

375
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,880
This means that it is 

376
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,940
calculated proportionally. In this case, 
it is 

377
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,800
taken from the account after three months. 

378
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,180
That means our M is 3, we 

379
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,360
get 2% interest, which means our P 

380
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,180
% is 2 and we have 

381
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,840
invested a capital K of 1000 euros. That 
is our 

382
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,140
K 1000 euros. With this information, 

383
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,120
we could now 

384
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,760
calculate the interest. That would be 5 
euros. 

385
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,910
Now we come to a question. Arne 

386
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,390

387
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,550
invests a starting capital of 6,000 euros 
at a bank on January 1. The 

388
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,170
interest rate is 4% per year. So 

389
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,950
the P.A. means per year. Or stands 

390
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,470
for per year. A stands for the year. 

391
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,150
The first interest payment is made in the 

392
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,110
first quarter. How high is 

393
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,840
his account at that time? The first 

394
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,280
quarter, you can 

395
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,120
divide the year into four quarters, i.e. a 

396
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,980
quarter of the year. A quarter is 

397
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,300
therefore three months long. This means 
that 

398
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,260
after three months, Arne 

399
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,960
receives his interest on his account, i.e. 
his 

400
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,440
share. In other words, he has invested a 
capital 

401
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,120
of 6,000 euros and receives 

402
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,320
4% interest on it. And the money was 

403
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,100
automatically 

404
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,440
invested for three months, so to speak, 
and then the 

405
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,740
interest for the three months is 

406
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,300
transferred to your account. So that means 
our 

407
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,240
capital is 6,000 euros, our 

408
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,960
percentage rate P% is 4% and our 

409
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,780
term M is 3. As I said, a 

410
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,640
quarter has three months, so 

411
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,980
we arrive at 6,000 times 4% divided by 100 
times 3 

412
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,640
twelfths. He receives 60 euros in 
interest. 

413
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,360
But the question is, what is his 

414
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,320
account balance? In other words, he gets 

415
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,140
60 euros, but he already had 6,000, which 

416
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,020
means we have to add the 60 euros to the 

417
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,860
6,000 and arrive at 6 

418
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,280
,060 euros. And that's 

419
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,560
Arne's  new account balance. 

420
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,920
Of course, there is also daily interest. 

421
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,600
This means that you can 

422
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,900
invest the money for a shorter period of 
time or you could 

423
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,120
theoretically withdraw it every day. 

424
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,900
That's why you also need 

425
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,620
daily interest. An example of this. On 

426
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,560
January 1, you have 1000 euros in 

427
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,380
your account. The interest rate is 2%. 

428
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,080
After 45 days you receive 2.50 euros 

429
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,720
interest. 

430
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,840
T, the time, is important here. T 

431
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
here is in days. This can also be seen 
from 

432
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,800
the 360. Here you can see that the year 

433
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,120
is assumed to have 360 days. And 

434
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,680
that's why it's also 

435
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,060
shown here on a pro rata basis. The 1000 
euros 

436
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,780
is again our capital. Our 

437
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,820
interest rate P% is 2% and our 

438
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,780
term is 45. We can 

439
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,480
then use this to 

440
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,640
calculate the interest that would be paid 
out. So 1000 times 2 

441
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,120
by 100 times 45 by 360, which 

442
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,230
in this case is probably 2.50 euros. And 

443
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,390
Arne invests something in 

444
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,710
the bank again. He invests a 

445
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,270
starting capital of 2500 euros at 

446
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,010
the bank. The interest rate is 

447
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,590
10%. The first interest payment is made 

448
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,370
after 100 days. How high is this 

449
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,690
interest at that time? This means 

450
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,690
that Arne invests money in the bank again 

451
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,670
and in this case he receives the 

452
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,710
first interest payment after 100 days 

453
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,730
. The question now is, how 

454
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,870
much interest will he receive 

455
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,950
? In this case, 2500 euros is again 

456
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,490
his capital, which he invests, our K. 

457
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,890
The interest rate is 10%, which is 

458
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,610
our P%, and the time T after which it 

459
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,690
is paid out is 100. So 

460
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,730
we arrive at 2500 euros times 10% 

461
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,530
by 100 times 100 by 360. This 

462
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,990
means that in this case we are only 

463
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,110
asking about the amount of interest, 

464
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,130
not about his account balance. 

465
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,750
It is therefore sufficient to calculate 
the interest 

466
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,870
, which in this case is 69.44 

467
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,210
euros. And that is the money that 

468
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,910
the value owner has in his account 

469
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,470
after 100 days. 

470
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,680
Now we come to compound interest. 

471
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
I said earlier that the 

472
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,420
interest always relates to the year 

473
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,280
and is usually 

474
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,860
paid out at the end of the year 

475
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,180
, or is in the account. 

476
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,260
This means that I have 

477
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,420
a different capital after each year. And 
if I 

478
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,940
now want to know how much money 

479
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,580

480
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,900
I have in my account after 5 years, for 
example , it becomes very 

481
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,720
laborious with the calculations I made 
earlier. 

482
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,960
That's why there's this formula for 

483
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,500
compound interest, because I get 

484
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,140

485
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,080
interest again on the interest from the 
previous year. So it's 

486
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,140
only about annual interest. 

487
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,200
Monthly interest does not 

488
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,100
earn interest again. And 

489
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,220
this is the formula for 

490
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,620
compound interest. We have KT, i.e. the 

491
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,420
capital after T years. This is equal to 

492
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,600
our initial capital, K0, i.e. the 

493
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,300
money we actually invest, times, 

494
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,860
brackets open, 1 plus P-percent divided by 

495
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,420
100. This P-percent is 

496
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,700
again our interest rate and to the power 
of T, these 

497
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,320
are the years, how long I 

498
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,180
invest the money. In other words, for 
example, 

499
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,360
on January 1st there is 1000 euros 

500
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,280
in the account, the interest rate is 

501
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,100
2%, after 3 years the interest rate 

502
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,340
on the account balance is 1061.21 euros. 
cents. 

503
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,260
This means that you have 

504
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,660
already earned compound interest on the 
1,000 euros. 

505
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,860
You have 

506
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,700
invested over the three years. This means 
that the money 

507
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,340
you received for the first year, 

508
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,360
the interest, has already 

509
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,080
earned interest twice again. This is 
called 

510
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,640
compound interest. And it's exponential. 

511
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,200
We'll 

512
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
see that in a moment. So the more money 
you 

513
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,460
have in the bank, which is always 

514
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,860
a percentage, the more money 

515
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,820
you get as interest. So it's 

516
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,880
not linear. The interest 

517
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,300
increases from year to year because I also 

518
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,660
have more and more money in the bank. 

519
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,900
Provided you don't withdraw any money. 

520
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,460
Well, let's get to the question. At the 
beginning, 

521
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,260
2000 euros are 

522
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,460
invested at a bank. The percentage rate is 
10%. 

523
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,260
So after two years, the 

524
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,880
interest is 420 euros. Arne Heinz 

525
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,360
now claims that if I double the years, 

526
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,160
the interest doubles. Is he 

527
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,400
right? We know that 

528
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,960
we have received 420 euros in interest for 
two years. And 

529
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,280
now we simply check this and 

530
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,980
calculate how much money he 

531
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,180
has after four years. The 2000 

532
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,180
is of course our capital. So 

533
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,100
we use it for our K0, the 10% 

534
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,260
is our P% and we now 

535
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,180
simply calculate K4, which means the 

536
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,520
capital after 4 years, as I said, 

537
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,820
so our T is also a 4, i.e. 

538
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,140
the index that is below here is 

539
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,180
always above here in the exponent 

540
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,660
, which means we come to 2000 times 

541
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,060
brackets on 1 plus 10% by 100 

542
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,600
brackets to the power of 4 then we know 

543
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,080
after 4 years there are 2,928.20 euros in 

544
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,860
the account. It is important to note that 
with 

545
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,420
compound interest you always get the 

546
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,820
money that is there at the end. That 

547
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,940
really is the total. 

548
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,760
It's not just the interest, it's the 

549
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,320
capital that's in the account. 

550
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,260
This means that 928.20 euros were 

551
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,820
paid out in interest, because 

552
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,900
2,000 euros were invested at the 
beginning. 

553
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,300
Of course, we have to 

554
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,120
deduct this from the value here. 

555
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,680
And if Arne were right, 

556
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,800
then we would only have to 

557
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,280
divide the 928 by 2. And then we would 
have to 

558
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,700
get the same interest as 

559
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
for the 2 years. Because 4 divided by 

560
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,560
2 is also 2 years. So 

561
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,980
let's just do that. And we 

562
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,900
come up with 464.10 euros. That's 

563
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,520
considerably more than he 

564
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,220
got for 2 years. And Arne 

565
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,880
Heinz is wrong about that. As I said, 
that's 

566
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,740
because it's exponential 

567
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,120
growth and the more money you 

568
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,240
have in your account, the more money you 

569
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,260
invest, the more interest you get 

570
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,960
. Well, that brings us to 

571
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
the end of the webinar. Thank you 

572
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,000
very much for your 

573
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,700
attention.
