00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,350
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,870
root equation webinar . In 

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,430
this webinar , we will be looking at root 
equations 

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,430
. First, let's take a look 

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,270
at what a 

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,390
root function actually is , because root 
functions are 

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,050
usually the most common 

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,690
root equation. And then we will 

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,070
also solve root equations 

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,590
, or rather we will 

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,550
demonstrate a solution method for them. 

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,430
Well, let's start with the 

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,470
root functions. 

14
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,370
For root functions, it is 

15
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,870
fundamentally very important to 

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,030

17
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,590
know the domain of definition in the range 
of values. The 

18
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,910
domain of definition for a 

19
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,830
general root function, i.e. the 

20
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,630
inverse function of x², is that you 

21
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,610

22
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,110
can use all positive real numbers and the 
root function 

23
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,490
then also has the range of values for 

24
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,590
all positive real numbers. If 

25
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,430
you have such a root function 

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,570
or 

27
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,750
want to calculate something with it , it 
is always very 

28
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,810
important to determine the 

29
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,810
domain first. 

30
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,090
We will see this in a moment. This 

31
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,490
is always different. As 

32
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,710
I said , this is just for the 

33
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,270
general root function. So f of 

34
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,750
x is equal to the square root of x. 

35
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,910
This starts at the origin. That goes 

36
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,710
together with it. The square root of 0 

37
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,690
can still be determined. That is the 

38
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,650
limiting case. And that is then simply 

39
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,070
0. And the square root of infinity is 

40
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,870
then also infinite, i.e. the 

41
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,730
function starts at a 

42
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,830
coordinate origin and tends to 

43
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,770
infinity. As I said, it returns 

44
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,210
all positive numbers. The 

45
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,790
value table for the general 

46
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,090
root function would now 

47
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,910
only look like this: if we insert an x 

48
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,310
with 0, the 

49
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,150
function value 0 would also come out, with 
1 

50
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,930
the function value 1 would also come out. 

51
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,550
With a 4, the function value 2 would come 
out 

52
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,490
and so on. This means that the 

53
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,730
root function always increases 

54
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,750
more slowly. And that brings us 

55
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,450
to the root equation. 

56
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,970
Root equations are 

57
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,950
characterized by the fact that our 
variable 

58
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,210
is under the root. This is very 

59
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,050
important. Our variable must be under 

60
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,750
the root. If our 

61
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,310
variable 

62
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,190
is not under the root , we do not have a 

63
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,390
root equation. 

64
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,240
Basic calculation rules 

65
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,260

66
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,900
do not change for completely rational 
functions. They are also completely normal 

67
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,120
equations, as we 

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,200
know them from completely rational 
functions. 

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,180
There are just one or two things to 

70
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,360
bear in mind here. And then we start 

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,000
directly with solving such a 

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,920
root equation. As you can see, 

73
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,340
there are basically four steps 

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,880
to follow. First of all, 

75
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,980
as already mentioned, we need to know the 

76
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,400
definition set of the root. 

77
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
We should determine this first. 

78
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,660
Then we try to 

79
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,860
isolate the root in the second step in 
order to 

80
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,880

81
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,620
square the equation in the third step , 
i.e. 

82
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,000
square the square root and thus 

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,240
eliminate the root. So in the 

84
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,780
third step, we try to 

85
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,740
eliminate our root and 

86
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,480
then solve the whole thing in order to 
finally 

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,380
check at 4 whether our 

88
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,580
result lies in the domain of definition 

89
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,380
and do the test again. But 

90
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,140
let's start with point 1, the 

91
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,980
domain. We 

92
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,460
absolutely have to know the domain of the 
root 

93
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,140
because otherwise we don't know 

94
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,980
what numbers we can use 

95
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,380
and whether the solution that we 

96
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,280
have calculated at the end is even... 

97
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,640
lies in our definition set. It 

98
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,560
happens very often with 

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,880
root equations that you get a 

100
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,140
result that 

101
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,060
lies outside the domain. Simply 

102
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,880
because of this squaring. It is therefore 

103
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,580
essential to determine the 

104
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,840
domain first. We 

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,700
demonstrate this root equation or the 

106
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,400
solving of this root equation using 

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
the example of 2 times bracket to 

108
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,840
root of x plus 4 minus 2 bracket 

109
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,420
to equal 14. and the 

110
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,060
definition set of a root 

111
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,620
is always calculated by the 

112
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,520
conditions that you have. In 

113
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,660
the case of the square root , this is 
simply that 

114
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,140

115
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,980
there must always be a value greater than 
or equal to 0 under the root , because 

116
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,300

117
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,420
we cannot 

118
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,920
take roots from negative numbers with our 
number range. Therefore, x plus 4 

119
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
is greater than or equal to 0. That would 
be the 

120
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,720
equation for it. and 

121
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,020
if we solve this inequality , we will then 

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
find that x 

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,300
is greater than or equal to minus 4. This 
means that for all x that 

124
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,440
is greater than or equal to minus 4, 

125
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,720
our root equation is defined, 

126
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,660
or our 

127
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,480
root function, if you like. 

128
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
This 

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,840
completes step 1. We have our 

130
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,380
domain of definition, our 

131
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,580
set of definitions, and can therefore 

132
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,480
begin step 2. 

133
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,500
Isolating the root means that we 

134
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,480

135
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,160
have the root of x plus 4 standing alone 
at the end. This means that we 

136
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,440
start now and first 

137
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,560
remove the 2 in front of the bracket. We 
have 

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,640
the bracket twice, so 

139
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,820
we divide everything by 2 so that the 2 in 
front of it 

140
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,060
disappears. This means that we also have 
to 

141
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,500
divide the 14 by 2. That's why there's 

142
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,180
only a 7 here, so we get 

143
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,960
the root of x plus 4 minus 2 

144
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,340
equals 7. The minus 2 must then 

145
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,260
necessarily disappear. I would 

146
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,160
always advise, even if it is a lot of work 

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
and sometimes 

148
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,380
seems a bit unnecessary, to 

149
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,360
rearrange and 

150
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,700
simplify until the root really does 

151
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,060
stand alone. Otherwise 

152
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,920
you almost always need binomial formulas. 

153
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,520
And that's not so nice. You make 

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,540
things more complicated than they 

155
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,860
actually are. That's why you should always 

156
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,080
add the 2. We do this 

157
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,280
with a plus 2, so we can 

158
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,400
get rid of the minus 2. Then we have the 

159
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,660
root of x plus 4 is equal to 7 plus 

160
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,180
2, i.e. 9. And now you can see that 

161
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,300
the root stands alone and 

162
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,680
there is only one 9 on the right-hand 
side. 

163
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,280
This means that if there 

164
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,860

165
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,720
is no addition or subtraction here , then 
we don't need any 

166
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,700
binomial formulas, which is very nice 

167
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,220
for the task, so 

168
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,200
step 2 is complete, our root 

169
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
stands alone and we can 

170
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,840
start with step 3, i.e. we 

171
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,640
square 

172
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,660
it again here is the hint if 

173
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,420
there were a sum on the right or 

174
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,620
maybe even on the left, then 

175
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,260
we would inevitably need the binomial 

176
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,560
formula formulas when squaring because 

177
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,100
we are now squaring the whole thing and 

178
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,040
then we have the square of the 

179
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,660
root of x plus 4 is equal to the 9 

180
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,100
squared, i.e. the whole side 

181
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,760
always. Square and root 

182
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,080
cancel each other out, which is why we 
square them 

183
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,940
. That's why x 

184
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,240
plus 4 is now on the left and 9 

185
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,620
squared on the right , i.e. 81. And if we 

186
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,040
had had 9 

187
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,120
plus x on the right , we 

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
would have had to square this term 9 plus 
x. And 

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,620
we would have 

190
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,830
needed the binomial formula for this. 

191
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,310
However, as we have said several times , 
we don't need it now . And 

192
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,910
we now have x plus 4 equals 

193
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,970
81 and so, as 

194
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,050
we said at the beginning, we are now 

195
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,270
rid of our root equation. This is now 

196
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,350
a very simple linear equation 

197
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,250
, which we can now solve. We 

198
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,870
now calculate minus 4, then we have 

199
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,450
x equals 81 minus 4, 77. That's 

200
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,830
the solution to our 

201
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,870
equation for now. However, we shouldn 

202
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,090
't give the solution yet, 

203
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,970
because we don't even know whether the 

204
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,290
solution is possible. This means that we 

205
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,770
now have to 

206
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,010
carry out step 4 , which is the test, and 

207
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,290
the first thing we have to do is check 
whether the 

208
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,410
solution even 

209
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,150
lies in our definition set. 

210
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,770
First, in step 1, 

211
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,830
we determined the definition set and came 
to 

212
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,990
the conclusion that the 

213
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,530
equation 

214
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,010

215
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,790
is defined for all x's or the root for all 
x's that are greater than or equal to 
minus 4 . We now have 

216
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,710
77 as the solution, which is definitely 

217
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,310
greater than minus 4, so 

218
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,270
our root is already 

219
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,130
defined for it and the result 

220
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,550
also seems to be correct 

221
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,690
we can now 

222
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,490
prove the whole thing by means of the test 
, i.e. we simply put 

223
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,610
in our solution for our x our 

224
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,950
initial equation was twice 

225
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,930
brackets open the root of x plus 4 

226
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,070
minus 2 brackets closed is equal to 14 and 

227
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,250
for this x we now put 

228
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,610
in 77, so we get 2 times, 

229
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,610
brackets open, the root of 77 plus 4 

230
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,550
minus 2, brackets closed, is equal to 14. 

231
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,710
77 plus 4, that's what we work out, 

232
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,130
don't 

233
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,750
take the roots individually now , because 
that won't work. And 

234
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,410
77 plus 4 is then 81, 

235
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,290
we can take the root of 81, which is 

236
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,410
9. That's why in the next 

237
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,630
step there are only 2 times parentheses 

238
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,590
open 9 minus 2 parentheses closed is equal 
to 

239
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,150
14. Now we work out what's 

240
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,630
inside the parentheses. This means that 

241
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,430
9 minus 2 is 7 and 2 times 7 is 14, 

242
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,670
which means that everything is correct. 

243
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,770
The solution to the equation is really 77, 

244
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,030
and that's the 

245
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,830
end of the problem. 

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
That brings us to the end 

247
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
of the webinar. Thank you 

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
very much for your attention.
