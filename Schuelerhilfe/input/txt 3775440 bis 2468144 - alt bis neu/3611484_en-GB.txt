Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,380
Rounding. In this webinar, we will be 
looking at 

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,900
rounding. 

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,420
We will first 

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,060
look at rounding to tens, then rounding 

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,340
to hundreds and rounding to 

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,480
thousands. At the very end, we will 

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,020

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,040
demonstrate rounding again using a 
slightly larger number. 

10
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,680
This means mixed, i.e. we round 

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,960
once to tens, hundreds and 

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,540
thousands in the example. And 

13
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,160
thus show the differences. Let's start 
with 

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,700
something general about rounding 

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,040
. Rounding is needed to 

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,680

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,700
achieve a simple representation of 
numbers. This means that 

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,320
, especially with large numbers, you 

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
might 

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,180
limit yourself to the essentials and do 
without an exact 

21
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,840
result. This means that 

22
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,340
you may 

23
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,980
round some digits that are far behind, so 
that 

24
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,200
you can process the number better, 

25
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,200
perhaps also remember it better 

26
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,560
or 

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,000
carry out a rough calculation with it. is 

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,480
rounded . Rounding 

29
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,200
is not that difficult in itself. You 

30
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,580
just have to follow two important rules. 
The 

31
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,800
first is that you always look at the 

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,360
number after the 

33
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,740
digit you 

34
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,240
want to round up to. This means that if we 
want to 

35
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,660
round to tens, we look 

36
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,100
at the digit to the right of it, the 

37
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,380
ones. If we 

38
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,760
want to round to hundreds, we look 

39
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,320
at the digit to the right, the tens. 

40
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,360
If we want to round to thousands, 

41
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,820
we also look at the 

42
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,540
place to the right of it 

43
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,220
, the hundreds. It is important to note 

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,340
that only the one digit to the right of 

45
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,060
it applies and it is only 

46
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,560
rounded once. I will 

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,320

48
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,440
show this again in a moment with the 
rounds to hundreds and rounds to thousands 
and 

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,060
mention what I mean by this. 

50
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,540
Rounding is only ever done once and 

51
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,940
you only ever look at the 

52
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,440
digit to the right of the digit that 

53
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,200
is to be rounded. The second 

54
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
important rule is the rule on how 

55
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,120
to round. All numbers, 

56
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,180
either from 0, 1, 2, 3 up to 

57
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,320
and including 4, are rounded down. 

58
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,160
This also means that all 

59
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,640
numbers smaller than 5 are 

60
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,020
rounded down. Or then they are 

61
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,900
rounded down. If the number is a 5, 6, 

62
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,960
7, 8 or 9, it is 

63
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,380
rounded up. In other words, if the number 

64
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,040
is less than a 5, it is rounded down; 

65
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,400
if it is greater than a 5, it is 

66
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,820
rounded up. It is important to note that 
we are 

67
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,240
always talking about the number 

68
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,020
to the right of the digit to be rounded 

69
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,720
. Let's start with rounding to 

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,380
tens. As I said, here 

71
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,760
again is the rule for rounding 

72
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,520
. If the one digit 

73
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,500
is less than 5, it is rounded down. If 

74
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,780
one digit is equal to or greater than 5 

75
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,520
, it is rounded up. As I said, 

76
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,900
because we are rounding to 10s, let's look 

77
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,920
at the 1s. These are the 

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,280
1s here , we want to round to the 10s 

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,900
. As we have already 

80
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,780
said several times, the 1s are the digit 
to the right 

81
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,100
of the 10s. Well, the 1s in 

82
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,860
the 723 are a 3. The 3 is smaller than 

83
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,160
the 5, so it is rounded down and 

84
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
we get a 720. 

85
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,010
The next number we have is the 48. 

86
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,650
This means that we are looking at 

87
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,910
the 1s again, which in this case are 

88
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,930
an 8. The 8 is larger than the 5, 

89
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,050
so it is rounded up. So we go 

90
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,730
to the next larger 10 and 

91
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,160
that is the 50. Next we 

92
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,780
have the 574. The 1 here is 

93
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,840
a 4. The 4 is smaller than the 5, 

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,820
so we round down to 570. 

95
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,910
Here we have an example that 

96
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,270
often causes problems. We have 

97
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,730
the 96. The 6 is greater than the 5, so it 
is 

98
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,830
rounded up. 

99
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,990
We already know this so far. The only 

100
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,890
problem is that we can 

101
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,930
no longer increase the 10s because we 

102
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,210
already have the 9. That's why we have to 

103
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,570
open up the next 100s. And 96 is 

104
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,970
therefore 100 rounded up. 

105
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,250
Next we have the 455. Here 

106
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,110
we look at the right-hand 5, i.e. the 

107
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,650
1s. And 5, as we have just 

108
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,210
learned, is rounded up from 5... and 

109
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,230
we have a 5 there, so 

110
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,770
we round up the 455 and get the 

111
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,190
460. 

112
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,930
And that brings us to the 

113
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,550
rounds to hundreds. Rounding to 

114
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,370
hundreds actually works 

115
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,110
in exactly the same way. The only 
important thing now is that when 

116
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,170
we round to hundreds, we look 

117
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,670
at the tens digit. 

118
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,610
If the tens digit is less than 5, 

119
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,370
we round down and if the tens 

120
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,910
digit is greater than or equal to 5, we 

121
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,670
round up. It is important to remember what 

122
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,110
I said at the beginning: 

123
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,990
the 1 digit is not 

124
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,330
important, we 

125
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,710
don't look at it at all. This means that 
we now want to 

126
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,550
round the 723 to 100, so 

127
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,890
we only look at the 2. It 

128
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,890
doesn't matter what the digit is here. 

129
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,470
We have the 723, we are 

130
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,510
only looking at the 10, because we want to 

131
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,650
round to 100. This is the second 

132
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,070
digit from the right, the tens always. 

133
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,630
And in this case we have 2. 2 

134
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,290
is smaller than 5, so we 

135
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,330
round down and we get 700. 

136
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,050
So if we round to hundreds, 

137
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,930
then there is 

138
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,370
only 0 after the hundreds digit . That's 
always the case. 

139
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,030
Just like when we just rounded to tens 

140
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,610
, 

141
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,790
there was only a 0 after the tens digit 

142
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,100
. Next we have 248. This 

143
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,240
is an example of what I 

144
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,820
meant earlier. 

145
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,280
If we were to round twice now , we would 

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,820
round up the 8 , i.e. first 

147
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,940
round to the 10 , we would have a 5 here. 

148
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,240
And if we then 

149
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
rounded to the 100s , we would round up. 

150
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,660
We don't do that. 

151
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,940
We only ever round once and 

152
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,380
therefore only ever consider the 

153
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,180
digit to the right of the digit that 

154
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,820
is to be rounded. So if 

155
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,360
you want to round to 100, the 10 

156
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,600
digit . This is a 4 here 

157
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,860
, so it doesn't matter that there is 

158
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,260
an 8 here. This is a 4. The 4 

159
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,960
is smaller than the 5, so 

160
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,400
we have to round down to 200. Next 

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
we have the 574. Here we have the 

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,280
10's 7 and the 7 is greater than the 

163
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,620
5, so we simply round up. 

164
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,920
Next, we have another 

165
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,000
example that often 

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,860
causes problems , the 996. Here, too, 

167
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,720
we look at the 10s, i.e. the 9 

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,160
and the 9 is greater than the 5, so we 

169
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,920
round up. This means we 

170
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,700
want to increase the 100s by 1. 

171
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,740
But we can't do that because we 

172
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,540
already have a 9 there , so 996 is 

173
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,220
rounded up to 1000. Then we just have to 

174
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,720
increase the 1000s by 1. 

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
can no longer increase the 100s because 
there 

176
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,820
is already a 9 there. In this case, 

177
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,940
we have a 5 in the 10s 

178
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,280
. Therefore 5 equals 5 and we 

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,920
have learned when to 

180
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,540
round up. Therefore, the 455 is 

181
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,820
rounded to 500, which brings us to 
rounding 

182
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,900
to thousands. 

183
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,360
When rounding to thousands 

184
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,460
, we also look at the digit 

185
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,980
to the right of it, which is the 

186
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,760
100 digit . If this is less than 

187
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,560
5, it is rounded down and if it 

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,500
is equal to or greater than 5, it is 

189
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,920
rounded up. 

190
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,480
As I said, we are only interested in 

191
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
the 100s, not the 10s 

192
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,840
or the 1s. 

193
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,740
Here we have 3423. 100 is 

194
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,200
always the third digit from the right. 

195
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,920
The third digit from the right is the 

196
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,300
first, second and third. 

197
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,440
In this case it is the 4, which 

198
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,040
is our hundreds. The 4 is 

199
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,020
smaller than the 5, so it is 

200
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,580
rounded down and 3423 is rounded down 

201
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,760
to 3000. Next we have the 

202
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,240
6758. The 7 is our 

203
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,380
hundreds digit and the 7 is larger 

204
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,920
than the 5, so in 

205
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,540
this case it is rounded up to the next 
largest 

206
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,340
thousand. That would be 7000 

207
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,040
. 7455 gives us 4 hundreds. The 4 

208
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,740
is smaller than the 5, so it is 

209
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,840
rounded down to 7000 

210
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,850
. Next we have 

211
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,070
the 9612 again . We have 

212
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,890
a 6 in the hundreds, which means it is 

213
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,870
rounded up to the next largest 

214
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,310
thousand. But we already have 

215
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,290
the 9, which means we now have to round up 
to the 

216
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,890
next highest ten thousand. And that 

217
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,770
number is 10,000. So 9612 

218
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,950
rounded up to thousands gives us 10 

219
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,810
,000. 

220
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,970
Next we have the number 

221
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,610
1574. Here we have 500s and we 

222
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,050
have learned to 

223
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,790
round up at 5 and so we get 

224
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,250
2000 rounded up. 

225
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,630
That brings us to 

226
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,850
mixed rounding. 

227
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,450
Here we see the same number 3 times. It's 

228
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,750
467,372 and we want to find the... 

229
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,910
round it to tens, 

230
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,070
hundreds and thousands. And 

231
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,090
we have learned that when we round to 

232
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,110
tens, we 

233
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,310
just look at the units. As 

234
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,670
I said , this is the first digit from the 
right, 

235
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,030
i.e. the two. The two is smaller 

236
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,330
than the five. So we have to 

237
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,590
round down to 467,370. And I think 

238
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,110
you can see that the more we 

239
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,670
round, the more compact the number becomes 

240
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,610
and the easier it is to 

241
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,790
remember . That's also a 

242
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,130
big factor. Right, next 

243
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,110
we want to round to hundreds 

244
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,030
, so let's round the 467,372 to 

245
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,250
hundreds. To do this, let's take a look 

246
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,750
at the 10s. 

247
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,410
As mentioned, the 10s are the second digit 
from the right, 

248
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,330
in this case the 7. The 7 is 

249
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,210
greater than the 5, so let's 

250
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,890
first round up to greater than and 
hundredths 

251
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,430
, i.e. the 3 becomes a 4 and 

252
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:59,250
we arrive at 467,400. Finally 

253
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,650
, we round again to the 

254
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,790
thousands, i.e. we look 

255
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,290
at the hundreds digit in this case, 

256
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,670
which is 

257
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,110
the third digit from the right, as we said 
earlier , i.e. 

258
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,390
the 3, and we realize that we have 

259
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,370
a 3, the 3 is smaller than the 

260
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,090
five, so we round down 

261
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,050
to 467,000 and that is 

262
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,270
a number that is easy to remember 

263
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,250
and still accurate 

264
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,350
enough, which brings us to the end of the 

265
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,630
webinar thank you for your 

266
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,290
attention
