1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,300
In this video I would like to briefly 

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,780

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,140
explain the working time documentation 
during short-time work. 

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,820
The following list is provided 

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,700
and used by you. 

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,540
It contains the month, surname and 

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,520
first name, client number and 

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,840
personnel number. This will be 

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,000
filled in for you beforehand . And it is 
important to 

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,860
know how many working days 

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,060
I 

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,840
had per week before the short-time work 
and how many during the 

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,260
short-time work. You also need to 

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,600
enter how much overtime 

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,320
you still have in your 

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,560
account with the note that this 

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,280

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,220

19
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,800
must be zero in the first month of 
short-time working , in this case in June. 
We have 

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,100
included a checkbox here for this purpose 
, which 

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,540
turns green as soon as it 

22
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,000
reaches zero. As an 

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,280
example, we now have a 

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,300
full-time employee who 

25
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,900

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,160
will reduce his working hours from five to 
four days a week , with Monday being the 

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,980
short-time working day. First, 

28
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,900
you have to go there as a 

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,040
full-time employee working 40 hours per 
week and 

30
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,780

31
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,960
enter your planned working hours every 
day. For a 

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,020
full-time employee , this is 8 

33
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,100
hours a day , 8 times 5 equals 40 hours. 

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,360
And then it is your task to 

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,520

36
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,980

37
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,600
distribute these target hours to these 
different fields on each day of short-time 
work , so that 

38
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,080
the total comes back to 8 and the 

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,460
control field here turns green. 

40
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,520
Well, let's just do this 

41
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,180
as an example. In this case, Monday, 

42
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,760
June 1, is a public holiday. 

43
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,660
So we enter an 8 for public holiday. 

44
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,820
The hours are scheduled, the field 

45
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
turns green. Now we have 

46
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,300
already said that the short-time working 
day 

47
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,360
this week is Monday. This means that 

48
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,660

49
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,300
we will work normally on Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. You 

50
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,480
enter the 8, the control field 

51
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,860
turns green. The week has been 

52
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,540
entered correctly. In the next 

53
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,800
week, the short-time working day is 

54
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,020
Monday again. You enter the eight 

55
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,520
hours for short-time working. The day 

56
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,860
is entered correctly. 

57
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,260
You work on Tuesday , 

58
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,540
you work on Wednesday and there is 

59
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,300
a public holiday on Thursday in this 
example week. 

60
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,640
You enter the public holiday hours again 

61
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,020
and you work on Friday. That 

62
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,620
would be the second week. Now 

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,700
we come to special cases. The next 

64
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,260
week you are on sick leave. 

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,780
The whole week. You enter the 

66
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,180
eight hours every day. Here too, the 

67
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,160
list turns green. Then the next week you 
are 

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,940
on vacation. The same topic. You 

69
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,900
enter eight hours on each vacation day 

70
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,960
. Your target hours from 

71
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,260
the beginning. You are at zero. On Monday 

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,960
, another short-time working day is 

73
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,240
scheduled. And on Tuesday we do 

74
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,200
another variation. 

75
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,080
We'll say, okay, you'll only 

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,280
work four hours and 

77
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,760
reduce your workload by four hours. So now 

78
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
we wouldn't have 

79
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,220
paid much attention this month , because 
there's 

80
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,300
still 20 

81
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,000
hours of overtime left up there. In other 
words, 

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,040
we should have 

83
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,180
done things differently in the current 
month. We're 

84
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,980
just making an example here. What could we 
have 

85
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,480
done, for example? You could 

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,400
say, I'm simply 

87
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
not going to take any vacation hours here, 
but 

88
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,920
I'll... here more hours then 

89
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,580
of course here no more but now 

90
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,380
here my goal achieved I have 

91
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,960

92
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,140
reduced my 24 more hours in the current 
month the control field is green 

93
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,920
and I see at the end of the month how 

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,740
many hours I have really 

95
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,180
worked how many hours have 

96
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,440
been lost due to short-time work how many 

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,860
hours I was sick how many 

98
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,240
hours I have on vacation 

99
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,540
holiday hours reduction overtime 

100
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,000
and thus this month would be finished 

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,260
the list is sent on the first 

102
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,720
working day of the following month to 

103
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,600
time recording.schülerhilfe.de or 

104
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,540
if you already know that you will be 

105
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,560
on vacation at the end of the month, 

106
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
you can of course 

107
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
fill in the list in advance and send it to 
us 

108
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,420
earlier. 

109
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,900
However, it is important that we receive 
it before 

110
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,060
you go on vacation. Now 

111
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,500
let's take a look at the example 

112
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,100
of a part-time employee. 

113
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,920
Here we now have an 

114
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,420
employee who 

115
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,160
works 25 hours per week. That's the total 
of these 

116
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,300
hours. And he comes in 

117
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,740
three days instead of four. Without 
short-time working 

118
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,780
, he would have worked Monday, 

119
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,680
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. On 

120
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,060
the three days during short-time working 

121
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,540
, he only comes in on Monday, Tuesday 

122
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,880
and Wednesday and Friday is 

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,240
short-time working. So, Monday 

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,660
is a working day, but here it is also 

125
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,640
a public holiday, so he 

126
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,040
enters a 6 , his planned hours. 

127
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,120
Of course, he has to 

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,200
maintain this beforehand as well. How many 
planned hours do 

129
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,760
I actually have on which day? This 

130
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,620
employee always comes in for 6 hours and 

131
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,800
one hour longer on Tuesday. 

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,480
You will 

133
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,540
know their target hours individually and 
can 

134
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,800
enter them here. So, on Tuesday he should 

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,040
continue to come, enter a 7. 

136
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,140
On Wednesday he should continue to 

137
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,560
come in, enter a 6. And on 

138
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,860
Friday is the 

139
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,300
employee 's short-time working day , he 
enters a 6 here 

140
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,080
. So it's basically the same as 

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,180
we've just seen with full-time 

142
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,420
. So, the next week, he 

143
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,360
might 

144
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,120
not come in on Monday either because he's 
cutting back more hours. 

145
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,460
They work on Tuesday, they work on 

146
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,360
Wednesday. Now 

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,840
we have a public holiday here on Thursday. 

148
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,280
But this employee 

149
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,680
has never worked on Thursday 

150
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
. As a result, he has 

151
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,540
zero planned hours on Thursday and 

152
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,340
does not enter anything in this column 
either. So, 

153
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,500
Friday is the 

154
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,040
short-time working day again. Short-time 
work is 

155
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,480
recorded. If the employee 

156
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,120
is now on vacation, he naturally 

157
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,440
only enters vacation where he 

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,020
has planned hours. This means that 

159
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,340
the number of 

160
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,740
vacation days taken per week 

161
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,020
does not change despite short-time 
working. The employee with 

162
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,820
four working days 

163
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,460
continues to take four vacation days for 
the 

164
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,520
week. And the 

165
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,940
full-time employee continues to take five 

166
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,920
working days for the week. In other words, 
exactly 

167
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
as if there had been no short-time working 

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,780
. So now we can 

169
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,200
say here again, oh, I've only 

170
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,040
taken six more hours off. 

171
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,160
I still have six more hours to go. Then 

172
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
he stays at 

173
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,760
home again on Monday , reduces more hours, 
works 

174
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,380
on Tuesday, works on Wednesday, 

175
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,440
goes into short-time working on Friday. 
And 

176
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,500
here he 

177
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,220
works regular hours again on Monday and 
Tuesday. So 

178
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,740
this week is also completely taken care of 
here. 

179
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,720
Now we have another 

180
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,000
special case. It is possible 

181
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,500
that the employee may 

182
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
not 

183
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,360
work seven hours on Tuesday, but eight 

184
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,420
hours. Then, of course, 

185
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,100
the control field here turns red and 

186
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,840
doesn't match . On the one hand, of 
course, I 

187
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,720
then have to say that I have 

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,060
worked eight hours , so should and must 

189
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,000
match again and now 

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,440
the weekly total no longer matches . 

191
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,800
Now I no longer had 25 hours 

192
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
, but 26. It is important 

193
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,900
that this working time 

194
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,680
is made up again in the monthly balance , 
i.e. that 

195
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,280
less 

196
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,540
is worked on another day . 

197
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,860
No new overtime may 

198
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,360
be built up during short-time working. 

199
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,660
They are flexible within the month. At the 
end of the month, 

200
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,480
no new overtime hours may 

201
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,940
be accrued. And 

202
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
, as I said, existing hours must 

203
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,660
be reduced in the first month of 
short-time working. These 

204
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,100
were the brief examples on the subject of 

205
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,500
how I document my 

206
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,140
working hours during short-time working. 

207
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,140
As I said, once this has been done, 

208
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
please send this list as an Excel file to 

209
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,860
zeiterfassung 

210
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,660

211
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,180

212
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,320

213
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,260

214
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,920
.schülerhilfe .de , print it out, sign it, 
present it to the respective manager for 
signature and also send it scanned to 
zeiterfassung.schülerhilfe.de 

215
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,780
so that we 

216
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,760

217
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,100

218
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,960
can file it properly here in the HR 
department in Gelsenkirchen . If you have 
any questions about the 

219
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,460
working time documentation on this 

220
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,400
list, please 

221
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,020
contact your line manager in the first 
step, 

222
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,060
who will also be familiar with it, and in 
the second 

223
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
step you can of course 

224
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,880
also contact us in the HR department 

225
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,400
. Thank you for your 

226
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,520
attention and have a 

227
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:15,880
nice day.
