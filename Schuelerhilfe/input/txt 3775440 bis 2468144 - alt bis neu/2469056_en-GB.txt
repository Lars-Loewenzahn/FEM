00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,600
Hello, my name is Sabrina and I 

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,020
am a tutor 

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,320
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
give you 

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,720
an insight into the topic of 

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,220
electron pair bonding. 

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,060
In our online learning center, you will 

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,860
of course also find a 

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,860
wiki on this topic , in which the 

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,260
most important terms 

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,340
are explained to you once again . In an 

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,260
electron pair bond 

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,500
, atoms come so close together that their 
shells 

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,480
overlap slightly so that they 

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,740

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,180
can share an electron pair, i.e. two 
electrons. 

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,340
There is now an 

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,000
electron pair or atomic bond between these 
two atoms 

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,280
, which makes them into a molecule. 

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,720
The atoms are firmly bonded 

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,840
and can only 

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,480

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,540
be separated again by expending a great 
deal of energy. The reason for the 
formation 

23
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,580
of an electron pair bond is the 

24
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,160
striving of the elements for a 

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,500
completely filled outer shell, as is the 
case with 

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,780
the noble gases, the elements of the 

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,580
eighth main group. This 

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,220
striving drives the atoms to 

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,600
bond with others. With a 

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
full outer shell, the particles are 

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,020
energetically very stable, which is why 
they 

32
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,560
form bonds to 

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,060
achieve this state. The only 

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,120
elements that do not strive for bonding 

35
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,820
and 

36
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,100
are therefore extremely inert are the 

37
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,560
noble gases themselves. They naturally 
have 

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,380
the full outer shell. If you are 

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,520
not 

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,580
familiar with the noble gas configuration 
, we 

41
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,500
also have an explanatory video. 

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,740

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,400

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,520
You can see how many outer electrons an 
atom has and how many electrons it lacks 
for the full outer shell 

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,000
in the periodic table, or PSE for short. 

46
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,520
The main group number corresponds to the 

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,080
number of outer electrons, with the 
exception 

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,120
of helium, which has 2 

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,800
electrons instead of 8. The main groups 

50
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,280
are the columns of the PSE, which 

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,980

52
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,780
are also numbered from 1 to 8. If an 
element is in 

53
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,280
the 5th main group, it has 5 

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,480
outer electrons and is missing 

55
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,280
a further 3 electrons for the 

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,180
noble gas configuration. Let's take a look 
at 

57
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,380
the simplest example, a 

58
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,000
hydrogen molecule, which is made up of two 

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,100
hydrogen atoms 

60
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,480
that share a pair of electrons. 

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
In this way, hydrogen achieves 

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,560
the electron configuration of the noble 
gas 

63
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,040
helium. To represent the 

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,400
electron pair bonds, 

65
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,280
we use the Lewis or 

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,440
valence dash notation here. There is also 

67
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960

68
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,220
a separate short video 

69
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,620
explaining this notation . If an 

70
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,680
oxygen atom now wants to 

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
achieve the noble gas configuration, 

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
which it can do by 

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,340

74
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,700
bonding with another atom of its element , 
it must form two electron pair 

75
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,140
bonds with these atoms in order 

76
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,680

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,380
to obtain the configuration of neon . 
These two 

78
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,260
electron pair bonds between two 

79
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,020
atoms are called double bonds 

80
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,100
. However, so-called 

81
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,760
triple bonds are also 

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
possible between two atoms 

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,660
, as can be seen in the example of the 
nitrogen molecule. 

84
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,860
Each nitrogen atom is three 

85
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,180
electrons short of the full 

86
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,400
outer shell, which is why it 

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,420

88
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,100
forms three electron pair bonds with the 
other nitrogen atom. 

89
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,580
Both reach the configuration of 

90
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,660
neon. It can be seen 

91
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,640

92
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,980
that as many 

93
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,620
electron pair bonds 

94
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,460
are formed between two atoms of the same 
element as each atom 

95
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,420

96
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,040
lacks electrons to reach the noble gas 
configuration . 

97
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,580
However, more than one triple bond cannot 

98
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,540
be formed between two atoms, which 

99
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,700
means that atoms that are missing more 
than 

100
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,740
three electrons for the 

101
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,660
noble gas configuration 

102
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,360

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,540
must form electron pair bonds with more 
than one other atom. 

104
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,160
We can look at this using 

105
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,520
carbon as an example. Carbon 

106
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,380
must 

107
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,220
form four electron pair bonds. These can 
be four 

108
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,680
single bonds, two 

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,860
double bonds or one 

110
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,640
single and one triple bond 

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,860
. 

112
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,780
Electron pair bonds can also be used 

113
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,240

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,740
to build long-chain or complex molecules . 

115
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,120
It is always important to ensure that the 

116
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,960
noble gas configuration is achieved. 

117
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,140
The octet rule is usually applied here , 
which 

118
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,480
states that an atom requires 8 

119
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,700
outer electrons. 

120
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,560
With the exception of hydrogen and 

121
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,420
helium , of course, which 

122
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,080
can carry a maximum of 2 outer electrons . 
If you now 

123
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,040

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320

125
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,500
look at the elements of the first three 
main groups, with the exception of 
hydrogen, it becomes clear that 

126
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,620
they 

127
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,760
cannot 

128
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,140
achieve the noble gas configuration 
through electron pair bonds , as a 
particle 

129
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,180

130
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,780

131
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,460

132
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,560

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,700
must also carry at least four outer 
electrons to form four electron pair bonds 
or electron pairs. This 

134
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,660

135
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,700
does not apply to the elements of the 
first three main groups , which is why the 
atoms of these 

136
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,200
elements rarely 

137
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,420
form electron pair bonds and 

138
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,600
instead form ionic bonds. 

139
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,860
In these bonds, the 

140
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,560
atoms with few electrons act as 

141
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,320
electron donors and give up all 

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,540
their outer electrons, 1 to 3, to 

143
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,620
acceptors so that they 

144
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,160

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,340

146
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,700
reach the noble gas configuration of the 
noble gas of the next smaller period . In 
the PSE, the 

147
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,100
periods are the rows, numbered here 

148
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,480
from 1 to 7. 

149
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,220
You can also find 

150
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,000
more videos on the subject of ions and 
ionic bonding in our online 

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,820
 learning center. I hope I was able to 

152
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,200
give you a better understanding of what 

153
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,080
electron pair bonds are and 

154
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,020
what purpose they serve. If you have 

155
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,580

156
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,580
topics, please feel free to contact
