00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,220
Hello, my name is Sabrina and I 

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,760
am a tutor 

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,080
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain to you 

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,780
what electrolysis is all about in 
chemistry. 

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,620
In our online learning center, you can 

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,500
of course also find a 

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,240
wiki on this topic, where the 

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,580
most important terms 

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,660
are explained to you once again . 
Lead-acid batteries, 

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,300
also known as starter batteries, are 

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,900
still installed in many cars today 

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,460
. They 

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,300
give off electricity when discharged . 
However, 

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,620
electricity is needed to recharge them 

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,120
, which also involves 

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,640
electrolysis. In general, 

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,020
electrolysis 

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,960
can be defined as follows. A 

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,980
redox reaction in which oxidation and 

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,080
reduction take place spatially separated 

22
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,960
and which 

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,760
is forced by the supply of electrical 
energy. 

24
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,880
To carry out an electrolysis 

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,940
, you therefore need a reaction chamber, 

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,560
a power source, two electrodes, 

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,260
an anode and a cathode, an electrolyte and 

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,460
the reactants. 

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,520
It should be noted that both the 
electrodes 

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,800
and the electrolyte often act as 

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,260
reactants. If we 

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,260
stay with the lead-acid battery, the 

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,960
structure looks like this. Our reaction 
chamber is 

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,000

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,640
filled with diluted sulphuric acid, the 
electrolyte. The electrodes, 

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,100
in this case consisting of lead sulphate 

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,940
, are immersed and connected 

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,760
to each other via the current source. 

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,180
The negative pole is the cathode and the 
positive pole 

40
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,320
is the anode. When the current is now 

41
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,400
switched on, two 

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
electrons are 

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,440
transported from the anode to the cathode. 
The anode 

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,560
releases electrons, which is why 

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,620
oxidation takes place here , and the 

46
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,580
cathode absorbs the electrons 

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,380
, which is why reduction 

48
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,260
takes place here. Let us now 

49
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,780
set up the reaction equation. First 

50
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,140
the partial reaction, starting with the 

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,920
reduction. The solid lead sulphate 

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,460
receives two electrons and reacts 

53
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,840
to form lead and a dissolved sulphate ion. 

54
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,360
During oxidation, the 

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,880
lead sulphate reacts with water. 

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Lead oxide, dissolved sulphate ions and 

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,800
protons as well as two electrons are 
formed . The 

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
overall equation is therefore: 

59
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,300
2PbSO4 and 2H2O react to form PbO2, 

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,280
Pb, 2SO4-2 and 4H+. The 

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,520
dissolved sulphate ions and protons 

62
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,420
together produce sulphuric acid, i.e. our 

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,820
electrolyte. The summary. 1. 

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,500
electrolysis describes a 

65
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,980
forced redox reaction, which is why 

66
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,780
an electrical energy source 

67
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,460
is required. 2. the redox reactions 

68
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,400
take place spatially separated at the 

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
electrodes. 3 The negative pole 

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,500
corresponds to the cathode, where the 

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,520
reduction takes place. 4. the positive 
pole 

72
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,560
corresponds to the anode, where 

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
oxidation takes place. And fifthly, 

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
the electrodes and the electrolyte 

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,660
often serve as reactants. I 

76
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,300
hope this video has helped you to 

77

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,300
electrolysis. If you have any further
