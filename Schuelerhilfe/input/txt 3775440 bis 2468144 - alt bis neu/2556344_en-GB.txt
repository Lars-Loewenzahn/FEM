00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,650
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,870
Schülerhilfe webinar. 

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,610
Today we will be looking at the topic of 

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,130
sentence elements in sentence recognition. 

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,790
So we're going to look at the main 

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,510
clauses 

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,270
, the predicate, the 

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,350
subject and the object, and 

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,730
then we'll look at the 

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,550
subordinate clauses 

11
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,310
, namely the attributes and the 

12
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,730
adverbials. Finally, we will 

13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,070

14
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,390
look again at the special feature of the 
predicate. The 

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,330
predicate is the principal 

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,250
clause element. This means that the 
predicate 

17
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,150
is a conjugated, i.e. 

18
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,510
inflected verb. It therefore 

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,630
contains all the necessary content for a 

20
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,030
sentence. On the one hand, we have the 

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,970
tense sign, which means we know 

22
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,170
which tense the sentence is in, 

23
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,990
and we have a personalization, 

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,530
which means we know which person 

25
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,670
and how many of these persons 

26
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,290
are doing something. This means that with 
the help of 

27
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,250
the tense marker and the 

28
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,390
personal ending, we already have 

29
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,530
all the basic, i.e. the 

30
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,490
most necessary information about 

31
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,610
a sentence. In addition, the 

32
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,670
predicate also determines which other 

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,710
sentence elements can occur in the 
sentence. 

34
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,270
This is called transitivity. 

35
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,850
There are some verbs that 

36
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,650
automatically need an accusative or they 

37
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,370
need a dative or a 

38
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,530
genitive. This means that they have a 

39
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,470
case reaction. This means that they 

40
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,930
govern 

41
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,050
together with a certain object. We also 
know this from 

42
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,150
German, for example with the verb 

43
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,330
backen. To bake something. This means 

44
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,350

45
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,810
that we also need an 

46
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,390
accusative object to be able to construct 
this sentence completely. I am baking a 

47
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,450
cake. In addition, the 

48
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,710
predicate or the conjugated verb, 

49
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,030
i.e. the adapted verb, which 

50
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,610
is called the predicate in the sentence, 

51
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,710
contains further content, such 

52
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,350
as the fifth element of the 

53
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,490
verb, namely the genus verbi, the 

54
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,230
gender of the verb. We 

55
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,130
only know the gender of nouns and 

56
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,730
adjectives by distinguishing between 

57
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,470
masculine, feminine and neuter 

58
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,250
. The gender of the 

59
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,010
verb is not limited to 

60
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,290
masculine, feminine or neuter 

61
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,950
, but is differentiated, i.e. it 

62
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,230
only differs in being active 

63
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,410
or passive. This means 

64
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,550
that with an active predicate , 

65
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,110
the basic sentence order of subject 

66
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,190
- object - predicate applies  in Latin. 

67
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,890
In German, we have the 

68
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,170
 subject-predicate-object clause order. 

69
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,070
With the passive predicate 

70
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,950
, the sentence order shifts. 

71
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,870
This means that the subject, which 

72
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,430
was the former 

73
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,610
accusative object from the active sentence 
, goes first and 

74
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,470
is carried out by the passive. We will 

75
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,970
look at this again later 

76
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,610
. In addition to the content of the 

77
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,210
genus verbi, we also have the 

78
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,410
information of the silent subject. 

79
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,490
We have just learned that 

80
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,770
the personal ending already tells 

81
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,570
us who or what is doing something. 

82
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,470
This means that, unless we 

83
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,170
want to make it explicit, 

84
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,330
it is sufficient if we only 

85
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,770
write the predicate and then an object 
following it, 

86
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,010
if this is necessary. In other words, as 

87
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,350
we can see from the example here, 

88
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,710
the predicate already contains 

89
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,850
the subject. We can 

90
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,550
translate Rom am It as he is going to 
Rome. 

91
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,110
Of course, this depends on what 

92
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,970

93
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,750

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,730
is written in the context, i.e. in the 
previous sentence or in the introductory 
sentence. So that ultimately decides 

95
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,470
whether it says he is going 

96
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,250
to Rome or she is going to Rome. 

97
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,890
In Latin, this 

98
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,450
can only be determined by the context, 

99
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,370
unless it is explicitly written out. 

100
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,150
Because it is the third person, i.e. 

101
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,190
he, she or it in the singular. 

102
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,930
The predicate also contains 

103
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,330
predicate nouns and 

104
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,610
predicative nouns. This means 

105
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,350

106
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,270
that we can also do something with these 
predicative nouns and predicate nouns . 

107
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,950
However, we will 

108
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,210

109
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,850
deal with this at the end of this webinar 
. We will 

110
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,910
see that the predicate 

111
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,350

112
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,270

113
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,310
can also automatically lead us to a 
predicate noun or predicative . more on 
this later. 

114
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,650
Now let's move on to the subject. The 

115
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,430
subject is the primary sentence element, 

116
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,630
i.e. it is directly related 

117
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,510
to the predicate, precisely because it 

118
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,790
is already preformed in the predicate. 

119
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,710
This means that the subject provides 
information about 

120
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,090
the actor. He is the one who 

121
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,990

122
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,530
carries out this predicate, i.e. the 
action. A subject is a 

123
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,130
declined noun. This can 

124
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,750
also be a noun, i.e. a 

125
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,170
name word. The noun means 

126
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,590
name in Latin. This means that a 

127
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,330
noun is also a noun 

128
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,610
because it has a name. A subject 

129
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,710
fulfills the following criteria. It is 

130
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,510
in competition with the predicate, i.e. 

131
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,610
in direct relation. This means that it 

132
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,310
basically 

133
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,990
takes on all forms. If the predicate is in 
the singular 

134
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,870
, the nominative is also in the singular. 

135
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,850
And this becomes interesting later when 

136
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,050
we 

137
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,910
look at the translation of texts. We will 

138
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,710
see from the example in a moment that we 
can immediately 

139
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,770
determine which nominative we 

140
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,170
need to look for . In addition, 

141
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,770
we know that a subject 

142
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,990

143
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,070
can only and exclusively be declined in 
the nominative case . This means 

144
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,070
that all nouns that we are looking for 

145
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,450
can only be found in the 

146
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,150
nominative case and 

147
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,070
we have to differentiate whether it 

148
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,990
is in the singular or plural 

149
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,630
and we find this out via the 

150
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,530
predicate. The subject is always 

151
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,890

152
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,770
posed with the question who or what, i.e. 
quiz out quid. So, or 

153
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,710
determined. Let's look at the 

154
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,050
example. Puer et poella placentam 

155
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,230
coquunt, quiz coquit, pur et poella 

156
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,950
coquunt. We can see from the coquunt 

157
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,310
, i.e. the un-ending, i.e. the 

158
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,610
nt-ending, third person plural 

159
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,250
, that this 

160
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,930
should be a plural subject. Now we have 
here 

161
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,310
both a puer et puerla, both 

162
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,810
standing nouns in the ativsingua, 

163
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,510
but they are connected by the conjunction 

164
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,350
et. This means that we can 

165
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,890
conclude that these two 

166
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,590
are our performers here. 

167
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,030
Namely, they are the bakers 

168
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,690
, the ones who bake, that is, the boy and 
the 

169
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,870
girl who bake. So we ask, 

170
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,650
quiz, coquit, who bakes, poor Ed 

171
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,290
Puella, coquit, who bakes, the boy 

172
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,010
and the girl bake. We realize 

173
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,390
that the placentum 

174
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,310
is outside , because the placentum is the 

175
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,790
object. Moreover, we come now. The 

176
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,030
object is a secondary clause, 

177
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,650
that is, it describes the 

178
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,950
person being acted upon. It adds 
something, 

179
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,410
i.e. it is a supplementary 

180
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,990
subject of the sentence. The object is 
also 

181
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,820
a declined noun. It is, 

182
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,740
as I said, the person being acted upon 

183
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,400
, i.e. it is the person who 

184
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,380

185
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,900
is performed by the predicate, i.e. by the 
action. We 

186
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,380
therefore distinguish between the one who 

187
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,700
performs the action and the one who 

188
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,180
is performed. And the one who is basically 

189
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,900
the action. The one who 

190
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,280
is the action is the predicate, 

191
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,200
the performer is the subject and 

192
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,440
the performed is the object. It 

193
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,260
therefore 

194
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,200

195
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,700
adds a second noun, at least a second noun 
, to the sentence. It is the last of the 
three 

196
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,260
most important sentence elements. We 

197
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,740
therefore 

198
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,820
always proceed in the same order in our 
translation: 

199
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,400
we first look for the predicate, 

200
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,720
then 

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,380
make an inference to the subject and then 

202
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,380
look for the object. This 

203
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,120
sentence fragment is only needed if the 

204
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,860
predicate requires it. We 

205
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360
have already talked about the keyword 

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,040
transitivity. 

207
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,740
To summarize , the object fulfills the 
following 

208
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,620
criteria. An object is 

209
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,600
required by the predicate or is 

210
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,560
present as a complement in the sentence. 

211
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,800
It 

212
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
can be declined in all other cases except 
the 

213
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,860
nominative, because the nominative 

214
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,400
is reserved in the subject. 

215
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,980
However, we differentiate 

216
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,760
between direct and indirect objects 

217
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,180
. We will come to that now. Before 

218
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,960
we finally 

219
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,140

220
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,760
deal with the direct and indirect object , 
we need to 

221
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,700
clarify something first. We need to 

222
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,220
differentiate, i.e. distinguish 

223
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,740
between the 

224
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,520
different objects. 

225
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,160
Types of object. I 

226
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,560
don't mean the indirect and direct 

227
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
object, but between the 

228
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,060
attributes of an object. 

229
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,660
We define the accusative, the 

230
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,080
dative or the genitive or the 

231
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,440
applicative, which, unlike 

232
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,840
in German, is the 

233
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,040
fifth case in the language. 

234
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,680
Let's start with the most important and 

235
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,020
most common case, namely the 

236
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,800
accusative 

237
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,940
object . 

238
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,500
The object is in the fourth case 

239
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,540
, i.e. the accusative case. It 

240
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,180
usually takes on the function of the 

241
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,220
direct object. 

242
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
We will look at why in a moment. It 

243
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,300
also competes with the 

244
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,860
predicate, because the predicate in the 

245
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,380
accusative case 

246
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,460
also requires it. All 

247
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,160
transitive verbs without any further 

248
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,620
Our information require 

249
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,680
an accusative object. Otherwise, 

250
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
our vocabulary and 

251
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,580
dictionaries just 

252
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,800
add a dative or with a 

253
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,580
dative, i.e. m.dat, so that we know 

254
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,260
that it is formed with a dative 

255
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,760
or with a genitive or the 

256
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,160
aplative. Otherwise, we can 

257
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,780
generally assume that 

258
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,740
the verb is 

259
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,700
governed by an accusative . The accusative 
is asked 

260
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,480
with whom or what, so quem ausquit, 

261
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,900
we can see it here once in the 

262
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,780
example, Pirate, Navim, Capium, 

263
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,100
so we can determine Pirate is 

264
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,280
our subject, we can recognize that 

265
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,680
by the fact that we 

266
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,340
have the predicate in the plural here and 
here in this case 

267
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,240
Pirate is our actual and 

268
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,600
only plural form and then we have 

269
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,900
Navim in the accusative, so we can 

270
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,860
ask, Quem ad quid? Pirate, 

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
carpion. Who do the pirates capture? They 

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,220
capture the ship. This means that the 

273
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,960
ship is our accusative object. 

274
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,560
Now we come to the dative object. 

275
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,220
The dative object is usually placed after 

276
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,940
verbs to which an action applies. 

277
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,960
This means that here we no longer have 

278
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,720
an agent, but an 

279
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,500
originator or an addressee. We 

280
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,400
can see this in the example of Marcus 

281
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,900
Domino Impendit. 

282
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,120
This means that we assume that 

283
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,760
Marcus is threatening. Marcus threatens. 

284
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,460
However, we are not asking who 

285
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,880
he is threatening , but who he is 
threatening. And here 

286
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,920
we have a clear differentiation 

287
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,160
from the accusative, because here the 

288
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,840
threat, i.e. the action, goes to an 

289
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,380
addressee. So we either have 

290
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,100
an author and an addressee. 

291
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,160
In this case, an addressee 

292
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,300
, that is, to whom the action is 
addressed. 

293
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,460
The point is to threaten the master of the 
house. Who is 

294
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,740
Mark threatening? He is threatening the 
master of the house. 

295
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,360
If we have the phenomenon that two 

296
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,780
objects, one dative and one 

297
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,740
accusative, appear together in a sentence, 

298
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,880
we automatically have to 

299
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,100

300
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,200
deal with the direct and indirect object. 
What I would like to mention 

301
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
here is that the landlord is also a 

302
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,800
direct object, because the verb in 

303
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
empend, in this case 

304
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,780
empendit, necessarily has a 

305
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,760
dative case, i.e. it reacts 

306
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
with a dative, which means domino is 

307
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,320
the direct object. We will now look 

308
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,020
at an example in which both 

309
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,360
the one and the other occur 

310
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,500
, namely Filia Matri Epistolam 

311
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,280
Scribit. So we can ask, 

312
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,140
Filia Scribit, so we have 

313
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,160
Scribit here , third person singular 

314
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,120
, so we have a nominative here. 

315
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,800
of Filia, so we know the 

316
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,820
daughter is the one who 

317
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,680
forms the subject and now we ask ourselves 

318
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
Matria and Epistulam, two 

319
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
types of object, one dative, one 

320
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,960
accusative and now we have to 

321
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,080
determine who is what, who is 

322
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,880
direct and who is indirect. 

323
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,220
We can determine this by 

324
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,040
asking, Quem autquit filia 

325
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
scribit, Epistulam scribit, cui 

326
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,140
epistulam scribit, Matria epistulam 

327
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,180
scribit. We can see from 

328
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,500
the question alone that on the one hand we 
only 

329
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,880

330
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,980
have to include the subject in the 
question , but on the other hand we also 

331
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,520
have to include the accusative. 

332
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,880
We could also 

333
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,540
write it out, but we have learned 

334
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,660
that the subject is 

335
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,880
also formed within the predicate. 

336
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,980
This means that we don't have to 

337
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,040
explicitly write it out again here , 
because 

338
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,000
we are thinking here. 

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,220
However, we can state and 

340
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,860
realize that we 

341
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,040
still have the filia here. So we could 
also 

342
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,340
say that 

343
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,880
we could 

344
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,260
leave out the filia and make a quip 

345
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,840
out of skribit. Yes, we could 

346
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,060

347
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,160
translate this as sie in German , i.e. 
with a 

348
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,040
personal pronoun. So we see 

349
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
that the daughter is writing 

350
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,700
a letter to her mother. She writes, 

351
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,980
we' ve left it out here , a letter. Who is 

352
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,780
she writing to? To the mother. 

353
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,560
We can do that in German. 

354
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,520
But we can't actually say 

355
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,640
to whom she is writing or she is writing 

356
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,240
to her mother. That's not 

357
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,040
enough, because basically 

358
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,980
we 

359
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,220
project the writing onto something. This 

360
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,700
means that if the direct object and 

361
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,340
the indirect object 

362
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,780
are in the same sentence , we know that 
the direct 

363
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,080
object cannot be omitted 

364
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,740
, but the direct object can. 

365
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,780
The sentence would work if we 

366
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,700
said the mother was writing a 

367
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,340
letter, the sentence would not 

368
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,880
work if we said the daughter was writing 

369
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,740
to her mother. We would automatically 

370
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,960
ask who or what. So 

371
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,640
the direct object is missing here , in 
this case 

372
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,800
the accusative object. In most 

373
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
cases, unless the 

374
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,620
verb rules with a dative, 

375
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,640
the accusative 

376
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,400
forms the direct object and then, if 
present, 

377
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,960
the dative forms the indirect object. 

378
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,120
Now we come to the two other 

379
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,460
forms, namely the genitive and the 

380
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,180
applicative. The genitive object is 
required by 

381
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,640
only a few verbs. 

382
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,340
In most cases, it is 

383
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,320
also 

384
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,100

385
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,140
translated with a different case in German 
, i.e. with a different case . 

386
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,180
In Latin, for example, we mostly have 
verbs of 

387
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,960
remembering and forgetting 

388
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,260
that are formed with a genitive object. 

389
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,080
Well-known verbs are neminisses, formed as 

390
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,140
past infinitives, as 

391
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,580
there is no present tense. 

392
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,200
Mercator, Pirate, Neminid. The 

393
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,080
merchant remembers his 

394
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,760
homeland is 

395
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,300
translated here in German with a 
prepositional object. 

396
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,440
We could also say in older German 

397
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,200
, der Kaufmann erinnerte sich 

398
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,780
seiner Heimat, so also 

399
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,380
translate with a genitive . With Obliviski 
it is also the 

400
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,440

401
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,140
case that we have a different case 
reaction. 

402
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,300
In fact, there is no other way here. 

403
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,420
Magister Discipulorum eos Obliviski 

404
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,600
tur. The master forgets his 

405
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,580
disciples. Whom does the master forget 

406
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,880
his disciples? German with 

407
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,140
accusative in Latin with 

408
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,960
genitive object. In addition, there is 

409
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,820
also the applicative 

410
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,400
, and as we already know, it is 

411
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,960
usually 

412
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,760
found in the sentence as an applicative, 
i.e. as an adverbial, and 

413
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,960
only the applicativus separativus, we 

414
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,700
know that there are several 

415
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,040
forms of the applicative , only the 
applicativus 

416
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,020
separativus can also be used as a verb, 
can 

417
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,360
also 

418
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,720
be required as the object of a verb. There 
are some 

419
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,380
deponentia, i.e. deponentia are 

420
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,280
verbs with a passive stem such as 
obliviski, 

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,020
which 

422
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,080
are formed with an ablative object. The 
translation is of course 

423
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,280
also with a different case reaction, 

424
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
as we know that the ablative 

425
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720

426
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,400
does not exist as a case in German. We can 
see 

427
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,160
several examples here. I'll 

428
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720
pick out one here. 

429
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,620
Auxilio egeo. I need help. Who 

430
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,440
do I need help from? Is 

431
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,000
formed here with the applicative. Just 
like we 

432
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,520
have this example here, or 

433
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,240
let's take the first one in Antiqua Roma. 

434
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,140
Servi libertate caroerunt. In ancient 

435
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,380
Rome, slaves had no 

436
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,560
freedom. Who did the slaves 

437
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,600
not have ? Freedom. So who did the slaves 

438
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,920
not have freedom? We have that 

439
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,420
in Antika Roma, in ancient Rome. We have 
that 

440
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,920
here as an applativus loci, 

441
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,600
which means it is also in the 

442
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
applative . But here it is not an 

443
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,320
object, but an 

444
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,040
adverbial determination of time. We 

445
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,780
see more here. Imperator 

446
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,620
Castris Potiethor, the general will 

447
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,280
take control of the camp. 

448
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,940
Whom will he take control of? 

449
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,040
The camp. or if we 

450
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,140
have a double applicative, then 

451
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,680
the verb uti can be used to 

452
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,240
translate the whole thing as, as, that is, 
as. 

453
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,440
So Markus has a bear, Urso, 

454
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,460
Animali, Domestico as a pet. 

455
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,240
Now let's 

456
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,120
take a look at the subordinate clauses. I 

457
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,660
hope that this is clear so far. 

458
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,580
We hope we now want to 

459
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,240
talk about the subordinate clauses and 

460
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,120
start with the attribute. The attribute 

461
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,540
is first and foremost an 

462
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,020
addition and an attribute can 

463
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,700
be formed from several word types. 

464
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,560
It therefore 

465
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,080
adds further properties to other sentence 
elements. Further 

466
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,240
sentence elements or other sentence 
elements, 

467
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
by which I mean, of course, 

468
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,180
the main sentence elements. 

469
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,320
We 

470
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,540
usually concentrate on the nouns rather 

471
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,220
than the verbs, because for 

472
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,180
the verbs we have the adverbials 

473
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,000
, which we will come to in a moment. It 

474
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,840
therefore enriches a person, a thing 

475
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,160
or a circumstance with further 

476
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
information. Here we see the 

477
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,900
clear reference to nouns. It 

478
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,040
therefore fulfills the following criteria. 
The 

479
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,760
attribute rules 

480
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,380
in 

481
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,120
competition with the corresponding clause. 
This means that it 

482
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,140

483
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,800

484
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,260
takes on the case, the number and, if 
necessary, the gender of the corresponding 
clause. Let's look 

485
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,960
at the example here. There are different 

486
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,000
types of words that 

487
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,180
can form an attribute . There are 
adjectives, i.e. 

488
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,360
like-words or nouns themselves, 

489
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
which 

490
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
are not an object or subject. Pronouns or 
relative clauses, 

491
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,720
participles or sentential 

492
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
constructions. In other words, we 

493
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,860
learn that whole subordinate clauses can 

494
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,300
also 

495
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,400
be understood as attributes or number 
words 

496
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,220
or numerals. Let's start 

497
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,240
with the example on. Here we have 

498
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,900
Phamosus Medicus Poella Curat. Here we 
have 

499
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,460
a famous doctor, a 

500
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,720
girl. Here Phamosus becomes part of the 

501
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,180
subject. We then have Phamosus 

502
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,340
Medicus Filia Mercatoris Curat, a 

503
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,820
famous doctor, the 

504
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,840
merchant 's daughter. Here, a 

505
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,920
noun becomes part of the 

506
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,340
accusative object, 

507
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
which means we have a 

508
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,640
genitive attribute. Then we have a 

509
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,800
possessive pronoun, i.e. a 

510
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,480
pronoun that 

511
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,940
becomes part of the subject , or part of 
the 

512
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,300
object in this case. 

513
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
Medicus, suam, filiam, curate. Here we 

514
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,620
have Uam, so Filiam and Suam, 

515
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,180
which means Suam is the 

516
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,840
possessive pronoun that refers to 

517
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,560
doctor. but 

518
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,200
agrees with filiam , so we know 

519
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,220
who it refers to. Then we have 

520
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,760
a subordinate clause which refers to the 

521
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,620
poella, i.e. the accusative object 

522
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
, medicus poellam, coelector 

523
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,000
teneto, curat. The doctor is a 

524
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,300
girl who keeps the bed. So 

525
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
here the relative clause describes 

526
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,460
the object. Here we have a 

527
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,780
participle which is an attribute 

528
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,740
of Arminius. 

529
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,520
Here we have a participle and an 
applicative. 

530
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,180
We know this as a participle 

531
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,080
conjunctum or simply as a PPP. 

532
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,440
Arminius Iracaptus Romanus Petivit 

533
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,420
, Arminius, seized with rage, 

534
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,020
attacked the Romans . So here 

535
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,100
Iracaptus, i.e. this participle 

536
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,380
conjunctum, becomes part of the subject. 
Then 

537
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,600
we have Rex videt pontem deletus 

538
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,160
. Here the participle, i.e. 

539
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,520
the PPP with ACI, i.e. sentence-final 

540
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,400
construction, becomes part of the 

541
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,740
accusative object. The king sees 

542
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,660
that the bridge has been destroyed. 

543
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,080
We can check this by 

544
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,980
asking who 

545
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,220
or what the king sees , namely that the 

546
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,400
bridge has been destroyed. Then 

547
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,100
we have another number word, 

548
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,780
expressed here in the applicative, 

549
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,220
the oramedicus Romam it, which means 

550
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,220
the doctor goes home at the third hour 

551
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,360
. In other words, we 

552
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,860
have number words with a noun in the 

553
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,000
applicative. 

554
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,460
Unlike the attributive , the adverbial is 
a circumstantial word. 

555
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,300
This means that it is also 

556
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,040
formed from several word types and is made 

557
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,740
up of them. However, it is 

558
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,580
not part of another part of the sentence, 

559
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,460
but is a complete, 

560
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,720
independent clause in its own right. The 

561
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,620
adverbial is neither subject 

562
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,300
, object nor predicate. It 

563
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,860
therefore represents an additional 
circumstance. 

564
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,940
The adverbial 

565
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,820
is also directly related to the predicate, 

566
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,240
just like all other sentence elements, of 
course, and 

567
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,620
the adverbial comes from the 

568
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,060
adverbs. Here we also see the 

569
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,780
clear reference to the predicate, as 

570
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,120
adverbs, i.e. 

571
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,000
words belonging to the verb , usually 
describe the how of the 

572
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,220
predicate. This means that, in a 

573
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,680
broader sense, adverbials are also 

574
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,840
an extension of the predicate. 

575
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,520
However, adverbials are not 

576
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,100
necessary in the sentence, i.e. in 

577
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,380
our translation they should be 

578
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,240
translated last. 

579
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,820
Adverbials fulfill the following 

580
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,420
criteria: they are either in the 

581
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,120
applicative, which is the best known, 

582
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,320
in the accusative or in the dative. They 

583
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,540
can 

584
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,580
be introduced by a preposition or the 

585
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,060
adverbial can 

586
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,680
form an entire subordinate clause. 

587
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,440
Let's take a look at this. We can see the 

588
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,600
different forms of the applative here. 

589
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,820
Let's remember 

590
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,160
that the only way 

591
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,240
to form the applativus separativus is as 
an object. We 

592
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,380
can see that the adverbial 

593
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,980
is often found as an applicative in the 
sentence. 

594
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,920
Its name is used to define the question 
and 

595
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,420
intention of the sentence. This means that 

596
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,180
we have the individual 

597
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,420
descriptions of the time, the place, 

598
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,840
the means or even the reason 

599
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,560
or the manner. 

600
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,180
So we have different questions that we 

601
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,840
can ask and we want to look at 

602
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,900

603
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,420
how we can 

604
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,040
enrich the sentence with the help of 
adverbials in this example sentence 

605
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,180
, but realize that these 

606
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,700
circumstantial words are not necessary. 

607
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,600
In other words, they can also 

608
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,480
be omitted. 

609
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,280
read the sentence once. Tertia hora in 
foro romano, 

610
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,160
locius cum amicus suo, katana viens 

611
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,220
cum gaudio, alies mercatoris salutat. 

612
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
We translate. At the third hour, 

613
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,180
he and his friend from 

614
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,600
Katana com locius greet 

615
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,440
the other merchants in the Roman Forum 
with 

616
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
great joy. So let' 

617
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,500
s reduce the sentence to the 

618
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,200
necessary sentence elements, that is, 

619
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,640
to the main sentence elements, 

620
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,540
i.e. we are looking for the predicate, 
subject and object. 

621
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,280
We find that Salutat, third 

622
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,020
person singular, is followed by 

623
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,080
Locius, which is in the nominative 
singular 

624
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,380
. This means that we have 

625
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,980
found our predicate and our subject 

626
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,840
and have Salutat 

627
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,120
someone great here. So we are looking for 

628
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,880
an accusative and have 

629
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,000
found the form mercatoris here 

630
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,260
and also have aliis here. That means 

631
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,140
an attribute, that is an 

632
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,620
additional how-word, that is how, 

633
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,300
yes, and that is the other merchants, 

634
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,740
that is another how-word, that is 

635
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,960
an enriching word, so an 

636
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,560
additional addition and we 

637
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,920
translate, Lokius greets the 

638
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,200
other merchants. Now we enrich 

639
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,380
the circumstances and add a time 

640
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,820
, at the third hour, then a 

641
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,320
place on the Forum Romanum. Then 

642
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,420
we can add cum gaudio, cum amico 

643
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,620
suum, that is, with his friend, 

644
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,780
which means we have an 

645
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,240
ablativus sociativus here. Then we have 

646
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,420
a separativus, katana viens, 

647
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,740
so we establish, here 

648
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,060
again, a predicate in the form of an 

649
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,200
ablativus separativus, that is, 

650
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,880
from where. Cum gaudio, then in what 

651
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,000
way? That is, cum gaudio in the sense 

652
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,720
of modal, how or in what way 

653
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,000
does he greet her? In other words, we 

654
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,940
realize that we can 

655
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,800
then gradually 

656
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,840
add the individual circumstantial words in 
our translation 

657
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,800
and thus 

658
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,020
construct a good sentence. Let us now turn 
to the 

659
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,680
predicative of the special 

660
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,900
adverbial. A predicative is a 

661
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,460
special adverbial because it is a 

662
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,080
dependent adverbial. We have 

663
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,580
just learned that they are independent, 

664
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,900
i.e. they form their own 

665
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,460
sentence elements. The adverbial, the 

666
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,760
predicative, is not, because it depends on 

667
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,980
someone. It describes 

668
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,840
an equivalent addition with 

669
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,920
another nominative. In other words, it 

670
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,580
depends on the subject. The 

671
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,620
predicative therefore fulfills the 
following 

672
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,960
criteria. The predicative 

673
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,600
is another noun in the nominative case. 

674
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,700

675
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,540

676
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,680
It is formed from a noun or an adjective 
in competition with the subject , i.e. it 

677
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,640
agrees with it in casus numerus and genus. 
The suffix, 

678
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,280
i.e. the predicative, is 

679
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,840
translated as als. We see this here as an 

680
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,060
example, gladiatoris in Arema primi 

681
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,300
intrand. The gladiators 

682
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,980
are the first to enter the arena. Caesar 
dictator 

683
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,060
mortus est. Caesar died as dictator 

684
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,560
. We note that both 

685
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,600
times, here as an adjective and here as a 

686
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,300
noun, it competes 

687
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,340
with our subject and is 

688
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,980
translated as als. So today we have 

689
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,740
learned about the main clause kria. 

690
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,420
We have learned that they 

691
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,160
follow a certain order. 

692
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,780
We realized that we should first 

693
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,100

694
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,140
translate the predicate, then the subject, 
then the object if necessary. 

695
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,020
We learned how the sentence clauses 

696
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,640
relate to each other. We 

697
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,080
have established 

698
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,860
that the predicate already 

699
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,400
contains a subject , which we 

700
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,880

701
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,600
can infer from the personal ending. We can 

702
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
infer the subject by 

703
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,460
looking at which number the 

704
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,960
predicate is in and we can 

705
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,220
infer the object by 

706
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,900
asking ourselves with which object and 
whether it 

707
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,260
governs with an object at all. 

708
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,200
We have clarified this under the 

709
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,740
technical term transitivity. 

710
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,240
We then 

711
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,540
looked at how attributes are 

712
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,640
added to other sentence elements. In other 
words, 

713
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
they either become part of a 

714
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,640
subject or an object. 

715
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,040
There are different 

716
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,840
types of words that 

717
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,820
can form an attribute. We then 

718
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,980
saw that 

719
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,860
adverbials are circumstantial words that 

720
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,060

721
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,260
construct independent sentence elements 
and that the 

722
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,600
predicative is a special feature 

723
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,700
because it combines adverbials and 

724
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,360
a dependency. In other words, it is 

725
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,680
a mixture of attribute and 

726
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,440
adverbial. It is usually in KNG 

727
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,640
 congruence with the subject and is then 

728
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,900
translated as an addition with als. 

729
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,280
Thank you for your attention.
