00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,900
Hello, my name is Paula and I 

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,160
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,660
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,800
something about the different 

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,020
classes of 

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,380
hydrocarbon compounds. 

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,160
In our online learning center you will 

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,760
of course also find a 

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,600
wiki on this topic , in which the 

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,180
basic and important terms 

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,240
are explained in more detail. We are all 

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,500
familiar with 

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,600
words that sound similar but have 
completely 

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,980
different meanings. 

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,860
For example, model and model or circle 

16
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,640
and old man. The equivalents in chemistry 

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,420
would be ethane, ethene and 

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,440
ethyne , for example. All three are 

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,000
hydrocarbons with similar 

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,280
names and molecular formulas 

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,780
, but with 

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,280
different properties. 

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,660

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,880
However, the naming, i.e. ending in an, en 
or in, follows a fixed 

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,400
principle, which 

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,140
fortunately 

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,440
simplifies the whole thing somewhat. 
However, before I go into this 

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,240
in more detail, I would like to 

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,560

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,600
go through the basics with you. Firstly 

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
, hydrocarbons are organic 

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,340
substances that are made up exclusively of 
C 

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,420
 and H atoms. Secondly 

34
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,780
, they have the general 

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,420
molecular formula CMH0. Thirdly 

36
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,960
, there are different categories of 

37
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,140
hydrocarbons. Now to the 

38
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,060
categories. Firstly, a distinction is made 

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,660
between aliphatic and 

40
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,540
aromatic hydrocarbons. 

41
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,700
Aromatic hydrocarbons 

42
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,380
are characterized by the fact that they 

43
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,140
have at least one specific ring structure. 

44
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,840
This in turn is characterized by the fact 

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,220
that it is no longer possible to 

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,080
determine exactly where the single 

47
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,340
and where the double bonds are 

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,040
located, which is why they are 

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,580

50
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,160
referred to as delocalized double bonds. 
This is shown in the 

51
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,380
structural formula as an inner ring 

52
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,440
within C66. 

53
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,400

54
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
However, we will not go into this category 
in detail in this video. In the case of 

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,720
aliphatic hydrocarbons 

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,320
, a further 

57
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,200

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,000
distinction is made between saturated and 
unsaturated compounds . 

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Chains or 

60
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,740
rings can occur in both subcategories . 
Saturated 

61
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,560
hydrocarbons are called alkanes. 

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,420
They are characterized by the fact that 

63
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,580
each C atom within the molecule 

64
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,400

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,660
forms bonds with four other atoms . Here 
is 

66
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,500
a table of the first four alkanes to 
illustrate this. 

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Generally speaking, the 

68
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,040
names end in an and the general 

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,120
molecular formula is cnH2n plus 2. Those 

70
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,160
were the saturated 

71
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,260
hydrocarbons. Now we come 

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,220
to the unsaturated 

73
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,440
hydrocarbons, alkenes and 

74
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,220
alkynes. Alkenes have C 

75
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,800
 double bonds. Accordingly, 

76
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,860
the first alkene already consists of 

77
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,220
two C atoms. It is called ethene. An 

78
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,740
alkene with three C atoms is called 
propene. 

79
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,000
So far so good. From four C atoms upwards 

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
, however, things get a little 

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,100
more complicated. If the 

82
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,320
double bond is between the first and 

83
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,560
second C atoms, it is called a butene. 

84
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,460
In this case, the molecule can only 

85
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,940
be constructed in one way. 

86
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,080
However, if the double bond is located 

87
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,000
between the second and third C 

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,940
 atoms, two different 

89
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,560
molecular forms are possible. The 
so-called 

90
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,940
cis-form, in which the 

91
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,100
methyl groups are on the same side 

92
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,420
, and the transform, in which 

93
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,860
the methyl groups are on 

94
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,180
different sides. 

95
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,820
In general, alkenes have one C 

96
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,980
 double bond. However, if 

97
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,060
there are several double bonds, they are 
referred 

98
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,860
to as polyenes. The names of 

99
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,480
unsaturated hydrocarbons 

100
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,100
therefore all end in "-en". The 

101
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,620
general molecular formula is CnH2n. 

102
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,060

103
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,920
There is no general structural formula. 
Alkynes have C 

104
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,980
 triple bonds. The shortest 

105
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,260
alkyne is ethyne. It is followed by 
propyne 

106
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,860
and a butyne. In general, alkynes 

107
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,260
have one C triple bond; if 

108
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,960
there are several triple bonds, they 

109
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,620
are referred to as polyynes. The names 

110
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,980
end in "-in". The general 

111
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,720
molecular formula is "-cnH2n-2". 

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,820

113
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,320
There is no general structural formula 
here either. Let us 

114
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
briefly summarize once again . There 

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,020
are aromatic and aliphatic 

116
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,340
hydrocarbons. In the case of 

117
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,120
aliphatic hydrocarbons , 

118
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
a distinction is made 

119
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,980
between saturated and unsaturated 

120
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,200
compounds. Saturated 

121
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,680
hydrocarbons are alkanes. Their 

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,660
names end in an. The general 

123
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,300
molecular formula is cnH2n plus 2. 

124
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,060
Unsaturated hydrocarbons 

125
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,660
include alkenes. The names 

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,620
of alkenes always end in en. They 

127
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,620
have C double bonds and if 

128
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,620
only one is present, the 

129
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,140
general molecular formula is cnH2n. 

130
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,180
There are also alkynes. The 

131
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,000
names of alkynes always end 

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
 in "-in". They have C 

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,320
 triple bonds and if only one is present 

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,220
, 

135
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,180
the general molecular formula is CnH2n-2. 
I hope that 

136
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,860
you now have a better understanding of 

137
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,320
the different classes of 

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,060
hydrocarbon compounds. 

139
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,240

this or
