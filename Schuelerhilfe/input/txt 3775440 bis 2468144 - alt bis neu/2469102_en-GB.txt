00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,750
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,850
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,870
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,650
explain something about strength. 

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,370
In our online learning center, you can 

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,830
of course also 

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,490
find a wiki on this topic, 

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,810

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,310
which explains the basic and important 
terms in more detail. 

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,770
You may already be familiar with starch 

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,830
from recipes or ingredient lists on 

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,070
packaging. It is 

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,650
a fine, colorless and odorless 

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,110
powder that is a 

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,990
long-chain carbohydrate 

16
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,530
, a so-called polysaccharide, with 

17
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,490
the general formula C6H10O5. Starch 

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,690
is one of the most important 

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,090
storage substances in plant 

20
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,470
cells. They consist of many 

21
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,870
 alpha-glucose units, which 

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,670

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,450
are linked together via so-called 
alpha-glucosidic bonds. 

24
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,990
Alpha-glucose 

25
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,170
is the molecule in which the 

26
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,410
hydroxyl group on C1 

27
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,050
points downwards in the Howarth 
projection. The 

28
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,670
glucose molecules are 

29
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,450

30
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,930
linked together by condensation reactions. 
This condensation 

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,810
takes place by splitting off water. 

32
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,890
The reverse reaction, i.e. the breakdown 

33
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,290
of starch to glucose 

34
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,710
, takes place using water and is called 

35
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,490
hydrolysis or hydrolytic 

36
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,810
cleavage. In unbranched 

37
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,090
starch molecules, only C1 

38
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,950
and C4 are 

39
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,830
involved in the bonds. The bond is 

40
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,990
 called alpha-1,4 -glycosidic. If 

41
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,030
branched starch is present, 

42
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,410
the C6 atom is also 

43
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,230
involved in the bond at the branching 
points . 

44
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,490
There is also an alpha-1,6 

45
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,970
-glycosidic bond. 

46
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,230
Accordingly, a distinction is made between 
two 

47
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,370
forms of starch. Amylose consists of 
approx. 

48
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,430
500 to 6000 glycose units, which 

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,090

50
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,390
are only linked alpha-1,4-glycosidically . 
This results in a 

51
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,630
linear helical 

52
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,930
chain. A helix 

53
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,110
, also 

54
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,270
known as a helix or cylindrical spiral, is 
a curve that 

55
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,050

56
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,230
winds around a cylinder with a constant 
pitch. Due to the 

57
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,170
bond angle at the oxygen, 

58
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,590
not all glycosemonomers lie in a 

59
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,230
straight line, but the chain has 

60
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,910
a curvature and a slight 

61
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,350
torsion, i.e. twist. This leads to 

62
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,210
the helix-like 

63
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,450
structure already mentioned. The 

64
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,730
hydrophilic hydroxyl groups of the helix 

65
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,550
point outwards, which means that 

66
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,650
this starch 

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,190
is soluble in water. Amylopectin, on the 
other hand, which 

68
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,150
consists of hundreds of thousands to 
millions of 

69
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,230
glucose building blocks, is 

70
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,790
insoluble in water but swells in 

71
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,570
water. Amylopectin is the 

72
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,670
so-called branched starch, in which 

73
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,590
the C6 atom is also 

74
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,110
involved in the bond. There are also 

75
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,370
alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds 

76
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,990
. Vegetable 

77
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,610
starch usually consists of 20-30% amyllose 
and 70-80% 

78
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,310
amylopectin. Starch 

79
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,590
can be detected with the iodine test. 

80
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,650
An iodine-containing solution is used for 
this, 

81
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,470
usually an iodine-potassium iodide 
solution 

82
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,130
or a so-called iodine tincture, i.e. 

83
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,650
an alcoholic solution of 

84
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,750
elemental iodine, which 

85
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,050

86
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,530
is added to the starch-containing solution 
or sample. The iodine sample 

87
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,110
produces a blue-violet to 

88
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,650
black coloration due to an 

89
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,510
inclusion compound. The 

90
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,390
amylose present in starch 

91
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,270
has a helical conformation with a 

92
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,290
channel-like cavity in the middle. 

93
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,430

94
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,890
Polyodide chains can become embedded in 
these cavities . This 

95
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,190
intercalation leads to a 

96
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,430
delocalization of valence electrons 

97
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,310
and thus to absorption in higher 

98
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,590
wavelength ranges. The solution 

99
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,030
appears blue. Plants use 

100
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,970
starch to store excess 

101
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,990
energy. For this purpose, the 

102
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,410
glucose monomers are linked together to 
form starch 

103
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,390
in order to 

104
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,750
bind glucose in an insoluble and 
osmotically ineffective form. 

105
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,810
Seeds, 

106
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,810
tubers and onions are rich in starch 
granules . 

107
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,430

108
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,930
We use the processing of these tubers to 
produce starch. 

109
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,690
The majority of global production comes 

110
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,570
from maize. Around 5% comes from 

111
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,010
potatoes. Starch can be 

112
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,930
broken down by enzymes known as amylases 

113
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,050
. In addition to 

114
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,950
disaccharides , this also produces 
dextrins 

115
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,250
, which are poly- and 

116
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,830
oligosaccharides. 

117
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,730
When exposed to heat, starch can 

118
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,770
bind, swell 

119
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,050
and gelatinize a large amount of water. 
These properties 

120
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,630
make starch useful for all 

121
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,630
kinds of baked goods and dishes. In 
addition to 

122
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,990
its use in 

123
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,810
food production , starch is also used for 

124
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,970
sizing paper, mordanting 

125
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,450
cotton and dyeing. 

126
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,990
So in addition to its nutritional value, 
it 

127
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,050
can also be used in many other ways. 

128
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,830
I hope that you now know more about 

129
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,750
starch. If you have any further questions 
on 

130
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,390
these or other topics,

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,190
