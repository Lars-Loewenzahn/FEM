00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,160
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,440
Growth and Decay Processes webinar . 

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,920
In this webinar we will deal with 

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,580
growth and decay processes 

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,580
. First, we will take a look at 

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,520
the growth function n of t 

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,000
. Then we will look at a 

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,460
small example task on 

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,940
bacterial culture. This is an 

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,840
example of exponential 

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
growth. We will then move on to 

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,060
exponential decay. 

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,060
In other words, we look 

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,280
at exponential decay 

15
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,900
using the example of a radioactive 

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,240
decay generator of limited 

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,380
decay. We will also do this using 

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,820
an example. The example 

19
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,700
is thermal cooling. And 

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,800
finally, we'll take a look at 

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,520
geologistic growth, using 

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,160

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,010
the rumor mill as an example. We will now 
start 

24
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,430
with the growth function N of T. 

25
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,250
In the case of exponential 

26
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,910
growth, the following approach is taken 

27
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,850
. The growth rate is 

28
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,430
proportional to the stock. This is 

29
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,910
always the case with growth functions. 

30
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,190
This means that if the stock is twice as 

31
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,370
large, growth is also 

32
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,610
twice as large. This is also related to 

33
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,550
this growth factor, i.e. 

34
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,510
if the population is twice as large, 

35
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,770
growth 

36
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,770
is inevitably twice as large. 

37
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,510
Classic examples of this are 

38
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,250
bacterial cultures, for example, which 

39
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,070
always double in size. Or when 

40
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,050
it comes to decay, atomic 

41
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,550
decay. If there is more, 

42
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,090
it decays faster than if 

43
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,930
there is less. And based on 

44
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,270
this knowledge, we now derive 

45
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,070
our... growth function n 

46
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,910
from t. Based on the 

47
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,390
proportionality factor, we can 

48
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,510
say that k times n of t is equal to n' 

49
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,010
of t. So n of t is the stock, 

50
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,210
n' of t is the rate of change 

51
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,610
or growth, and 

52
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,710
we've just said that this 

53
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,770
is proportional. And we 

54
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,850
now rewrite the differential n' of t to 

55
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,930
dn by dt and 

56
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,850
rearrange the whole thing so that the dt 

57
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,270
is on the left-hand side and the n of t is 
down here in the 

58
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,850
denominator and thus arrive at k times dt 

59
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,990
equals 1 by n of t dn. We 

60
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,790
now want to integrate this equation. 

61
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,630
We integrate in the limits 0 to 

62
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,770
t or 0 to n. This gives us the 

63
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,070
integral 0 to t of k dt is equal 

64
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,210
to 0 to n of 1 by n of t dn. The 

65
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,450
integral 0 to t of k times dt is 

66
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,990
simply solved by k times t, i.e. 

67
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,010
kt. And the integral 0 to n of 1 

68
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,430
by n of t is solved by the 

69
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,270
logarithm of n of t. 

70
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,530
Of course, we ultimately want n of t to 

71
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,910
stand alone on one side. 

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,750
Therefore, we now go and 

73
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,210
exponentiate with the E-combination. 

74
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,530
function. This means we have e to the 
power of 

75
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,750
k times t is equal to n of t. 

76
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,270
By exponentiating with the e-function 

77
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,150
, we solve the logarithm. That is the 

78
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,390
approach. In addition to this approach, 
there is 

79
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,730
of course the boundary condition 

80
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,130
that n of 0 is equal to n 0 and so 

81
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,630
the general 

82
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,570
functional equation of a 

83
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,350
growth function is n of t is equal to 

84
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,510
n 0 times e to the power of k t. As 

85
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,590
already mentioned , n 0 is our initial 
value and k is our 

86
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,250
growth value. The function factor t is 

87
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,390
the variable, i.e. the time as a 

88
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,250
rule. And that's where we 

89
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,450
start . We have a 

90
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,710
small example task. A 

91
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,210
bacterial culture 

92
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,190
consists of 600 units at the start of the 
measurement. After 4 

93
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,150
hours, 3256 units have already been 

94
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,190
counted. The first thing we have to do is 

95
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,750
set up the functional equation. 

96
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,690

97
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,510
Once we have established the functional 
equation, we have to 

98
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,650

99
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,950
determine the population after 3, 5 and 10 
hours. Finally, we have to 

100
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,570
specify the doubling time. 

101
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,310
In other words, as 

102
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,910
specified in the task , we start by 

103
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,590
determining the functional equations 

104
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,090
. Such information, where a stock 

105
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,410
at the start of the measurement or a stock 
at 

106
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,510
time 0 is given, is very 

107
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,730
valuable, because you should always 

108
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,290
start with this. Yes, that's why we start 

109
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,910
with 600 is equal to N0 times E to the 
power of K 

110
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,870
times 0. The advantage here is that we 

111
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,470
have e to the power of k times 0 is e to 
the power of 0 and 

112
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,070
something to the power of 0 is always 1. 
This means that 

113
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,510
it says 600 is equal to 

114
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,450
n0 times 1 and therefore we 

115
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,810
immediately know n0 is equal to 600. And 

116
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,010
we can then 

117
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,030
use the second condition directly. After 4 
hours 

118
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,930
, 3256 units are already 

119
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,150
counted, which means 3200... 3256 is 

120
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,310
equal to N0 times E to the power of K 
times 4. 4 

121
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,550
here because it 

122
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,110
is after 4 hours. We know the N0. That's 

123
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,550
the 600 from before. We 

124
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,830
therefore use it directly and arrive at 

125
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,460
this equation. We can now see 

126
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,820
directly that we only have our K 

127
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,480
as an unknown. So we 

128
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,580
simply change to this one. First, 

129
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,200
of course, we try to 

130
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,640
isolate our power. That means we divide 

131
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,120
by 600. 3,256 divided by 600 

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,900
is then 5.427 and that is then 

133
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,880
equal to e to the power of k times 4. We 
realize 

134
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,040
that we cannot 

135
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,580
summarize or simplify it any further 

136
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,720
, so the e-function must now 

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,140
give way. We do this with the ln 

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,340
, so whenever you 

139
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,800
have an e-function or e as the base, take 
the ln, 

140
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,580
the logarithm of Naturale, 

141
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,960
because this also has the base E and 
therefore 

142
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,240
we can now 

143
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
take the logarithm directly from the 5.427 
. That is 1.7 

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,440
approximately and on the right-hand side 

145
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,920
we get none, because the ln of 

146
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,800
E is 1. That is why there is 

147
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,180
only 4 times k on the right-hand side. To 

148
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,260
determine k now , we just have to 

149
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,740
divide by 4, then it says k is 

150
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,760
equal to 0.42. And 

151
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,200
now we have our growth. 

152
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,120
power function completely 

153
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,430
. Next, we should 

154
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,530
determine the stock after 3, 5 and 10 
hours 

155
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,390
. To do this, we simply 

156
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,970
enter 3, 5 and 10 for our variable. 

157
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,890
This means that we now know that after 3 

158
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,310
hours there were 2115 units, after 

159
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,030
5 hours there were 4899 and after 10 hours 

160
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,310
there were 40,011 

161
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,490
units. 

162
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,090
Finally, we should 

163
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,350
calculate the doubling time. The 

164
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,710
doubling time is exactly the time 

165
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,330
it takes for the stock to 

166
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,730
double. In other words, when 

167
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,470
the number of units 

168
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,910
has doubled since the start of 
measurement. 

169
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,290
In other words, we had 600 

170
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,790
units at the beginning , so we need to 
know after 

171
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,510
how many hours there were 1200 

172
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,570
units. Therefore, we 

173
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,510

174
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,730
equate our already determined functional 
equation with 1200 and solve the 

175
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,590
resulting equation. So 1200 is 

176
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:23,010
equal to 600 times e to the power of 
0.42t. Same 

177
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,690
technique here, first 

178
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,930
divide by 600 to 

179
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,930
isolate our power. Then it says 2 equals 

180
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,410
e to the power of 0.42t. Now we 

181
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,550
apply a logarithm here , also 

182
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,170
logarithm naturales, i.e. ln, because 

183
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,050
we have an e-function here. Then 

184
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,250
it says that the ln of 2 is equal to 0 

185
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,830
.42 times t. Now we just have to 

186
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,070
divide by 0.42. And then it says 

187
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,630
the ln of 2 divided by 0.42 is 

188
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,230
equal to t, so in our case 1.65. 

189
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,450
This means that after 1.65 hours the 

190
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,790
stock has doubled. In other 

191
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,470
words, 

192
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,050
the stock doubles every 1.65 hours. 

193
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,400
Here we see the general formula 

194
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,460
for determining the doubling time. 

195
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,240
It is always the ln of 2 divided 

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,660
by k. As I said, the k is 

197
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,140

198
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,700
always the factor for our variables here . 
and with this formula 

199
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,880
we can always 

200
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,700

201
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,340
determine the doubling time straight away 
without this calculation here. As I said, 
this can 

202
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,140
be used. With the calculation here, 

203
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,840
however, you do exactly what 

204
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,860
is actually written down here. This 

205
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,040
also brings us to the opposite 

206
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,020
. This is the 

207
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
exponential decrease. We 

208
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,300
have just had exponential 

209
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,700
growth here. The bacteria have 

210
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,520
multiplied. Now we have the 

211
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,180
opposite example: an exponential 

212
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,200
decrease . The classic example 

213
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,080
of an exponential decrease is always 

214
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,800
a radioactive decay and the fact that it 

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
is a decrease is immediately 

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,940
clear from the fact that 

217
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,200
the exponent is negative 

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,160
. Therefore, the approach is 

219
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,420
always N0 times e to the power of minus k 
times 

220
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,330
t. 

221
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,310
This is also called the half-life . The 
half-life is the 

222
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,050
point in time when only half 

223
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,090
of the initial value is still present. 

224
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,890
There is also a ready-made 

225
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,550
formula for this , which we will now 

226
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,250
derive. As just mentioned, the 

227
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,150
half-life is the stock that 

228
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,230

229
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,730
corresponds to only half of the original 
stock, 

230
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,910
i.e. N0 half. And to 

231
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,530
calculate the time, we 

232
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,870
also equate our functional equation 

233
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,310
with this stock. So 

234
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,150
we arrive at this nice equation 

235
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,530
here. N0 half is equal to N0 times e 

236
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,870
to the power of minus kt. First, we divide 

237
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,450
by N0. N0 half divided by N0 

238
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,690
is 1 half or 0.5. And that's 

239
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,910
equal to E raised minus K times T. Again 

240
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,450
, we apply the logarithm. 

241
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,910
This is how we arrive at the logarithm. 

242
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,870
So here again, the logarithm 

243
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,830
natural Ln of 1 half is equal to 

244
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,150
minus K times T. We now just divide 

245
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,150
by minus K. And then 

246
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,530
the Ln of 1 half by minus K is 

247
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,570
equal to T one half. This C½ here 

248
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,470
with the subscript C½ is simply the 

249
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,470
sign for the half-life. 

250
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,450
In other words, we can use this formula to 

251
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,890
determine the half-life. 

252
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,560
Here we already have 

253
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,660
our example. A 

254
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,440
radioactive element has a 

255
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
half-life of 653 days. After 

256
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,680
four years, around 1000 grams of the 

257
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,900
initial quantity have not decayed. That 

258
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,040
means it is the stock. How large 

259
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,960
was the initial quantity? What 

260
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,360
is common here is that 

261
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,920
the time is sometimes given in years and 

262
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,820
sometimes in days. 

263
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,340
Of course, you have to agree on a unit 

264
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,080
. We have now agreed on 

265
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,380
days. That means we know that 

266
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,340
after four years, i.e. four times 365 

267
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,380
days, 

268
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,700
there will only be 1000 grams left. And we 
know that the 

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,300
half-life is 653 days. This 

270
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,440
means that N0 half. is equal to N0 times E 

271
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,700
to the power of minus K times 653. These 
are the 

272
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,200
two equations we 

273
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,300
start with. The nice thing about the 

274
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,740
half-life here is that we can 

275
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,660
now divide it by N0, then 

276
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,600
it drops out and we only have 

277
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,780
our growth factor K, in this 

278
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,920
case decay factor K, as 

279
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,740
an unknown. In other words, 

280
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,340
we convert to this and determine it in 
this way. 

281
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,200
So the first step is divided 

282
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
by N0. Now it says 1.5 equals e 

283
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,840
to the power of minus k times 653, from 
which 

284
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,440
we form the logarithm. Now 

285
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,160
the logarithm of 1.5 equals minus 

286
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,740
k times 653. Now we divide 

287
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,260
by minus 653 simply because 

288
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,480
we want the k to 

289
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,620
stand alone. That's why the 

290
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,980
sign must be removed immediately. And 
that's why 

291
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,560
we divide by the 

292
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,860
sign and the 653. We 

293
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,400
then arrive at a K of 0.001061 

294
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,980
. Please 

295
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,300
always take enough 

296
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,000
decimal places with such small numbers . 
Two 

297
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,240
decimal places would be 

298
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
useless here , because that would be 

299
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,060
0 and the task would be invalid 

300
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,400
. OK, so that's our K 

301
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
now and we can now insert it 

302
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,220
into our function equation 

303
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,440
. We have 

304
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,620
done the same here and we now know that 

305
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,580
after 4 years or 1460 days, 

306
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,120
there will only be 1000 grams left. 

307
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,100
That means 1000 is equal to N0 times E to 
the power of 

308
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,240
minus 0.001061 times 1460. The nice thing 

309
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,300
is that here, I can 

310
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,100
't calculate the calculator, this 

311
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,480
is a number. We have to 

312
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,980
enter the calculator, the result is 0 

313
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,320
.212. That means 

314
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,400
we get  this equation and it looks 

315
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
much nicer. 1000 is 

316
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,680
equal to N0 times 0.212. Now we 

317
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
just divide by 0.212 and 

318
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
it says N0 is equal to 4710.33. This means 
that 

319
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,260
our answer is that 

320
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,180
4.7103 kg of the material was 

321
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,300
present at the start of the measurement. 
This also solves the problem 

322
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,610
. Now we come to the 

323
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,050
limited growth or limited 

324
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,250
decrease. The approach for this is N of T 

325
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,050
is equal to E plus or minus. Whether we 

326
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,050
have a plus or minus 

327
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,550
depends on whether we 

328
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,290

329
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,270
have a limited decrease or a limited 
increase. We have a plus for 

330
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,570
a limited decrease and a 

331
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,430
minus for a limited increase. 

332
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,570
So E plus minus A times E to the power of 
minus 

333
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,390
KT. It is important to know that E 

334
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,890
is the upper or lower limit, 

335
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,450
depending on what you have. And E plus 

336
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,090
or minus A is the starting value. This 

337
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,230
is very important, because 

338
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,510
we now need it for our task. 

339
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,390
Namely, a warm drink cools down in 

340
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,430
a container. The 

341
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,590
ambient temperature is 21 degrees 

342
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,010
Celsius. The drink is initially 60 

343
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,570
degrees Celsius. After 5 minutes, 

344
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,710
the temperature is only 55 

345
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,570
degrees Celsius. First of all, we 

346
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,090
should always use the boundary conditions. 

347
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,750
This means an ambient temperature of 21 

348
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,090
degrees and an initial temperature of 60 
degrees. 

349
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,510
The drink can of course only 

350
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,290
cool down to the ambient temperature, 

351
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,070
i.e. 21 degrees. That is our 

352
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,450
final temperature and therefore our E. E 

353
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,390
equals 21 degrees. And we know that 

354
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,210
the drink is 60 degrees 

355
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,330
at the start. That means E plus A equals 

356
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,990
60. We already know E and so 

357
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,790
we come up with this little 

358
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,670
equation. 21 plus A equals 60 

359
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,230
and then we know that A equals 20. 

360
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,310
39. We have thus 

361
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,390
determined two of our three variables. 

362
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,490
Our E and our A. What is still missing 

363
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,830
is our K. We can determine this using 

364
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,530
the last condition. We 

365
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,890
know that after five minutes 

366
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,970
the temperature will only be 55 

367
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,590
degrees Celsius. And that' 

368
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,290
s what we' re going to do now. So that's 

369
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,530
our current approach. And now we use 

370
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,210
the third condition and there 

371
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,370
we come across an equation 

372
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,970
we can 't get around, so 55 is 

373
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,090
equal to 21 plus 39 times e to the power 
of minus k 

374
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,630
times 5, so the 55 for 55 degrees and the 

375
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,150
54 because the temperature 

376
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,550
is 55 degrees after five minutes 

377
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,450

378
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,950
. 

379
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,570
In other words, if you 

380
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,070
want to get rid of the 21 here , you 
calculate minus 21. 55 minus 

381
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,330
21 is 34. Then it says 34 is 

382
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,170
equal to 39 times e raised minus k times 
5. 

383
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,170
Next, we try to 

384
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,270
isolate the power again. In other words, 
we 

385
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,330
divide by 39. Then we get 34 

386
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,170
divided by 39 equals e raised to the power 
of minus k 

387
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,110
times 5. This 

388
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,690
now goes back to the logarithm. 

389
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,150
Then we get the logarithm of 

390
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,350
34.39 is equal to minus k times 5. 

391
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,710
Therefore, we divide by minus 5 and 

392
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,130
arrive at a k of 0.027. 

393
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
We have 

394
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,460
already 

395
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,220
determined our functional equation . The 
temperature 

396
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,100
as a function of side t is equal to 

397
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,580
21 plus 39 times e to the power of minus 
0.027 T. 

398
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,700
The next question is, when is the 

399
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,160
drink only 20% warmer than the 

400
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,940
ambient temperature? First, 

401
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
of course, we have to determine the 

402
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,400
temperature we are looking for. 20% warmer 

403
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,640
than the ambient temperature is 21 times 

404
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,180
1.2, i.e. 25.2 degrees. Next, 

405
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,860
we equate our functional equation 

406
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,480
with the temperature. So 25.2 

407
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,040
is equal to 21 plus 39 times e to the 
power of 

408
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:10,060
minus 0.027t. The time t is 

409
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,140
of course wanted and therefore 

410
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,600
unknown. Consequently, we try to 

411
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,680
rearrange the equation according to t. We 

412
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,700
start by 

413
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,040
dragging the 21 back over with a minus. 
This gives us 

414
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,840
4.2, which is equal to 39 times e raised 
to the power of minus 0 

415
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,620
.027t. Next, we divide 

416
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,340
by 39  again to 

417
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,760
isolate our potential. Then we arrive at 
4.29 

418
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,740
equals e to the power minus 0.027t. 

419
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,580
Next again, our variable is 

420
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,540
once again in the exponent, so 

421
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,740
we need the logarithm again. 

422
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,280
Here we have an e-function 

423
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
, so we take the 

424
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,000
logarithm of Naturales again and then 

425
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,920
the ln of 4.2 divided by 39 is equal to 

426
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,400
minus 0.027 times t. We just divide it 

427
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,860
by minus 0.027 and then 

428
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,600
we get T is equal to 8.25. This 

429
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,040
means we can say that after 8.25 

430
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,480
minutes or 8 minutes and 15 

431
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,380
seconds, the temperature is only 

432
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,900
20% above the 

433
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,800
ambient temperature. 

434
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,440
And that brings us to 

435
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,180
our last type of growth, which is 

436
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,100
logistic growth. 

437
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,640
Logistic growth is always 

438
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,320
used when growth 

439
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,180
begins exponentially and 

440
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,080
ends in a limited way. 

441
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,660
The growth factor therefore 

442
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,480
not only describes the constant form of 

443
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,260
decrease and increase, but also 

444
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,920
changes as the value 

445
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,440
of n increases . In other words, our 

446
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,360
growth factor, as we can see here, 

447
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,660
n' of t is not constant, but 

448
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,460
k-dn times n and that is the big 

449
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,840
difference between the normal 

450
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,960
growth we had earlier. And 

451
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
that's why we now have a 

452
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,900
growth function that 

453
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,620
is a little more complex. N of T is equal 
to N0 

454
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,120
times E to the power of KT by 1 minus D by 
K 

455
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,760
times N0 times E to the power of KT minus 
1. It is important to 

456
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,140
note that K is still our 

457
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,160
growth coefficient and D is our 

458
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,900
depression coefficient. The 

459
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,280
final stock that results is D 

460
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,100
divided by K. This is a very important 

461
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,180
relationship that we need in order to 

462
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,380
include the functional equation. 

463
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,560
Because, of course, we have a small 

464
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:30,980
example. 

465
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,820
Student spreads the rumor, this 

466
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,200
student is 0.001 of the student body, 

467
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,180
i.e. 0.1% of the student body. And the 

468
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,560
7 students who know at 8 o'clock, 

469
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,700
excuse me, one hour 

470
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,460
later, are 

471
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,880
accordingly 0.007, i.e. 0.7%. 

472
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,680
It follows, of course, that 

473
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,340
if all pupils know 

474
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,000
, that is 1, so D divided by K 

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,080
equals 1. This is very important 

476
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,660
for our approach, because it looks like 
this 

477
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,280
. 0.001 times e to the power of kt divided 
by 1 

478
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,820
minus 0.001 times e to the power of kt 
minus 1. 

479
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,740
This is simply the initial value, 

480
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,320
one pupil at 8 o'clock. This is 

481
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,380
our final value and that's where we 

482
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,500
start. The important thing is that we 

483
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,280
have to determine the k. That's why 

484
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,240

485
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,460
up to seven students know. 0.007 

486
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,800
is equal to 0.001 times e to the power of 
k by 1 

487
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,540
plus 0.001 times e to the power of k minus 
1. 

488
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,220
First, we now multiply by 

489
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,040
the complete denominator so that the e 

490
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,280
 function comes to the other side 

491
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,700
and comes out of the denominator. 

492
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,560
This results in 0.007 times parenthesis to 
1 plus 0 

493
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,140
.001 times parenthesis to e to the power 
of k minus 1 

494
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,640
parenthesis to parenthesis. This is equal 
to 

495
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,620
0.001 times e to the power of k and next 

496
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,840
we 

497
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,420
resolve these two brackets here. In other 
words, we multiply 

498
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,680
them both out, i.e. 0.007 times 0.007 

499
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,860
times 1, which is 0.007 here. Then 

500
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,240
we continue with 0.007 times 0.001 

501
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,000
times e to the power of k, which is 7 
times 10 

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,580
to the power of minus 6 e to the power of 
k. Then 0.007 times 

503
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,980
0.001 times minus 1, which is minus 7 

504
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,300
times 10 to the power of minus 6. This is 
equal to 0 

505
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,380
.001 times e to the power of k. We 

506
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,980
now continue to try to 

507
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,720
isolate our E or to 

508
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,800
isolate our E to the power of K. We now 
want to 

509
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,940
summarize this on the right-hand side and 

510
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,240
that's why we move it 

511
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,100
over first. 

512
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,020
So we calculate minus 7 times 10 to the 
power of 

513
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,560
minus 6 E to the power of K so that the 
part appears on 

514
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,780
the other side. We 

515
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,740
get 0.007-7-10-6 is equal to 0 

516
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:57,900
.001-7-10-6 times e to the power of k. So 
we 

517
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,920
've already summarized that right away 

518
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,320
and only have 

519
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,760
e to the power of k there. And the 

520
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,180
only thing we have to do now 

521
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,260
to isolate our e to the power of k is to 

522
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,000
divide by the brackets here again. 

523
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,060
If we divide by 0.001 minus 7 times 10 

524
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,600
to the power of minus 6, we get 

525
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,440
this nice fraction and see that our 

526
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
e to the power of k stands alone. And now 

527
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,980
comes a well-known calculation technique. 

528
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,580
We use the logarithm 

529
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,300

530
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,840
to get the k out of our exponent . So we 
now form 

531
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,080
the logarithm of 0.007 minus 7 times 

532
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,460
10 to the power of minus 6 by 0.001 minus 
7 

533
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,320
times 10 to the power of minus 6. And that 
is then 

534
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,300
equal to our k and if we 

535
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,820
enter this term here in the calculator, 

536
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,680
the logarithm, we get 1.952 

537
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,780
. Consequently, our 

538
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,460
growth function n of t is 0.001 times e 

539
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,600
to the power of 1.952t by 1 minus 0.001 
times E 

540
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,220
to the power of 1.952t minus 1. The task 
is then 

541
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,120
already solved. 

542
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,220
Thank you for your attention.
