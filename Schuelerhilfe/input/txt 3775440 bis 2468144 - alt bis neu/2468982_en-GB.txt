00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,020
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,080
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,980
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain to you 

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,580
what 

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,460
the molecule glucose is all about in 
chemistry. 

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,060
We know from the suffix Ose 

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,460
that it is a sugar 

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,400
. But which sugar? 

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,140
Fructose, glucose or 

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,600
table sugar? And what are sugars 

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,420
anyway? Sugars are carbohydrates. 

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,220
A distinction is made 

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,380
between monosaccharides, oligosaccharides 
and 

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,400
polysaccharides. Monosaccharides 

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,680
, also known as simple sugars 

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,060
, are a single ring 

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,460
consisting of 3 to 7 carbon atoms. 

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,220
Oligosaccharides 

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,660

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,500

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,200
are made up of 2 to 10 monosaccharides 
that are linked by an oxygen bridge. 
Polysaccharides are 

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,240
high-molecular natural substances that 
consist of 

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,020
many linked monosaccharides 

24
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,520
. Glucose is a 

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,620
monosaccharide that 

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,720
has a 6C ring. 

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,500

28
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,520

29
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,400
Sucrose is a disaccharide, i.e. a 
disaccharide made up of glucose and 
fructose . 

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,300
The macromolecule 

31
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,660
starch is also made up of glucose . The 
molecular formula of glucose 

32
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,300
is C6H12O6. 

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,740
However, there are 

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,720
different ways of representing the 
structural formula. The 

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,060
Fischer projection, the Haworth 

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,620
 projection, the armchair representation 

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,380
and the stereochemical view. The 

38
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,860
Fischer projection is an 

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,640
open-chain form of representation. 

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,740

41
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,320
This makes it the easiest way to recognize 
the basic structure. Glucose 

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,940
has an aldehyde group. The carbon atom 

43
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,820
within the aldehyde group is always 

44
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,320
the first carbon atom in the chain. 

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,240
All others are 

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,940
counted through from this C atom. The 
arrangement of the 

47
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,980
hydroxyl group is also 

48
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,400
very important. 

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
The position of the 

50
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,560
hydroxyl group of the fifth C atom is used 
to differentiate 

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,660
between D-glucose and 

52
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,600
 L-glucose. Now we come 

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
to the glucose ring closure and the 

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,260
Haworth projection. The ring closure takes 
place 

55
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,840
in such a way that the 

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,880
hydroxyl group of the 5th C atom bonds 
with the 

57
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,920
C atom of the aldehyde group. 

58
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,500
The double bond of the 

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,280
oxygen atom dissolves 

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,340
and another hydroxyl group is formed. 

61
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,120
However, as this representation 

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,060
is very confusing , the 

63
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,840
Haworth projection is usually used. This 
means 

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,440
that all hydroxyl groups that 

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,860
were on the right in the Fischer 
projection 

66
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,220
are now at the bottom. This form is 

67
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,660
known as alpha-D-glycopyranose. 

68
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,180
In addition to the Haworth projection 

69
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,720
, the alpha-D-glycopyranose can also be 
depicted in the 

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,880
armchair view and in the 

71
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,300
stereochemical view. 

72
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,080
In all three types of illustration 

73
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,200
, you can see which hydroxyl groups 

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,660
are at the top and which are at the 
bottom. 

75
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,200
Let us briefly summarize once again. 

76
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,020
Glucose is a monosaccharide 

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,760
made up of 6 C atoms. The 

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,800
molecular formula is C6H12O6. 

79
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,240
In linear form, glucose 

80
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,620
has one aldehyde and 5 hydroxyl groups. 

81
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,800
The hydroxyl group on the 5th C atom 

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,500
indicates whether it is D-glucose or 
L-glucose 

83
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,660
. If a glucose 

84
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,840
 ring closure occurs, a 

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,580
bond is formed between the oxygen, 

86
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,780
the hydroxyl group of the fifth C atom 

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,900
and the first C atom. The 

88
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,480
aldehyde group is 

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,140
restructured into a hydroxy group. The 

90
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,160
ring form can 

91
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,080

92
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,980

93
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,800
be depicted as a Haworth projection, 
armchair representation or as a 
stereochemical view. In all forms of 
illustration 

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,240
, it must be noted whether the 

95
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,780
hydroxyl group 

96
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,740
was on the right or left in the linear 
form. I 

97
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,940
hope that I 

98
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,720
was able to help you better understand the 
topic of glucose 

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,500
. Thank you for joining us 

100
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,080
and see you next time!
