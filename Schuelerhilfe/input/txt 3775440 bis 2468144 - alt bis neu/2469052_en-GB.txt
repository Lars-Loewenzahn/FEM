00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,100
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,160
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,240
Schülerhilfe. I'm happy to 

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,340

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,880

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,980
explain the topic of valence electrons and 
valence line notation to you today. Let's 
start by looking 

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,640
at the shell model, which 

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,900
assumes that the 

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,520
electrons surround the atomic nucleus in 

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,280
concentric shells. The 

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,120
number of electrons 

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,800
corresponds to the number of protons, i.e. 
the 

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,440
atomic number. The shells are 

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,580
filled from the inside out. One 

15
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,420
shell must be full before 

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,220
electrons 

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,700
can enter the next one. The first shell 
holds 

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,540
a maximum of two electrons. The second 

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,180
holds a maximum of eight. The third shell 

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,520
initially also holds eight. The 

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,400
period in which an element is located 

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,020
indicates how many 

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,860
shells it has. Chlorine 

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,700
, which is in the third period and 

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,080
has the atomic number 17, has three 

26
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,480
shells on which the 

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,820
electrons are distributed as follows. Two 

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,120
in the first, eight in the second 

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,400
and seven in the third shell. 

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,380
Today we will only focus on the electrons 

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,500
in the outermost shell. These 

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,680
outer electrons of an atom are the 

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
valence electrons. They are involved in 

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,740
bonds between atoms. 

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,400
In the main group elements, 

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,040
the main group number corresponds to the 

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,720
number of valence electrons. 

38
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,240
Alkali metals each have one 

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,080
valence electron, alkaline earth metals 

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,500
each have two and so on. These 

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
valence electrons can be 

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,800

43
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,900
easily represented using the so-called 
Levis or valence notation 

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,400
. A dot symbolizes 

45
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,500
one electron and a dash two 

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,840
electrons, which 

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,820
are to be regarded as a pair of electrons. 
Now the atoms of 

48
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,740
all elements strive to have a completely 

49
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,280
filled outer shell, as is the case 

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,260
with the noble gases, the elements of the 

51
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,480
eighth main group. This 

52
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,120
is usually 

53
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,280
eight electrons according to the octet 
rule. In order to 

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,900
achieve this goal, 

55
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,320
ions can be formed or 

56
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,220
electron pair bonds 

57
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,960

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,780
can be established between the bonding 
partners. While the formation of ions 

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,660
involves a complete transfer of 

60
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,740
electrons from one atom to the 

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,660
other, in an 

62
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,060
electron pair bond the 

63
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,460
bonding partners share electron pairs in 
order to 

64
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,960

65
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,140
carry the full number of electrons in the 
outer shell . 

66
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
When atoms of the same 

67
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,700
element join together, they form as many 

68
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,880
electron pair bonds between them as 

69
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,100
each atom lacks valence electrons to 

70
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,940
achieve the noble gas configuration 

71
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,860
. 

72
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,440

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,580

74
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,560
There is a single bond between the 
chlorine atoms of the biatomic chlorine 
molecule consisting of two atoms. 

75
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,500
In the valence bond notation 

76
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
, the electron points of the 

77
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,820
two chlorine atoms are connected to form a 

78
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,760
horizontal 

79
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,460
line between the chlorine atoms, which 

80
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,300
represents the electron pair bond 

81
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,920
. As the chlorine atoms share 

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,900
an electron pair, 

83
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,280
both atoms achieve the noble gas 
configuration, 

84
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,900
in the case of chlorine the 

85
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,240
electron configuration of argon. 

86
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,560

87
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,580
 There is a so-called 

88
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,100
double bond between the oxygen atoms of 
the O2 molecule , so 

89
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
oxygen achieves the 

90
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,240
electron configuration of neon 

91
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,360
, as does nitrogen, where 

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,580

93
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,680
 a triple bond 

94
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,060
is formed between the nitrogen atoms of 
the N2 molecule . If we now look at 

95
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,760
compounds between atoms of 

96
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,660
different elements, we can 

97
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,260

98
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,640
easily 

99
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,460

100
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,040
establish the molecular formula and 
structural formula based on their electron 
configuration. Let's take a look 

101
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,720
at the combination of hydrogen 

102
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,720
and oxygen. Oxygen 

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,780
needs two electron pair bonds to 

104
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,780
fill up to eight outer electrons. A 

105
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,480
hydrogen atom can only 

106
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,380
form one electron pair bond, as 

107
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,700
each atom only has one electron. 

108
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,620
For this reason, an 

109
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,200
oxygen atom binds two hydrogen atoms. 

110
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,660
Oxygen reaches the configuration 

111
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,960
of neon and hydrogen that of 

112
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,820
helium. The H2O molecule 

113
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,300
is drawn at an angle because the 

114
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,620
electron pairs, both the free 

115
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,740
pairs and the bond pairs, 

116
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,880
need as much space as possible between 
them, as 

117
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,980
they are negative charges 

118
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,660
that repel each other. This maximum 

119
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,460
possible solid angle is the 

120
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,520
so-called tetrahedral angle and 

121
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,160
is 109.5° . It is 

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,800

123
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200

124
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,340
taken into account in the two-dimensional 
drawing of the structural formula of the 
H2O molecule . The bond angle in the 

125
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,320
water molecule is 104.45°, as the 

126
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,160
free electron pairs take up slightly more 

127
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,240
space than the 

128
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,340
electron pairs of the bond. 

129
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,040
If we now take a look at the combination 
of 

130
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,460
carbon and oxygen to form CO2 

131
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,100
, which also has a 2 to 1 ratio 

132
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,700
, it is 

133
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
noticeable when drawing the structural 
formula of the molecule 

134
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,820
that it is now linear. This is 

135
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,680
because the carbon atom 

136
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,660

137
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,460
has to form two double bonds to each of 
the oxygen atoms. The 

138
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,420
largest possible distance angle is 

139
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,580
therefore 180°. degrees. In the case of 

140
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,560
carbon, which as an atom in the 

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,700
valence line notation 

142
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,100
had one line and two points, 

143
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,880
the line for bonding is transformed into 
two 

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,180
points, because carbon must 

145
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,140
have four bonds in order to 

146
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
achieve the noble gas configuration 

147
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,940
. This means that carbon atoms 

148
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,480
can 

149
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,700
bind between two and four atoms, depending 
on which bonds, 

150
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,920
single or multiple, they 

151
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,800
form with the bonding partners. I hope 

152
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,140
that I have been able to help you 
understand the 

153
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,920
valence notation better 

154
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,600
and thank you for your 

155
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,480
attention.
