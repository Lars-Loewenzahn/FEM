00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,870
Hello, my name is Paula and I 

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,290
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,930
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,690
something about the amount of substance, 

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,290
Avogadro's constant, molar mass and 

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,790
molar volume. In our 

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,690
online learning center, you 

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,430
can of course also find a wiki on this 
topic 

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,970
, in which the 

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,530
basic and important terms 

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,650
are explained in more detail. As you 

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,310
may know, 

13
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,650
atoms and molecules are extremely small 

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,630
particles with a small mass that make up 

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,470
matter. In order to 

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,370
be able to carry out calculations and 

17
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,750

18
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,310
use reactants in the correct ratio for a 
reaction, 

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,670
a number of quantities and a 

20
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,490
constant are used, which I 

21
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,210
would like to discuss below. The amount of 
substance with 

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,530
the formula symbol n indirectly indicates 
the 

23
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,330
number of particles in a portion of 
substance. 

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,270
Particles can 

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,870
be atoms, ions or 

26
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,370
molecules. The quantity of substance is a 

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,090
mole. A quantity of substance of one mole 

28
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,230
always contains 6.022 times 10 to the 
power of 23 

29
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,810
particles. This number of 

30
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,650
particles contained in one mole is the 

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,730
so-called Avogadro constant, 

32
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,430
named after the Italian 

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,410
physicist Amedeo Avogadro. The 

34
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,010
Avogadro constant is a 

35
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,210
unitless number and is 

36
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,310

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,930

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,370
represented with a capital N and a 
subscript capital A as the formula symbol. 
This definition of the 

39
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,950
amount of substance and the knowledge of 
its 

40
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,090
exact number of particles 

41
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,810
allows the introduction of other 
quantities 

42
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,810
that 

43
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,590
make it easier to calculate with amounts 
of substance. For example, the 

44
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,290
amount of substance in a portion of 
substance can 

45
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,210
be obtained by 

46
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,490

47
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,930
dividing the mass of a portion of 
substance by the molar mass of the 
substance. The molar mass 

48
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,710
has the formula symbol M with the 

49
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,210
unit gram per mole. The molar 

50
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,870
mass of one gram per mole 

51
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,910
corresponds to the atomic mass unit, 

52
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,290
i.e. one unit or dorten. 

53
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,830
The molar mass of 

54
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,070
elements can therefore 

55
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,510
be taken from the periodic table, or PSE 
for short , in which each 

56
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,610
element is 

57
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,070
assigned its average atomic mass. The 
molar mass of 

58
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,570
compounds can be 

59
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,270

60
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,850

61
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,930
calculated by adding the molar masses of 
the atoms present in the compound. Water 
with the formula H2O 

62
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,390
contains two hydrogen atoms 

63
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,870
, each with one gram per mole, and one 

64
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,190
oxygen atom with 16 grams per mole. 

65
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,810
This means that the compound H2O has a 

66
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,930
molar mass of 18 grams per mole. 

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,490
Common salt, chemically sodium chloride 

68
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,150
, has a 

69
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,210
molar mass of 58.5 grams per mole after 
adding up the atomic mass. The 

70
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,150
molar mass is useful when 

71
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,730
working with solids or liquids 

72
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,890
because you 

73
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,510
can weigh them and thus 

74
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,050
calculate the quantities of substances 
present or 

75
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,870
use a desired quantity of substance. 

76
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,750
However, if you are working with gaseous 

77
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,370
substances, you use 

78
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,570
another quantity, the molar volume. 

79
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,910
The molar volume describes the 

80
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,550
volume 

81
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,490
occupied by one mole of a substance. In 
the case of gases, the 

82
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,310
molar volume does not depend on the type 
of 

83
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,990
substance. It is a so-called 

84
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,570
intensive quantity, a state quantity 

85
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,930
that 

86
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,330
does not change when the size of the 
system changes. One mole 

87
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,810
of an ideal gas, regardless 

88
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,330
of which gas it is, 

89
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,650

90
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,510

91
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,450

92
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,990
always occupies a 

93
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,010
volume of 22.4 liters under standard 
conditions, i.e. at atmospheric pressure 
and a temperature of 0°C Celsius . 

94
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,850
The unit of molar volume is 

95
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,670
therefore liters per mole. Now that we 
know all the 

96
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,610
quantities, we can 

97
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,210
go into the formulas. The amount of 
substance 

98
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,030
can 

99
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,710

100
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,950

101
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,450

102
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,450
be expressed both as a quotient of mass, 
formula symbol small m, and molar mass and 
also as a quotient of volume and molar 
volume . When working in 

103
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,370
liquids and solids 

104
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,150
, the first formula is usually used. 

105
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,410
However, the calculation 

106
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,830
with the molar volume is also possible 
here. For 

107
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,790
solids and liquids 

108
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,050
, the molar volume is the quotient 

109
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,110
of the molar mass and the density of the 

110
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,030
substance. The density has 

111
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,390
the Greek 

112
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,270
letter Rho and the unit gram 

113
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,570
per liter. The formulas 

114
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,790
are useful if you 

115
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,290

116
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,730
want to use reactants in the correct 
stichiometric ratio. Stichiometry 

117
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,490
itself is the study of the 

118
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,050
quantitative composition 

119
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,190
of chemical compounds and the 

120
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,870
mathematical calculation of chemical 

121
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,450
reactions. Let us consider the 

122
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,750
reaction of lithium and water to form 

123
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,730
hydrogen and lithium hydroxide. 

124
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,590
Two lithium atoms react with 

125
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,390
two water particles to form a 

126
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,610
hydrogen molecule and two particles of 

127
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,630
lithium hydroxide. Based on the 

128
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,270
calculation of the molar mass, 

129
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,910
it can be seen that using 14 

130
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,530
g of lithium produces 2 g of hydrogen. 

131
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,610
If you now 

132
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,370
ask yourself, for example, how much CO2 

133
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,190

134
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,290
is produced when one kilogram of metal is 
burned , this can 

135
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,890
also be 

136
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,970
determined using the corresponding 
reaction equation. 

137
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,530
One mole of methane with 16 g produces 

138
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,890
one mole of carbon dioxide with 44 g. 

139
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,310
The mass of one mole of CO2 corresponds to 

140
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,090
2.75 times the mass of one mole of 
methane. 

141
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,790
If 1 

142
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,710
kilogram of methane is converted instead 
of 16 grams 

143
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,930
, 2.75 kilograms of CO2 are produced. 

144
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,610
Similarly 

145
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,990
, 2.25 kilograms of water are produced 
from one kilogram of methane. These 

146
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,110
stereometric calculations can 

147
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,250
also be used to 

148
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,050

149
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,410
use reactants in the exact reaction ratio. 
For the 

150
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,310
combustion of methane, methane and 

151
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,650
oxygen are used in a mass ratio of 1 to 4 

152
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,710
or in a volume ratio of 

153
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,350
1 to 2 , as both reactants are gaseous. 

154
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,270
Nice that you were there again. 

155
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,850
