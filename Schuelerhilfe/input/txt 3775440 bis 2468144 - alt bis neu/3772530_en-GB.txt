00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,230
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,210
our webinar today. Can you 

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,230
hear me well? 

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,340
Hello, can you hear me? 

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,120
Okay, great. Then let's get 

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,420
started with our webinar 

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,760
on natural numbers. What are 

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,260
we going to talk about today? 

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,500
About the representation on the number 
line, about the 

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,900
representation of large numbers, the 

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,040
factual quantities via rounding and 

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,420
rolling over and about Roman 

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,420
numerals and the two-neck system. 

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,900
Let's get started. First of all, what are 

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,620
natural numbers? The set of 

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,200
natural numbers is 

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,400
abbreviated with the symbol n. n describes 
all 

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,200
positive numbers known to us, 

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,140
for example 1, 2, 3, 10, 50 to 

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,360
infinity, but only positive. 

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,220
As a rule, 0 does not belong to the 

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,480
natural numbers. 

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,660
However, if you want 0 to 

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,880
be part of the natural numbers, you write 
n with a 

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
small 0 at the bottom and then 

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,160
, of course, it starts at 0 to 

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,180
infinity. If you 

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,020
have any questions, please write in the 
chat, 

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,580
okay? Then let's start 

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,640
with the representation on the number 
line. 

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,900
n and n0 can be represented on the number 
line 

32
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,400
as follows. We 

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,100
just draw a number line and always with 

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,880
the positive numbers we know, 

35
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,140
okay, okay, from here the n-range is 

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,380
either starting from 1 or starting from 0 

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,180
, depending on whether we 

38
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,440
have n or n0. How do we now represent 
large 

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,520
numbers? There are several 

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,120
ways to 

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,220
represent large numbers in a simplified 
way. 

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,640
For example, if I take very large numbers, 
1000, 

43
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,640
then 

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,870
1000 million is a billion, 

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,190
i.e. a 1 with 9 zeros, and 100 

46
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,930
billion is a trillion. So 1 

47
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,110
with 12 zeros. 

48
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,310
If we 

49
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,150
look at the numbers that are written down 
here, 

50
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,250
we naturally ask ourselves 

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,330
which number is larger and which is 

52
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,610
smaller. To answer this question, 

53
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,130
we simply write them 

54
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,970
down one below the other in a place value 
table. 

55
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,490
In other words, we have the units, the 

56
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,510
tens, the hundreds, the thousands, the 

57
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,510
millions, the billions and the trillions. 

58
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,530
And then we simply 

59
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,830

60
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,270
enter the zeros and then the numbers one 
by one from the back to the front . and 
then 

61
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,070
we see that the number in front with the 
15 

62
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,410
is larger. 

63
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,990
Do you have any questions so far? 

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,340
Okay, then we'll continue with 

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,240
factual quantities. Ah, someone else has 

66
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,900
arrived. Very nice. Then we'll 

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,240
continue with the physical quantities. 
What are 

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,340
physical quantities? Material quantities 
are quantities 

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,240
such as length, weight, money and time. 

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,040
The quantities are always 

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
specified with a unit, i.e. lengths in 

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
kilometers, meters, decimeters. 

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Centimetres or millimetres, weight 

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
in tons, kilograms, grams and 

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
milligrams, money in euros and cents 

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,960
or, of course, 

77
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,440
depending on the currency, and time 

78
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,560
is 

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,840
given in years, months, days, hours, 
minutes and seconds. The 

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,460
units are given as 

81
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,480
natural numbers. So this 

82
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,280
simply means that we cannot go below 

83
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,360
1 or below 0, because 

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,460
going minus 5 kilometers makes no 

85
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,490
sense. So here we have the 

86
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,310
example that a school lesson 

87
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,710
takes 45 minutes, not minus 45 

88
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,130
minutes, which doesn't make sense either 

89
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,030
, so it stays in the 

90
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,610
positive range. Then the 1 liter 

91
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,210
of water weighs exactly 1 kilogram. 

92
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,750
The distance to school is 2 

93
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,310
kilometers and 450 meters. 

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,390
Lunch in our canteen costs 2 

95
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,150
.50 euros. And it took me 

96
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,430

97
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,850
13 minutes and 42 seconds to run 2 
kilometers on the 400-meter track . 

98
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,950
These are just a few 

99
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,530
examples of how we 

100
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,790
can use the material quantities. 

101
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,850
Are there any questions about the material 
quantities? 

102
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,730
Okay, I don't think so. Okay, also. Well, 
let's 

103
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,030
take a look at 

104
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,870
rounding and rolling over. Rounding, 

105
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,330
why do we round at all and 

106
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,370
why do we roll over? It 

107
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,830
simply means that we can represent numbers 
more simply 

108
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,050
and that we 

109
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,790
can calculate with them more easily and 
therefore 

110
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,130
do without the exact result. 

111
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,090
How is rounding done? We 

112
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,450
always look at the digit after the 

113
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,070
respective digit up to which we 

114
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,630
want to round. This means 

115
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,550
that if we want to round to tens 

116
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,850
, we look at the units. If we 

117
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,310
want to round to hundreds, we look at the 

118
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,390
tens. And if we want to round to 
thousands, we 

119
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,110
look at the hundreds. 

120
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,510
Because there are rules, if the rounding 

121
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,610
digit is a 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, then 

122
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,490
we round down. And if the digit 

123
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,730
is a 5, 6, 7, 8 or then it is 

124
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,750
rounded up. So let's say 

125
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,770
digits less than 5 are 

126
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,230
rounded down, digits greater than or 

127
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,510
equal to 5 are rounded up. 

128
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,710
Let's take a look at an example. The 

129
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,010
number 4 million, 4,000,000, nope, the 

130
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,720
number, uh, 6, nope, 4,000,000, nope, 467 

131
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,580
.372 should 

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,340

133
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,280
be rounded to tens, to hundreds and then 
to thousands . This means that when we 

134
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,100
round to tens, we 

135
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,380
look at the ones digit, i.e. 

136
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,940
2. 2 is smaller than 5, which 

137
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,980
means that if we round down, we get 

138
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,960
476,370. 

139
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,160
If we now round to hundreds, 

140
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,620
we look at the 

141
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,040
tens digit. The 7 is greater than 

142
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,560
the 5, so we round up to 

143
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,680
476,400. Now we look at the 

144
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,440
thousands place, i.e. we 

145
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,620
look at the hundreds place. This 

146
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,780
is the number 3, which is less than 

147
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,900
5, so we round down 

148
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,560
to 476,000. 

149
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,860
Now for the rollover. When 

150
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,100
rolling over, we simply 

151
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,780
calculate with rounded numbers to 

152
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,300
quickly and easily arrive at an almost 

153
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,020
correct result. For 

154
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,260
example, if we calculate 26 and 52, 

155
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,080
that's 78, but with our 

156
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,120
rounding up and down rule we calculate 30 
plus 

157
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,620
50, that would be 80, which is very close 

158
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,220
. If we calculate 81 minus 17, we 

159
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,240
get 64. With our rule 

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,360
, we calculate 80 minus 20, which means 

161
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,760
we get 60. If we 

162
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,820
calculate 610 plus 370, we actually get 

163
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,300
980 or we calculate 600 plus 400 

164
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,540
and get 1000. Exactly, 

165
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,980
you can also 

166
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,540
look at the other examples , the principle 
is actually 

167
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,600
always the same. 

168
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,580
The bottom example is 

169
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,320
rounded differently, once to 

170
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,580
the 100th digit and once to the 

171
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,000
10th digit. Exactly, 

172
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,450
but the results always 

173
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,750
almost match . 

174
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,020

175
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,400
Is there a question about rounding and 
rolling over? 

176
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,130
In which class do you find this? 

177
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,690
What class do you mean? 

178
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,250
At school. 

179
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,250
Huh? What do you mean by 5.8? 

180
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,980
Oh, at school. At school 

181
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,340
they often round in elementary school, 

182
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,260
but also at the beginning of 

183
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,100
secondary school. That means that fifth, 

184
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,740
sixth and seventh are 

185
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,880
rounded again and practiced. 

186
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,700
However, rounding is always important, 

187
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,600
because when odd numbers come in, 

188
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,740
you only ever enter two 

189
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,660
decimal places and then you 

190
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,520
also have to round, even in the upper 

191
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,700
levels. Then 

192
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,810

193
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,830
we continue with the Roman numerals 

194
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,450
and the system of two. Roman 

195
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,490
numerals are number symbols from 

196
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,050
Roman antiquity and are still used 

197
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,870
today for numbers and special 

198
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,290
purposes. 

199
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,190
The symbols replace the natural numbers. 

200
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,710
The symbols are 

201
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,230
arranged in order of size. You 

202
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,910
start with the largest symbol and 

203
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,790
end the number with the smallest 

204
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,170
symbol. However, if a smaller 

205
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,070
symbol is placed before a larger symbol, 

206
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,850
the smaller symbol is 

207
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,610
subtracted from the larger one. These are 
simply the 

208
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,530
generic rules. 

209
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,710
Let's take a look at this. We 

210
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,730
simply have one bar for the 1, 

211
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,990
two bars for the 2 and three bars for the 
3. 

212
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,970
The important thing with Roman numerals 

213
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,430
is that the 

214
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,210
same symbol must never appear more than 
three times in succession. 

215
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,050
This means that to make the 4, 

216
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,730
we write a 1 in front of the 5 and 

217
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,910
calculate 5 minus 1, because the 

218
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,830
smaller symbol is in front of the larger 
one. 

219
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,850
And it continues like this. Then 

220
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,230
we have the 

221
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,270
same thing again with the 9 , the x stands 
for a 10, 

222
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,870
so we write a 1 in front of the 

223
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,830
10 and use it to calculate 10 minus 1. 

224
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,990
Then there are a few 

225
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,650
more symbols, for example the L 

226
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,370
stands for 50, the C for 100, 

227
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,210
the D for 500 and the M for 1000. And 

228
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,790
if we 

229
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,210
wanted to write 2018, for example, we 
would 

230
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,210
write the M twice, so 

231
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,350
1000 plus 1000, then a 10, that 

232
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:06,250
would be the X, then the 5 and then 

233
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,590
three times the 1. And then we would 

234
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,010
calculate 1000 plus 1000 plus 10 plus 

235
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,650
5 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 and 

236
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,430
then we would arrive at 2018. 

237
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,380
Now for the system of two, are there 

238
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,840
any questions about the Roman 

239
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,180
numerals? 

240
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,930
Okay, then we come to the 

241
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,690
two-system. The two-system 

242
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,290
number system, which is 

243
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,890

244
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,270
limited to only two digits when 
representing natural numbers and 

245
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,390
these digits are the two numbers 

246
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,270
0 and 1. The two-system 

247
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,430
is also 

248
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,150
called the dual system or binary system 
and computers and electrical 

249
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,350
devices calculate in the two-system by 

250
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,170

251
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,130
interpreting electrical signals as a digit 
0 is off and 1 is on. 

252
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,990
Let's take another quick look at 

253
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,410
how this works. Natural 

254
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,370
numbers consist of different 

255
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,610
digits. There are ones, tens, 

256
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,490
hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands 

257
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,110
and so on. And since we 

258
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,350
only have two numbers in a system, there 
are 

259
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,290
other digits here. Namely the 

260
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,330
ones, twos, fours, eights 

261
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,870
, sixteens and two-thirties and so 

262
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,170
on . So we always 

263
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,410
start with 1 and always multiply by 2 to 

264
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,650
get to the next largest digit 

265
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,550
. Let's take a look at this in 

266
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,490
the table. There we also have 

267
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,950
another place value table in the 

268
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,030
system of two. As you can see, we 

269
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,710
now have 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s 

270
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,070
and 32s. This means that to 

271
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,710
get to 1, we would calculate a 1. 

272
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,110
You can just have a quick 

273
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,010
look at them , it's actually relatively 

274
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,270
self-explanatory. 

275
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,150
To write a 7, you would 

276
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,510
have a 1, 1, 1 as a dual number, because 

277
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,570
we would calculate 4 plus 2 plus 1. 

278
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,900
Exactly. Here we have more 

279
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,620
examples. For example, to get to 15 

280
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,180
, we would 

281
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,760
write 4, 1, nope, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 in a row, 

282
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,360
because we would 

283
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
calculate 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1. Exactly, 
and then 

284
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,320
you can see that there are sometimes zeros 

285
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,800
in between, for example, to get to 

286
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,940
10, we calculate 8 plus 2, 

287
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,120
but of course we have 

288
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,060
left out the 4 and the 1 digit, so 

289
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,680
there is a zero in there, so at noon 

290
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,640
we represent the 10, a 1 0 1 0. 

291
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,360
Is the two system roughly 

292
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,240
clear to you ? Have you understood it? 

293
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,800
Yes? Okay, because that brings us to 

294
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,880
the end. Thank you 

295
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,780
for your attention and if 

296
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,200
you still have any questions 

297
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,520
, please feel free to ask them and 

298
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,280
otherwise you are 

299
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,320
welcome to leave this webinar . I hope you 
have a 

300
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,180
great weekend. Exactly. 

301
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,130
Have a nice weekend. Bye.
