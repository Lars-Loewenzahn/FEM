00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,100
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,160
am a tutor 

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,980
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain to you 

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,660
what 

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,020
proteins are all about in biology . As a 
basis for 

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,500
this topic, you will 

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,540
of course also find a 

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,040
wiki in our online learning center. 
Proteins 

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,040

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,760
are a main component of our 

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,940
diet alongside fats, carbohydrates and 
sugars . Protein-rich 

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,180
foods include 

13
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,360
meat, lentils and nuts. 

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,640
Based on this list alone, we 

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,740
can conclude that there are 

16
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,220
different types of proteins 

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,180
. In fact, 

18
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,300
in addition to their function as a 

19
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,080
source of nutrients , proteins also 
fulfill these 

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,620
tasks. 1. as catalysts in 

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,540
chemical reactions in the form of 

22
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,580
enzymes. 2. they enable our 

23
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,820
movement due to 

24
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,460
muscle filaments. 3. as a 

25
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,440
scaffolding substance, e.g. for hair. 4. 
as a 

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,220
transport molecule such as haemoglobin. 
And 

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,400
fifthly, as part of our 

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,600
immune system in the form of antibodies. 

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,540
But what are proteins anyway? 

30
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,580
Proteins are macromolecules 

31
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,280
made up of amino acids. This is 

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,900
the general structural formula 

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,100
of an amino acid. There is the 

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,180
central C atom, which is joined by an H 
atom, 

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,540
an amino group, a carboxyl group 

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,480
and an organic residue in this 

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,140
constellation. Now 

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,580
you know the basic building blocks of a 

39
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,480
protein, but 

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,320
we are still a long way from the actual 
macromolecule 

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,800
. This is 

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,540
only the case when at least 

43
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,440
100 amino acids 

44
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,620
have been linked together. The linking 

45
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,480
of two amino acids takes place via the 

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,100
so-called peptide bonds. Here, 

47
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,540
an H atom of the amino group 

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,380
of one amino acid reacts with the OH 

49
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,440
 group of the other amino acid to form 

50
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,000
water and a direct 

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,700
bond is formed between the N and C atoms 
of 

52
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,940
the two groups. The newly 

53
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,860
formed molecule is called a di 

54
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,180
-peptide. This process 

55
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,760
can be repeated as often as required 

56
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,340
until a polypeptide is finally 

57
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,920
formed . In a protein, 

58
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,560
the polypeptide chain forms the 

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
primary structure, whereby the sequence of 
the 

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,080
individual amino acids 

61
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,380
is decisive . The chain arranges 

62
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,020

63
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,200
itself locally into three-dimensional 
structures due to hydrogen bonds 

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,480
. The best-known forms include 

65
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
the alpha-helix and the 

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,420
 beta-pleated sheet. Together with 

67
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,320
other forms , they form the 

68
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,100
secondary structures. The 

69
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,960
tertiary structure is formed by an 

70
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,820
asymmetrical arrangement of 

71
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,900
 alpha-helixes and beta-pleated sheets 

72
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,580
within a polypeptide chain. This is 

73
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,120
achieved by 

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,980
hydrogen bonding, Van der 

75
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,120
Waals bonding and 

76
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,200
electron pair bonding. Some 

77
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,320
proteins are already complete. 

78
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,620
In the quaternary structure, 

79
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,560
several polypeptide chains arrange 
themselves into a 

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,580
common protein complex. 

81
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,000
The protein shown here 

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,320
is haemoglobin. To conclude, here 

83
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,520
are the most important 

84
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,360
points about proteins. They have 

85
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,260
a variety of functions and consist 

86
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,200
of several hundred amino acids. 

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
They have different 

88
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,560
structural levels, which 

89
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,320
have the following hierarchical 
arrangement. 

90
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,640
Primary structure, the polypeptide chain, 

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,200
secondary structures, local, spatial 

92
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,440
structures within the 

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,800
polypeptide chain such as alpha-helix and 

94
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,640
beta-pleated sheet, the tertiary 
structure, 

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,840
i.e. the spatial arrangement of the 

96
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
entire polypeptide chain, already 

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,860
sufficient to obtain a 

98
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,400
single-chain protein and the 

99
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,260
quaternary structure, i.e. the spatial 

100
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,460
combination of several 

101
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,360
polypeptide groups to form a 

102
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,920
protein complex. I hope that I 

103
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,640
have been able to help you understand the 
topic of proteins 

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
. In order to 

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,260
deepen the content even further, 

106
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,880
there are of course 

107
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,740
other learning opportunities available to 
you in the online learning center, 

108
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,160
such as interactive 

109
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,380
tasks, worksheets or 

110
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,080
webinars.
