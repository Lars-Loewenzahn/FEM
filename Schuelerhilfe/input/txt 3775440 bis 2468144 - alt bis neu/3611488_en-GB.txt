00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,070
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,310
Divisibility of natural numbers. 

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,050
In this webinar , we will look at the 

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,730
divisibility of natural numbers 

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,430
. Therefore, we will first 

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,250
look at what a divisor 

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,370
and a multiple is. After that, 

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,750
we will look at the final digit and the 

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,810
sum of digits rule and look at the 

10
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,850
corresponding rules for multiple 

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,890
divisors. Then we'll look 

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,990
at the prime factorization 

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,090
and finally we'll determine the greatest 

14
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,630
common parts and the least 

15
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,250
common multiple, 

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,150
using the n c of quersum rule and 

17
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,970
the prime factorization 

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,150
, and we'll start 

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,510
with multiples and multiples 

20
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,690
of a number are 

21
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,590
always created by multiplying 

22
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,370
these numbers by natural numbers 

23
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,030
, i.e. no matter what number we 

24
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,090
have, if we 

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,770
multiply it by a natural number, 

26
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,910
we get a multiple of it, 

27
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,310
i.e. a multiple of the number that 

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,510
is multiplied. This means 

29
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,750
that we now have 4 as a number and are 

30
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,890
now forming multiples of this 4. 

31
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,590
We do this by 

32
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,450
multiplying 4 by the natural numbers 

33
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,910
or by 

34
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,650
multiplying it by natural numbers , i.e. 4 
times 2. The 2 

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,050
is a natural number, so 

36
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,110
this is absolutely legitimate and so we 
arrive 

37
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,410
at 8 4 x 3 is 12 4 x 4 is 16 and 

38
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,930
we can you see 2 3 4 we can 

39
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,530

40
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,530
go through the whole series of natural 
numbers, i.e. to 

41
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,850
infinity and these are then all 

42
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,330
multiples of the 4 so every 

43
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,410
natural number that we 

44
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,110
multiply by the 4 is in the end the 

45
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,490
product of both is then a 

46
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,670
multiple of the 4 so we 

47
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,770
then arrive at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. There 
would 

48
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,730
still be the 24 and the 28 and it goes 

49
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,970
on and on like this. That's why there are 

50
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,770
three dots here , because 

51
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,030
there are an infinite number of multiples 
. It is important to note 

52
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,670
that each number is also 

53
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,530
its own multiple, 

54
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,670
because 1 is a natural number. 

55
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,670
Therefore 4 times 1. We can 

56
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,450
multiply any number by 1 and as a 

57
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,730
result we get 

58
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,130
our number again. And therefore 4 times 1 
is 

59
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,930
4, or in other words, every number is 

60
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,270
also its own 

61
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,850
multiple. That's why you also 

62
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,750
see 4 in the first place. Perhaps 

63
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,710
one or two more general words 

64
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,230
on the subject of natural numbers. Natural 

65
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,230
numbers are all numbers that are whole 

66
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,510
and positive. And that's why 

67
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,790
we'll also be using them in the rest of 

68
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,450
the webinar. 

69
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:55,210
Now let's move on to the divisor. 

70
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,070
12 divided by 4 is 3 and 12 

71
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,870
divided by 6 is 2 and 12 divided 

72
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,550
by 12 is 1. We only see 

73
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,990
whole numbers here or we have no 

74
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,610
decimals or no remainder. Therefore, 

75
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,130
1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 are 

76
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,190
also divisors of 12. And this brings us 

77
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,570
to the first rule. 

78
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,210
Every number is also 

79
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,970
its own divisor. Because we can 

80
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,750
divide every number by itself 

81
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,890
and get no remainder. 

82
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,530
The result is always 1. Whenever we 

83
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,070
divide a number by itself 

84
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,670
, we get 1. And at the same time 

85
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,490
, of course, 1 is always a 

86
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,330
divisor of the number. This means that 
when 

87
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,210
we divide a number by 1, we 

88
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,450
get the number again. Therefore, 

89
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,950
1 is always a divisor 

90
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,010
of every number and for every number, the 
number is 

91
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,850
part of it. 

92
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,490
What is also detailed here 

93
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,150
, if we look at it 

94
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,670
graphically, we now only have 

95
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,850
the 1 from the equal sign on the left 

96
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,770
and the 12 on the right. Below it is 
exactly the 

97
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,630
opposite. Here we have 

98
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,450
2 on the left and 6 on the right, here we 
have 

99
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,950
6 on the left and 2 on the right 

100
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,990
. This means that if we 

101
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:38,930
divide a number by A, 

102
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,970
the result is also a divisor of this 
number. 

103
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,110
This means that x divided by A is 

104
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,710
equal to b. Then A and b are divisors 

105
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,850
of the number. We can also see this here. 

106
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,990
12 divided by 4 is equal to 3. 

107
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,990
3 is also a divisor of the number 

108
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,470
, as it is written above. 12 divided by 

109
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,490
3 is 4, which means 

110
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,170
that both numbers are also divisors 

111
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,310
of the number. In addition, 

112
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,010
the number to the left of the 

113
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,050
divisor sign is 

114
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,790
a multiple of a and also of b. This 

115
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,460
also applies. That's it 

116
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,940
for now. about divisors and multiples. 

117
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,820
We will definitely 

118
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,840
need this later. 

119
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,180
For now, however, we will deal with the 
final digit 

120
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,920
rule and the sum of digits rule. We will 
need these 

121
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,620
later to check divisors. This is because 
it 

122
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,320
is not 

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
easy to find all the divisors 

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,740
or to 

125
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,740
check a divisor when the numbers get 
bigger. An example of this is 816 

126
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,160
, which is not too 

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,820
big yet , but 

128
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,620
I think the problem is already clear. You 
can't 

129
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,840
check divisors or 

130
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,920
identify multiple divisors that quickly. 
That's why 

131
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,960
the final digit and cross sum rules were 

132
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,480
invented. These are used for 

133
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,120
quick verification. This means that 

134
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,840
we can use them to quickly check 

135
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,640
whether a number 

136
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,180
is a divisor of a given number. In other 
words, we 

137
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,060
can use a rule to 

138
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,300
check a specific divisor. 

139
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,260
We' ll see that in a moment. On the next 

140
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,840
slide, various parts are 

141
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,260
written down and the corresponding 

142
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,560
rule for these parts. Let's move on 

143
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,980
to the final digit, because 

144
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,300
we'll need the final digit in a moment. 
The 

145
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,780
final digits are the last digits. 

146
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,640
They can be the ones, the 

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,100
tens and the hundreds. Sometimes 

148
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,040
it's just the last digit, the last 

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,740
digit, then it's the ones or 

150
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,900
, for example, the last two 

151
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,400
digits, then it's the tens and 

152
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,860
one or the last three digits 

153
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,920
then it's the hundreds and 

154
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,140
one that depends on the part 

155
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,480
we want to check that's 

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,540
on the next slide and then 

157
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,780
it will probably also become clear 

158
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,680
the cross sum of a number is formed 

159
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
by adding its digits 

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,260
, i.e. we have 816 here and 

161
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,440
we calculate the cross sum by 

162
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,900

163
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,020
forming the sum of the individual digits , 
i.e. 8 plus 1 plus 6 and that 

164
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,100
's 15. In other words, the sum of the 
digits 

165
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,760
of the number 816 is 15. And 

166
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,360
the sum of the digits can then be used to 

167
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,200
determine divisors or check divisors. 

168
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,060
And now we come to that. We can 

169
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,820
always 

170
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,140
see the divisor that we 

171
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,420
are currently looking at, shown here in 
green on the left. 

172
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,000
The whole thing is to be understood as 
follows. If we 

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,640
want to know, or if a number 

174
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
has the divisor 2, then the 

175
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,260
final digit is even. That is always the 

176
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,840
rule and that is the divisor we are 

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,160
checking. There is always an 

178
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,420
example on the right. So, if a number 

179
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,580
has a divisor of 2, then the 

180
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,580
final digit is even. In other words, we 

181
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,860
have 1984 here and if we 

182
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,340
want to know whether 1984 has a 

183
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,440
divisor of 2, we look at the 

184
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,260
last digit. So the last digit, 

185
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,700
that's 4, and see if it 

186
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,360
's even. The 4 is even, 

187
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,640
so the 1984 is an integer 

188
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,980
divisible by 2. So it has a 

189
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,740
divisor of 2. If we want to know whether 

190
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,380
a number has a divisor of 4, then 

191
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,340
we look at the last two 

192
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,060
digits. These must 

193
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,740
be divisible by 4. This means 

194
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,040
that we have 232 here. The last two 

195
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,600
digits are the 10s and the 

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,780
1s, so we have 32 And we 

197
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,800
now have to see whether the 4 

198
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,440
is a divisor of 32 It is in this case, 

199
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,640
so the 4 is also a divisor of 232 

200
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,060
This means that if the 4 

201
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,400
is a divisor of the last two digits 

202
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,080
, then the 4 is also a divisor of the 
whole number This is how 

203
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,940
it should be understood It is similar 

204
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,460
with the 8. A number is 

205
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,500
divisible by 8 or 

206
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,920
has the divisor 8 if the last 

207
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,180
three digits have the divisor 8. 

208
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,000
This means that we have 46,064, the 

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
last three digits, which are the 

210
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,720
100s, the 10s and the 1s. And we 

211
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,400
now check whether these 

212
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,740
are divisible by 8. The 64 has the divisor 

213
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,720
8, therefore the 46,000. 64 is also 

214
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,860
divisible by 8. And that brings us 

215
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,260
to the divisor 5. The 

216
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,920
divisor 5 is always quite pleasant, 

217
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,260
because a number has the divisor 5 if 

218
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,400
its final digit 

219
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,660
is a 0 or a 5. This means that we 

220
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,160
really only ever have to 

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,180
look at the final digit. In the case of 
151 

222
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,180
.065 , this is  5. And as I said, if the 

223
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,940
final digit is a 0 or a 5, 

224
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
then the number has the divisor 5 in 

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
our case. If the final digit is a 5, this 
means that 

226
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,500
151.065 has the divisor 5. And that 

227
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,020
brings us to the divisor 10. The divisor 

228
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,100
10 is the simplest case, namely 

229
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,780
every number has the divisor 10 if it 

230
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,400
has a 0 as the final digit and really 

231
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,680
only a 0. We can see immediately that 

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,540
the number has a 0 at the end, so 

233
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,160
it definitely has the divisor 10. The 

234
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,320
divisor 10 is therefore always quite 

235
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,440
simple and is therefore often a 

236
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,340
good starting point for the prime 

237
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,560
factorization that we 

238
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,660
will look at later, we come to the divisor 
25 the 

239
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,380
divisor 25 or a number has the 

240
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,520
divisor 25 if the last two 

241
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,240
digits are 00 25 50 or 75 

242
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
that means if we want to know if 

243
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,300
a number has the divisor 25 

244
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
we only look at the last two 

245
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,120
digits and either it is only 0 

246
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,440
25 50 or 75 in our case we have 

247
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
the 516.875 so we have 

248
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
75 in the last two digits 

249
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,920
so the whole number is 

250
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,000
divisible by 25 so it has the 

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,440
divisor 25. Next we come to 

252
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,800
the divisor 3. You can determine whether 

253
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,660
a number has the divisor 3 by 

254
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,980
checking the sum of the digits. A 

255
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,060
number has the divisor 3 if its 

256
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,600
sum of digits also has the divisor 3. 

257
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,500
This means that the first thing we have to 
do is find the 

258
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,620
sum of the digits of the number We have 

259
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,800
8613 here as an example. The sum of the 
digits 

260
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,880
of 8613 is then 8 plus 6 plus 1 

261
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,620
plus 3. That's 18. And we 

262
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,740
now consider whether 18 has the divisor 

263
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,560
3. And it does. 3 times 6 is 

264
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,180
18, or the 18 has the 

265
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,260
divisor 3. Therefore, the 8613 also has 
the 

266
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,680
divisor 3. We can therefore say that. 

267
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,360
Similarly, 

268
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,840
if we want to know whether a number 

269
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,800
has the part in 9, we 

270
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,620
first determine the sum of the digits and 
see whether 

271
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,200
the sum of the digits has the part in 9. 

272
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,560
Here we have the 4,221, the sum of the 
digits 

273
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,280
is then 9, so 4 plus 2 plus 2 plus 

274
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,480
1 is 9 and the 9 has the part in 9, 

275
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,920
so the 4,221 is also 

276
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,300
divisible by 9 or has the 

277
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,140
divisor 9. It is a little more difficult 

278
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,840
with the divisor 6 and the divisor 15. 

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,920
If we want to know whether a number 

280
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,900
has the divisor 6, we first have to 

281
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,660
check whether it has the divisor 2. 

282
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,960
This means that we first look at the 

283
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,040
rule for divisor 2 and check 

284
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
this. If it has the divisor 2, 

285
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,420
we still have to check whether it also has 

286
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,200
the divisor 3. In other words, we 

287
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,280
then check the divisor 3 with the 

288
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,000
rule here. 

289
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,680
If it has the divisor 2 and the divisor 3, 

290
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,260
it also has the divisor 6. If it 

291
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,040
has only one of the two parts or 

292
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,520
neither of them, then it does not have 

293
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,580
the divisor 6. So the number must 

294
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,780
have the divisor 2 and divisor 3 so that 

295
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,820
it also has the divisor 6, otherwise 

296
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,830
it does not. In principle, 

297
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,430
we also proceed in the same way with the 
divisor 15. 

298
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,010
In order for a number to have the divisor 
15, 

299
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,930
we must first check whether it 

300
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,490
has the divisor 3. In other words, we 

301
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,970
perform the operation here for the 

302
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,590
divisor 3. We check whether the number 

303
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,450
has the divisor 3. And then 

304
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,250
we check whether it has the divisor 5 

305
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,450
. So we look at the 

306
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,810
final digits. If it has both divisors 

307
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,090
, then it definitely has the 

308
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,270
divisor 15. If it only 

309
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,970
has one of the two divisors or 

310
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,490
neither of them, then it doesn't have the 
divisor 

311
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,110
15. And that's it 

312
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,210
for the end digit and cross sum rule for 
now. 

313
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,410
And that brings us to the 

314
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,690
prime factorization. First of all, let's 

315
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,310
talk about prime numbers in general. A 

316
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,530
prime number is a number that is only 

317
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,230
divisible by itself and 1. 

318
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,010
It is therefore only 

319
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,670
divisible by two natural numbers, namely 

320
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,230
1 and itself. This is what 

321
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,510
we have just 

322
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,730
learned about the divisors above. Every 
number is 

323
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,650
divisible by 1 and by itself. And 

324
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,290
prime numbers have the special feature 

325
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,850
that they 

326
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,890
are only divisible by 1 and by themselves. 
The 

327
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,970
first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 

328
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:49,070
11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 

329
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,710
43, 47 and so on. 

330
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,370
It is advisable not to use all the 

331
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,970
prime numbers... There are also an 
infinite 

332
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,450
number, so it is only advisable to 

333
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,770

334
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,350
know the first 10 to 15 by heart. That is 
enough. Because it is 

335
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,170
important to know the prime numbers 

336
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,030
or to know some prime numbers, 

337
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,870
because you need them for the 

338
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,410
prime factorization. 

339
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,890
We'll see what that is in a moment. As I 
said, 

340
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,950
we need them for this. 

341
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,590
Furthermore, every 

342
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,930
natural number 

343
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,790
can be represented as a product of prime 
numbers. This 

344
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,230
means that every natural number can 

345
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,110

346
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,390
be represented as a product of prime 
numbers. And the 

347
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,730
prime factorization is the 

348
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,570
calculation method for representing this 
natural 

349
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,930
number with prime factors. 

350
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,090
In other words, we see here that 60 is 
equal to 5 

351
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,410
times 3 times 2 times 2. 5, 3 and 

352
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,410
2 are prime numbers. 

353
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,890
This means that the prime factorization 
was 

354
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,350
carried out here and these 4 numbers here 

355
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,970
are the prime factors. 

356
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,990
And that brings us to the 

357
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,350
actual prime factorization. 

358
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,610
We also have a 

359
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,010
small example to 

360
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,630
demonstrate this. Of course, it's not 

361
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,150
immediately obvious that 60 

362
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,970
equals 5 times 3 times 2 times 2. 

363
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,190
Perhaps the trained eye sees it 

364
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,430
and if you see it immediately and it 

365
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,210
is correct, you can 

366
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,650
write it down straight away. 

367
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,950
However, the numbers are usually somewhat 
larger and 

368
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,990
then you can't do it so 

369
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,790
quickly. That's why you do it factor 

370
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,390
by factor. 

371
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,550
It doesn't matter in which order you find 
the factors. 

372
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,330
After all, it's a product, i.e. a 

373
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,550
multiplication, and we can 

374
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,070
swap the elements around as we like. 

375
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,970
In other words, the order in which we 

376
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,450
find the factors doesn't matter 

377
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,670
Prime factors often 

378
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,230
occur several times , so this is not 
uncommon And 

379
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,910
these prime factors that 

380
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,190
occur several times can either be 

381
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,430
written as a power or simply 

382
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,010
left one after the other But 

383
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,570
never multiply them out This is 

384
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,010
very important, never 

385
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,890
multiply them out If we now 

386
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,290
multiply 2 times 2, 

387
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,850
we get 4 and 4 is 

388
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,670
not a prime number. Therefore, we have 

389
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,910
not 

390
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,370
carried out a prime factorization . In 
other words, 

391
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,470
only prime numbers are allowed at the end 

392
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,130
and they must be multiplied several times, 
i.e. the 

393
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,270
same number several times. In order to 
find suitable prime numbers 

394
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,030
, the final digit and 

395
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,670
cross sum rule is useful. We 

396
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,410

397
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,990
learned the rule for 2, 3 and 5 earlier. 
That gets you 

398
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,490
quite far. 

399
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,530
And you can 

400
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,210
use these rules to good effect. If 
necessary, you can of course 

401
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,190
also check prime numbers. 

402
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,890
Of course, you want to 

403
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,270
find the largest possible divisor so that 
the 

404
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,770
numbers become small very quickly. 

405
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,270

406
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,890
The prime factorization is easier to 

407
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,170
carry out with small numbers because you 

408
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,770
know the corresponding prime numbers more 
quickly. We 

409
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,410
only really know the first ones and 

410
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,390
if we 

411
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,230

412
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,550
were to form a multiplication of 19 times 
23 , it would quickly become 

413
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,670
confusing, so it is very 

414
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,990
practical if we first make the numbers 

415
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,430
small and then 

416
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,370
carry out the prime factorization. 

417
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,950
This means that we don't have to 

418
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,550

419
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,290
have a product of prime numbers here 
immediately. We can 

420
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,030
proceed step by step and only at the end, 
when we 

421
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,450

422
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,990
have completed the prime factorization , 
may only 

423
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,750
prime numbers remain. 

424
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,130
We can also see this in the example 

425
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,030
we have here. We are supposed to 

426
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,550
decompose the 420 into its prime factors. 
And that's 

427
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,210
what I mean. 

428
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,410
We see that we have 1, 2, 3, 4 

429
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,490
steps here and we only have 

430
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,610
prime numbers in this step 

431
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,750
. So you start very easily 

432
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,210
and first break the number down into 

433
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,990
factors. We can see that 

434
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,350
420 is divisible by 10, simply 

435
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,610
because it has 0, you can see that 

436
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,210
immediately. And that's why we write 

437
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,790
420 as 10. 42. What we 

438
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,170
also see immediately is that 

439
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,650
we can write 10 as 5 times 2. This 

440
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,750
is a very good step because, 

441
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,870
as I said, 10 is divisible by 5, 

442
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,310
2 times and 2 and 5 are 

443
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,310
already prime numbers. So we 

444
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,210
now have 2 prime numbers and we 

445
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,270
only have 42. 42 is 

446
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,910
already an even number and an 

447
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,130
even number can never 

448
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,530
be a prime number because all even 

449
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,890
numbers are divisible by 2. The 2 is 

450
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,710
an exception. The 2 

451
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,590
is the only even number that is a 

452
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,430
prime number. Well, 

453
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,000
as I said, we have 42, 

454
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,140
which means we can divide it 

455
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,880
by 2 in any case, so we get 

456
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,660
another 2 times 21. 249 

457
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,000
is another 2, so that's 

458
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,660
another prime number. And 

459
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,100
we have to think about 21 for a moment, it 

460
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,000
's not a prime number. That means we 

461
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,780
have to break down 21 even further, 

462
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,340
or 

463
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,180
find a divisor of it. The 21 has the 

464
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,120
divisor 3, because the sum of the digits 
of 21 

465
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,560
is 3. Consequently, the 

466
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,840
3 is divisible by 3, so 

467
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,340
the 21 also has the divisor 

468
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,780
3. We can therefore 

469
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,600
represent the 21 as 3 times 7. And if we 

470
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,740
now 

471
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,780
take a quick look at our result , 5 times 
2 times 2 times 3 times 7, 

472
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,040
these are all prime numbers, then 

473
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,560
we are almost at the end, 

474
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,280
or rather we have 

475
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,600
already successfully 

476
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,980
broken down our number into prime factors. 
The only thing we 

477
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,820
should do now is 

478
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,120
sort them in descending order of value. 

479
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,340
In other words, we start with the largest 

480
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,780
and then get smaller. 

481
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,960
You should always sort them like this. 

482
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,040
You'll see why in a moment. This means 420 

483
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,020
is equal to 7 times 5 times 3 times 2 
times 2 

484
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,780
and we have successfully 

485
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,440

486
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,200
carried out our prime factorization . 

487
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
This brings us to the topic of the 
greatest 

488
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,220
common divisor. The greatest 

489
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,240
common divisor of two numbers is 

490
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,200
the greatest number by which both 

491
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,800
numbers are divisible. You 

492
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,460
often need this if you 

493
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,900
want to reduce fractions , because you are 
looking for the 

494
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,000
greatest common divisor of the numerator 

495
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,560
and denominator and if you 

496
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,620
then 

497
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,080
divide the fraction by this greatest 
common divisor, which is the advantage of 

498
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,460
the greatest common divisor over 

499
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,980
other divisors, then you 

500
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,660
directly get the fraction that cannot 

501
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,580
be reduced any further, because it has 
already 

502
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,140

503
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,400
been reduced by the greatest common 
divisor yes that's why it 

504
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,980
always makes sense 

505
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,420
to look for the greatest common divisor 
because 

506
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,800
then you immediately get a fraction that 

507
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,800
can't be reduced any further and that's 
why 

508
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
we're going to 

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,080
deal with it now and we have two 

510
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
numbers here , 18 and 27, and we're 

511
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
looking for the greatest common divisor 

512
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,580
of both and the first thing to do 

513
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,780
, or for small numbers, 

514
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,120
is 

515
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
to write down the whole divisors the 
divisor 

516
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,920
of 18 is 1, 2, 

517
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,680
3, 6, 9 and 18. 

518
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,700
The divisor of 27 is 1, 3, 

519
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,900
9 and 27 and we 

520
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,480
now choose the largest number that 

521
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,780
is in both divisors. This means that 

522
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,140
if the numbers 

523
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,640
are reasonably close together, you can 

524
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,620
start on the right. But you can 

525
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,700
also just start on the left. 

526
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,140
It doesn't matter, it's just a matter of 

527
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,720
what's faster at the moment. 

528
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,860
Let's start on the right. 

529
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,000
We have 18 at 18, 27 at 27, 

530
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,300
then we have 9 at 18 and 

531
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,980
we also have 9 at 27. And 

532
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,340
that is now our largest 

533
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,620
common divisor. In other words, we 

534
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,800
can conclude by saying that the largest 

535
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,160
number contained in both sets 

536
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,020
is 9. This means that 9 is 

537
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,040
the largest common divisor of the 

538
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,640
two numbers. 

539
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,700
The problem is, sometimes it is... 

540
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,920
a little more difficult to 

541
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,520
determine the greatest common divisor 

542
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,180
and then you can also resort to 

543
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,860
prime factorization. 

544
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,180
To do this, however, you first have to 

545
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,980

546
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,520
carry out the prime factorization for both 
numbers. This means that we need to 

547
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,540

548
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,380
have written both numbers as prime factors 
and then 

549
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,740
we select all the factors 

550
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,000
that are common to both numbers. 

551
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,240
And that is why it is so important 

552
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,740

553
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,260
that we 

554
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,540
start with the largest number, otherwise 
it will be very 

555
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,120
difficult to compare, i.e. 

556
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,080
in this example we have 19 and 

557
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,620
135, we have already 

558
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,300
carried out the prime factorization 

559
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,860
, i.e. we can represent 90 

560
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,040
by 5 times 3 times 3 times 2 and 135 

561
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,460
by 5 times 3 times 3 times 3 and now 

562
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,080
we compare that we have 

563
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,660
both times 5 here, we 

564
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,240
have 3 here , we have both times 

565
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,780
3 again and now we have 

566
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,780
2 and 3 at once. In other words, 

567
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,540
the common factors or the 

568
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,840
common factor is 5 times 3 times 3, 

569
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,280
because that's what we have for both. 

570
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,260
This means that the greatest common 
divisor 

571
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,000
of the two numbers is 5 times 3 times 

572
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,740
3, i.e. 45. This is also how you can 

573
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,240
determine the greatest common divisor. 

574
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,360
Please note that this can also 

575
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,660
be written as a power. 

576
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,720
In other words, that would be 5 times 3 to 
the power of 2 times 2 

577
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,300
and that would be 5 times 3 to the power 
of 3. 

578
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,440
You just have to make sure that 5 times 3 

579
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,540
to the power of 2 is the common factor. 

580
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,340
And that would be 45 

581
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,140
, which brings us to the 

582
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,180
least common multiple. The 

583
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,020
least common multiple of two 

584
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,880
numbers is the smallest number that is a 

585
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,300
multiple of both numbers. The 

586
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,740
least common multiple is 

587
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,220
also often used in fractions 

588
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,440
. It is used when you 

589
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,740
want to make fractions equal. This is 

590
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,920
necessary if we 

591
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,120
want to add or subtract fractions . It is 
therefore 

592
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,800
important to 

593
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,340
be able to determine the least common 
multiple. 

594
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,820
Calculate or determine this by 

595
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,280

596
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,140
simply writing down the multiples of both 
numbers. In the 

597
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,160
example here, we have 4 and 6 and 

598
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,080
are now writing down the multiples 

599
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,980
of these numbers. Multiples of the 

600
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,480
4 are the 4, the 8, the 12, the 16, 

601
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,440
the 20 and the 24 and so on. 

602
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,420
There are an infinite number of multiples. 

603
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,740
Multiples of 6 are 6, 

604
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,140
12, 18 and 24 and 

605
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,920
many more numbers. We want the 

606
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,180
smallest common multiple. 

607
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,120
In other words, we now start on the left 
and 

608
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,560
look for the smallest number 

609
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,700
that is contained in both sets, 

610
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,640
i.e. we always compare whether 

611
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,020
we 

612
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,760
find the same number when we first have 48 

613
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,620
12 16 now we have 6 12 18 

614
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,880
we can already see here aha we have 

615
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,000
12 both times, i.e. 12 

616
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,500
is the smallest common number and 

617
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
therefore the smallest common 

618
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,400
multiple of 4 and 6 is 

619
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,700
12. 

620
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,500
We can't always determine it as we have 

621
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,860
just shown , because the numbers 

622
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,620
may be slightly larger, as 

623
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,220
here. And then there is also an 

624
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,900
alternative method. 

625
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,800
First, we carry out the 

626
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,420
prime factorization for both numbers 

627
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,000
again. Then we 

628
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,260

629
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,720
select the factors in their highest power. 
Important, we go into both 

630
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,520
. Then we multiply 

631
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,540
these factors. only out. 

632
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,420
This means that in this case we have the 

633
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,760
330 and the 324, which we have 

634
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,300
already 

635
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,420
broken down into the following factors 
using the prime factorization . The 11 

636
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,820
times 5 times 3 times 2 for the 330 and 3 

637
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,060
times 3 times 3 times 3 times 2 times 2 
for the 

638
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,680
324. That is 3 to the power of 4 times 2 
to the power of 2. 

639
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,800
We now select the factors in 

640
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,700
their highest power. This means 

641
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,380
that we start on the left again, which is 

642
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,440
why it is so 

643
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,100
important to sort them in 

644
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,460
descending order. 

645
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,240
The highest power is 11 to the power of 1, 

646
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,060
if you like. Then we have 5 

647
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,440
to the power of 1. Then we have 3. Here we 

648
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,240
have 3 to the power of 4. We take the 

649
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,160
highest power, so we take 3 

650
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,040
to the power of 4. Then we go on, 

651
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,660
we have a 2 here and here we also have 

652
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,540
2 to the power of 2. Here we also take the 

653
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,560
highest power, so 2 to the power of 2. The 

654
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,580
least common multiple is 

655
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,840
then 11 times 5 times 3 to the power of 4 
times 2 to the power of 

656
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,800
2 and that is then 17,820. So 

657
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,940
we can say that the least 

658
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,180
common multiple of 330 and 324 

659
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,720
is 17,820. And that brings us to 

660
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,680
the end of the webinar. 

661
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,180
Thank you very much for your 

662
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,920
attention.
