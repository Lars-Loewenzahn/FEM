00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,180
Hello, my name is Nick and I am a 

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,700
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,940
Today I would like to explain to you 
something about 

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,880
material cycling ecosystems with 

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,300
a focus on the food chain. 

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,560
When it comes to sustainability and 

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,240
environmental protection, 

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,680
our diet plays a particularly important 
role. 

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,080
Eating a lot of meat can not only 

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,040
be healthy, it is also 

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,040

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,960
problematic from an agricultural point of 
view, as it is 

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,900
more energy-intensive to produce animal 
products 

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,220
than plant products. 

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,860
This means that more land, 

16
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,060
water etc. is required to produce the same 

17
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,340
amount of nutrients. In addition to 

18
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,240
Germany, there are many other 

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,600
countries that have 

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,100
achieved a certain level of 

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,020
prosperity as a result of globalization 
and where 

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,520
the diet of the affluent 

23
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,980
sections of the population is becoming 
increasingly 

24
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,020
meat-based. Why this 

25
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,320
change 

26
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,200
can be critical from an ecological point 
of view becomes particularly 

27
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,380
clear when we take a closer look at 

28
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,940
food chains. The path 

29
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,540
from nutrients from forage plants 

30
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,640
to animals to humans can 

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,220
be depicted in food pyramids. 

32
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,060
The four levels of the food pyramid 

33
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,800
are producer-producer, 

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,560
primary consumer, secondary consumer and 

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,880
final consumer. The individual levels 

36
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,180
of the food pyramids 

37
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,320
build on each other. The lowest level 

38
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,600
is formed by primary producers, 

39
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,540
i.e. mostly plants. This is followed by 
the 

40
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,980
primary consumers, i.e. 

41
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,380
herbivores, the 

42
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,380
secondary consumers and finally the 

43
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,280
final consumers, both carnivores. 

44
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,800
Substances can 

45
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,960
migrate upwards through these pyramids . 
This changes 

46
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,780
the biomass, i.e. the amount of 

47
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,300
food in the form of plants or 

48
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,380
animals, the energy 

49
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,600
contained in the food and the number of 
individuals. The 

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,420
biomass and number of individuals 

51
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,180
decrease the higher up the pyramid you 

52
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,320
go. This means that there are many 

53
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,040
more plants than herbivores and 

54
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,360
many more herbivores than 

55
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,400
carnivores. This energy also 

56
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,360

57
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,220
decreases by up to 90% for each level 
passed. This is because cattle 

58
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,460
, for example, need a large proportion of 
the 

59
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,900
energy from their feed for 

60
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,960
their own metabolism. Only 10-35% of the 

61
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,540
energy from the feed goes 

62
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,980
into the meat that we can eat. 

63
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,780
So if we humans were to 

64
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,060
consume the plant-based feed 

65
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,560
, more people could 

66
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,780
be supplied with it. A special 

67
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,540
level of the food chain, which 

68
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,940

69
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,420
is mainly overlooked due to the size of 
the animals, 

70
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,520
is formed by the destructors. Destruents 

71
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,940
are organisms that convert organic 

72
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,320
compounds into inorganic 

73
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,240
compounds. Examples include 

74
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,440
woodlice, flies, 

75
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,080
earthworms, beetles, bacteria and 

76
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,960
fungi. The name destruents means 

77
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,580
destroyers or decomposers, as they 

78
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,360

79
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,660

80
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,500
convert organic substances , i.e. 
substances that are easily usable by other 
living organisms , into inorganic 
substances, i.e. 

81
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
substances that 

82
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,520
are of little use to other living 
organisms as food. The concept 

83
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
of food chains sounds 

84
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,640
simple at first. 

85
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
However, the reality is much 

86
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,500
more complex. Food chains are 

87
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,280
linear. They assume that 

88
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,240
each species 

89
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,200
occupies a position in the food chain. 

90
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,780

91
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,720
However, if we take a closer look at 
carnivores in particular , it becomes 
clear that 

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,760
such a classification 

93
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,760
can only describe reality to a limited 
extent. 

94
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,660
Crocodiles , for example, eat both 
herbivores 

95
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,500
and carnivores. In order to 

96
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,100

97
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,660
obtain a realistic representation of 
energy cycles, 

98
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,600
a food web is thus created in 

99
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,580
which one species can also be part of 
several 

100
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,160
food chains and several 

101
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,720
food chains 

102
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,380
are part of a large food web. It is 
precisely this 

103
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,080
complexity that means that the 

104
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,100
loss of a species from one of the 

105
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,560
levels 

106
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,380
can lead to unforeseeable consequences. 

107
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,780
The following are examples of 

108
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,400
how the 

109
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,080
loss of one species 

110
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,800
can affect the entire ecosystem. 

111
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,220
Herbivores form the basis of the 

112
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,440
food chain. A 

113
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,660
few species are often common, while others 
are rare. 

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,240
If one of the common species dies, there 
are 

115
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,820
no more resources available for the 

116
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,720
carnivores. 

117
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,160
There is also the possibility that the 

118
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,260
carnivores will then 

119
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,160
hunt rarer herbivores and 

120
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
thus wipe out their species. 

121
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,980
Carnivores 

122
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,520
play an important role in the regulation 
of 

123
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,220
herbivores 

124
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,320
Bears became 

125
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,220
so abundant that wild boar and deer 

126
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,800
now 

127
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,660
have to be hunted by us humans. If a 

128
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,760
destruent disappears , biological 
substances are 

129
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,660
no longer broken down. If you 

130
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,880

131
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,780
visit the island mountain Uluru in 
Australia , you will notice the effects 

132
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,920
of this. In Australia, there 

133
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,500
are no dung beetles 

134
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,080

135
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,700
to decompose the remains of cows and 
sheep. As a result, 

136
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,120
you will be 

137
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,920
able to build on every step. So why is it 

138
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,660
biologically questionable if 

139
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,020
more and more people are at the top of the 

140
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,540
food chain? The 

141
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,560
energy content and biomass 

142
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,300
decrease by up to 90% from step to step. 
In 

143
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,100
practice, this means that 

144
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,980
up to 100 kg 

145
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,100
of plant material is needed for 10 kg of 
meat . In reality, 

146
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,840
the resources required 

147
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,360
for meat production are significantly 
higher. 

148
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,440
In addition to plants, 

149
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,000
clean water, space and 

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
medicines are also needed to raise 

151
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,020
cattle for slaughter. The more 

152
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,540
people eat meat, the 

153
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,360
more arable land is 

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,220
needed for animal feed. 

155
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,440
Forests are cleared and ecosystems 

156
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,320
destroyed. However, the problem is not 

157
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,220
meat consumption per se, but 

158
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,500
that the number of people in the world 

159
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,560

160
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,960
has increased so much in recent centuries 
that we 

161
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,280

162
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,760

163
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:13,980

164
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,820

165
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
have to share natural resources such as 
food and water more intelligently , have 
ecosystems and especially food chains. 
Glad you could 

166
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,340
join us and see you next 

167
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,560
time.
