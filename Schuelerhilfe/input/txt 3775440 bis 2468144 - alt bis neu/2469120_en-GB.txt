00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,120
Hello, my name is Paula and I 

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,560
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,680
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,440
explain to you 

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,740
what carboxylic acid and the 

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,920
carboxyl group are all about in chemistry. 

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,760
In our online learning center, you can 

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,320
of course also find a 

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,420
wiki on this topic , in which the 

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,980
basic and important terms 

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,400
are explained in more detail. Without 
realizing it 

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,560
, we encounter carboxylic acids 

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,860
very often in everyday life, for example 
in the form 

14
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,560
of acetic acid for removing 

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,160
lime. Or as part of our food. 

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,700
Fatty acids, lactic acid, citric acid 

17
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,100
or malic acid. 

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,640

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,240
They are also responsible for the 
unpleasant smell of sweat. Carboxylic 
acids are 

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,020
part of organic chemistry. Their 

21
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,800
main bodies are therefore made up of 

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,380
carbon and hydrogen. 

23
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,760
When describing the molecules 

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,540
, familiar 

25
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,840
terms such as chain structure, 

26
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,940
ring structure, saturated and 

27
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,020
unsaturated compounds and 

28
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,480
monocarboxylic or tricarboxylic acids are 
used. But 

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
what exactly distinguishes a 

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,380
carboxylic acid from pure 

31
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,580
hydrocarbons? Carboxylic acids 

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,840
have at least one carboxyl group. 

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,180
The carboxyl group is a 

34
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,680
functional group with the 

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,800
molecular formula COOH. 

36
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,140
In the nomenclature, the naming 

37
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,680
is based on the respective 

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,440
hydrocarbon on which the 

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,280
carboxylic acid is based. Accordingly, 

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,060
methane becomes methanoic acid, propene 

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,100
becomes propanoic acid and butyne becomes 

42
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,900
butyric acid. The structure of the 

43
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,760
carboxyl group has a 

44
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,300

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,360
considerable influence on the chemical 
properties of the carboxylic acid. 

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
To illustrate this, let's take a look at a 

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
comparison between propane, propanol 

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,880
and propanoic acid. Propane and 

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,440
propanol differ in their 

50
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,340
structure by an additional 

51
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,200
oxygen atom due to the 

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
hydroxyl group of the alcohol. 

53
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,540
Propanoic acid has another 

54
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,720
additional oxygen atom, 

55
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,660
but loses two hydrogen atoms. 

56
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,200
This results in 

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,640
differences in molecular weight of 16 
grams per mole and 

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,320
14 grams per mole. The molar masses 

59
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
are therefore quite close 

60
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,720
to each other. 

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,540
There are greater differences in the 
melting point. For example, 

62
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,400
the melting point 

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,780
increases by 62°C from propane to 
propanol. From propanol to 

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,040
propanoic acid, the increase is as high as 

65
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,740
105°C. At the boiling point, there is 

66
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,460
first a jump of 139°C and then 

67
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,340
a small step of 44.2°C. 

68
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,040
The reason for these large differences 

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
compared to propane is the 

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,620
possibility of 

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,360

72
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520

73
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,260
forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds due 
to the functional groups. Finally, a 

74
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,480
comparison of the PKS values. The PKS 
value 

75
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,000
is the negative decadic 

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,780
logarithm of the acid constant. 

77
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,520
Therefore, the lower the value, 

78
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,260
the stronger the acid. In words, 

79
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,180
the figures mean that propanoic acid 

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,240

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,340
is at least categorized as a 
medium-strength acid . The reason for this 
is 

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,760
that, thanks to the oxygen 

83
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,420
 double bond, the formation of electrons 

84
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,920
in the hydroxyl group is polarized and 

85
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,500
the proton can dissolve more easily. 

86
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,940
Let me summarize the most important points 
for you 

87
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,640
once again. Carboxylic acids 

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,280
are hydrocarbons with 

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,260
at least one carboxyl group. The 

90
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,220
name is based on the 

91
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,600
corresponding hydrocarbon. 

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,860
Due to the carboxyl group, carboxylic 

93
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,560
acids have higher melting and 

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,220
boiling points than comparable 

95
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,900
molecules as well as a higher acidity. 

96
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,360
I hope I 

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,060
have been able to help you 

98
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,760
better understand carboxylic acids and the 
carboxyl group. 

99
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,080
