Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,400
analytic geometry positional relationship 

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,900
part 1. In this 

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,540
webinar we will 

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,460

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,060

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,920
look at the positional relationship from a 
point to a degree as well as the 
positional relationship between two 
degrees . First, we will start with the 

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,300
positional relationship between a point 

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,480
and a degree. 

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,640

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,160
There are exactly two 

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
cases for the positional relationship 
between a point and a degree . One case is 
that the 

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,520
point is part of the degree, i.e. 

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,000
the point lies on the degree. And 

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,260
the second case is that the point 

16
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,760
is not part of the line. This means that 

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,920
the point is not on the 

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,300
straight line and is outside it and has 

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,240
a certain distance. This can 

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,080
also be calculated, 

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,340
but we won 't be doing that in this 
webinar. 

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,260
The solution method or the approach 

23
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,300
to such a problem is that we 

24
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,460
carry out a point test. This means that we 

25
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,820

26
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,640

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,580

28
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,440
equate the position vector of the point, 
i.e. simply write the point as a vector , 
with the parameter form of the linear 
equation and 

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,260
solve the resulting 

30
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,420
system of equations. The small problem 

31
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,740
that arises is that we have 

32
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,780
a system of equations with three 

33
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,300
equations, but only one variable, 

34
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,640
i.e. it is overdetermined. And 

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
so we have to 

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,760
determine the solutions to all three 
equations, 

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,320
or 

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,140
determine the solutions from all three 
equations , and then 

39
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,620
see whether we 

40
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,520
have a uniform solution at the end. Yes, 
this means that our 

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,760
variable must 

42
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,140
have the same value for each equation . 
We'll see that 

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,020
in a moment. We' 

44
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,120
ll have an example of 

45
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,400
both cases later on. This means that if 
the 

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,580
point lies on the straight line, we have 

47
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,100
a unique solution. So 

48
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,020
all three equations 

49
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,400
have the same solution. The other case is 

50
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,200
that we do not 

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
have a unique solution. This means that we 
have 

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
different solutions. So from 

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,720
one equation, the result is that lambda 

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,240
is equal to 2. 2 From the other equation 

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,520
, the result is that lambda is equal to 3. 
And that 

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,120
is then quite clear, the point 

57
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,410
does not lie on the trench. We 

58
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,290
also have an example of this here, as 

59
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,810
just mentioned. On the left, we see 

60
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,330
the case where the point 

61
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,330
is part of the straight line. On the 
right, we see the 

62
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,710
case where the point is not part of the 

63
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,730
line. We have specified the 

64
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,390
point P above. And 

65
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,350
we 

66
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,890
equate this point P with the equation of 
the line G . the equation of the line g 

67
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,990
in this case is 0 31 plus subject 1 

68
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,510
minus 2 minus 1, i.e. we 

69
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,990
now 

70
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,610

71
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,270
equate the point in the vector formula 
with the equation of the line , i.e. 112 
equals 

72
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,090
0 31 plus subject 1 2 1 and the form 

73
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,970
becomes a lgs, i.e. we 

74
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,070
simply see this line by line, i.e. 1 

75
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,630
equals 0 plus 1t, 1 equals 3 

76
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,110
minus 2t and 2 equals 1 plus t. 

77
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,750
And now we calculate 

78
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,670
the solution 

79
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,950
for t for each of these three equations . 
We do this here, as 

80
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,530
I said, because we only 

81
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,750
have one unknown , so we 

82
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,450
get a solution from each equation. And 

83
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,150
in this case, we see 

84
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,230
that the solution t is 

85
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,950
equal to 1 for all three equations 

86
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,550

87
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,250
, which means that we have a uniform 
solution 

88
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,370
. Here on the right 

89
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,470
we see another case, which 

90
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,750
has already been worked out a little 

91
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,590
, which means we have 

92
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,790

93
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,090
equated a point with the same equation of 
the line, i.e. 

94
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,310
this is now the point 2-1-0 and 

95
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,130
we have already equated it and 

96
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,010

97
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,850
formed the system of equations directly 
from it , i.e. 2 minus 1, 0 is equal to 

98
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,050
0, 3, 1 plus t times 1 minus 2, 1. 

99
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,330
This results in the system of equations 2 

100
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,010
is equal to 0 plus t or 0 plus 1t 

101
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,970
and minus 1 is equal to 3 minus 2t, 0 

102
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,430
is equal to 1 plus 1t. If we 

103
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,970
now transform this to t, 

104
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,310
the first equation results in t is equal 

105
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,990
to 2. The second equation 

106
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,010
also results in t is equal to 2, but 

107
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,430
the third equation results in t is 

108
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,550
equal to minus 1. And now we have 

109
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,930
the two-neck solution twice, but 

110
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,210
unfortunately the minus 1 once. 
Consequently, 

111
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,930
the point is not on the 

112
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,450
straight line. And that solves 

113
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,110
the problem. 

114
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,960
This brings us to the 

115
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,680
positional relationship between two 
straight lines. 

116
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,000

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,780
There are a total of four 

118
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,560
possibilities for the positional 
relationship between two straight lines . 
We are now 

119
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,180
really only talking about the 

120
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,560
three-dimensional. If you are in 

121
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,520
two dimensions, 

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,840
the fourth possibility, wind rails 

123
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,900
, does not exist . Vector calculation 

124
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,400
actually only takes place in 

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,700
three dimensions. Therefore, there are 

126
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,540
four possibilities. 

127
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,660
The first is, as we all know, 

128
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,060
parallel. The second is identical. 

129
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,320
The difference between parallel and 

130
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,780
identical is when two parallel 

131
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,080
degrees have the same 

132
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,200
orientation, i.e. the same 

133
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,760
direction. Two identical degrees 

134
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,600
also have the same direction, 

135
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,240
but they are really inside each other. 

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
This means that they have an infinite 

137
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,980
number of common points, whereas 

138
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,880
parallel degrees have no common 

139
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,840
points. Then there is the 

140
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
classic point of intersection, 

141
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,920
which means that they really do have a 
point of intersection 

142
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,380
and then there is the case, which as 

143
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,700
I said only exists in three dimensions, 

144
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,340
that the degrees are skewed. 

145
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,560
Skewed means that they are not 

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,880
parallel, but they also have no 

147
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,980
intersection point because they do not 
intersect 

148
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,300
. As I said, this is only possible in 

149
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,260
three 

150
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,440
dimensions, because you need the third 
dimension for this. 

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
In principle, you can imagine it like this 

152
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
: you stretch 

153
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
a thread on the ceiling and on the floor. 
These 

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,760
are not parallel to each other if 

155
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,700
you stretch them correctly, but they 

156
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,860
will never intersect. 

157
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,200
Well, how can you test the whole thing? 

158
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,340
When you 

159
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,020
examine the bearing relationship between 
two straight lines, you 

160
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,100
always have two steps. The first 

161
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
step is always to check the 

162
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,920
direction vectors. 

163
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
In other words, you check whether the 

164
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,460
direction vectors 

165
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,020
are linearly dependent. This means whether 
they 

166
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
are multiples of each other. This 

167
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,200
clarifies whether the two degrees 

168
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,540
have the same direction. And it is 

169
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,480
probably noticeable that parallel 

170
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,600
and identical degrees have the 

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,340
same direction. If the degrees 

172
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,300
have a point of intersection or 

173
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,860
are skewed, they 

174
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,740
do not. This means that if we 

175
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,940

176
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,180

177
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,960
have checked our direction vector or 
direction vectors for linear dependence 
and this 

178
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,600
is positive, then we either have 

179
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,200
two parallel lines or two 

180
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,080
identical lines. To 

181
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,940
continue, the next step is to 

182
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,440
carry out the point test. In other words 

183
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,080
, we check whether the support vector of 

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
one line 

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
is part of the other line. If this is the 
case, 

186
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,940
they are identical. So if the 

187
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,120
point test is successful, the 

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
lines are identical. 

189
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
If the dot test is not successful, 

190
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,910
they are parallel. If the 

191
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,510
direction vectors 

192
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,730
are not linearly dependent, then we are 
here, 

193
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,630
then we have an intersection point 

194
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,090
or two skew lines. 

195
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,850
The next step is to go and check 

196
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,950
for an intersection. So you 

197
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,050
set the two lines G1 and G2 

198
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,040
equal. Equal. We then get a 

199
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,980
linear system of equations and if 

200
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,660
this has a unique solution, then 

201
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,980
we have an intersection point. Then 

202
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,860
you can also determine the point of 
intersection 

203
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,440
. Let's do that straight away 

204
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,520
. If this 

205
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,760
system of linear equations has no 
solution, 

206
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,920
the lines are skewed 

207
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,160
and therefore have no 

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
point of intersection . 

209
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,730
As already mentioned, 

210
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,870
we now have a few 

211
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,470
exercises to 

212
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,590
illustrate the whole thing. 

213
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,490
First of all, we have the case here, 

214
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,370
i.e. left and right are two 

215
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,350
different calculations. Below is the 

216
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,070
case where 

217
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,750
the lines are identical on the left and 

218
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,210
parallel on the right. Of course, we are 

219
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,590
also looking at different straight lines. 
So 

220
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,070
let's start with the left side. 

221
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,490
Here we have g1 equals x-vector 

222
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,130
equals 0, 1, 2 plus r times 1, 2, 

223
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,990
minus 3. and the second 

224
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,310
equation of the line is 2.5, minus 4 

225
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,810
plus t times minus 2, minus 4, 6 and 

226
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,910
the first thing we do, of course, is to 
check whether 

227
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,570
the two direction vectors 

228
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,630
are linearly dependent. In other words, we 
check 

229
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,090
whether they are multiples of each other. 

230
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,250
Then we simply look at whether 1 and minus 

231
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,950
2 is the factor minus 2, 2 and minus 

232
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,290
4 is the factor minus 3 and 6 is also 

233
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,390
the factor minus 2. In other words 

234
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,630
, they are linearly dependent 

235
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,230
or the direction vectors 

236
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,870
are multiples of each other. Consequently, 

237
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,710
the two degrees are either 

238
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,270
parallel or identical. Therefore, 

239
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,370
the next step is to check the 

240
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,990
support vector of the other degrees 

241
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,070
to see if it is part of the degrees. 

242
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,770
Therefore, we now take the 

243
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,270
support vector of G2 and use 

244
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,090
it to perform the dot test on G1. So 

245
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,250
we take the support vector here 

246
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,670
and check whether it 

247
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,130
lies on this equation of the line. This 
brings us 

248
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,030
to the equation 2, 5, minus 4 is 

249
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,710
equal to 0, 1, 2 plus R times 1, 2, minus 

250
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,850
3. As I said, this is a very 

251
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,210
simple point test, as we 

252
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,490
have already demonstrated earlier. You 
will notice that 

253
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,510

254
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,190
R equals 2 in all three equations. 

255
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,850
So we have a uniform 

256
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,230
solution. Consequently, the point is part 

257
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,150
of the straight line and therefore the 

258
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,990
straight lines are identical. Here on the 
right, 

259
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,570
as I said, we have the other example 

260
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,090
. We also have two 

261
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,270
straight line equations. One 

262
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,990
is 0, 1, 2 plus R times 1, 1, 3 

263
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,970
and the second is 4, 0, 0 plus T 

264
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,530
times 3, 3, 9. Here, too, we 

265
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,430
first check whether the 

266
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,930
direction vectors 

267
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,710
are linearly dependent. 1 and 3 is the 
factor 3. 1 and 

268
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,030
3 is again the factor 3. 3 and 9, 

269
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,790
that would be the factor 3 in between. 

270
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,230
This means that yes, the direction vectors 
are 

271
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,970
definitely linearly 

272
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,130
dependent on each other, i.e. multiples. 
Consequently, 

273
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,630
the straight lines are also parallel 

274
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,550
or identical here. This is why the 

275
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,190
approach is now 

276
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,530
equivalent to what we 

277
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,650
did on the left. This means that we 

278
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,830
now 

279
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,250
equate the support vector with the other 
line and 

280
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,010
check whether it is part of the line. 

281
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,890
Therefore, we take the support vector 

282
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,710
of G2, 4, 0, 0 and check whether it 

283
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,210
is part of the straight line G1. This 
brings us 

284
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,370
to the equation 4, 0, 0 is 

285
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,610
equal to 0, 1, 2 plus R times 1, 1, 3. 

286
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,150
If we 

287
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,570

288
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,830
carry out this point test, which is again 
a point test, we will find 

289
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,150
that we 

290
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,850
get different values for R. So from the 
first 

291
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,330
equation we get that R is equal to 

292
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,430
4. From the second equation 

293
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,790
we get that R is equal to minus 1. And 
from 

294
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,410
the third equation we get that R 

295
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,830
is equal to minus 2 thirds. And that 

296
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,210
is not a uniform solution. 

297
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,350
Consequently, the point does not lie on 

298
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,150
the line and therefore the 

299
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,730
lines are only parallel. And this 

300
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,250

301
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,730
also determines the positional 
relationship between these two lines. 

302
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,150
Let's move on to the 

303
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,010
more complex cases. This means 

304
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,530
that the lines 

305
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,750
are either skewed or have an intersection 
point. 

306
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,070
Here, too, we see 

307
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,450
our two straight lines at the top left. 

308
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,870
Our first straight line is G1 0,1 

309
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,250
,2 plus R times 1,1,2 and our 

310
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,830
straight line is equal to 2, 3, 0,0 plus T 

311
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,830
times minus 1, 1,2. Again, 

312
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,710
the first step is to 

313
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,630
check the linear dependency. So how do 

314
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,150
I get from 1 to minus 1? 1 is times 

315
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,990
minus 1. Here from 1 to 1, that 

316
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,290
would actually be a 1. And 

317
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,390
you can already see that there is not the 
same 

318
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,970
factor. Consequently, 

319
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,270
when checking the linear 

320
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,070
dependency , we realize that the two 

321
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,690
direction vectors 

322
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,330
are not linearly dependent, i.e. they 

323
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,870
are not multiples . And so we check 
directly for 

324
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,330
an intersection point. When checking for 

325
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,170
an intersection point , we set 

326
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,470
the complete straight lines to be equal 

327
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,610
and the same. This means that G1 is equal 
to 

328
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,990
G2. This gives us 012 plus R times 

329
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,290
112, which is equal to 300 plus T times 

330
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,250
minus 112. 

331
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,310
We 

332
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,090
now have to solve this system of equations 
. However, you realize that 

333
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,090
if you 

334
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,290

335
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,710
examine the intersection of two straight 
lines , you always have 

336
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,990
three equations and two unknowns. 

337
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,550
This means that it is still an 

338
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,370
overdetermined system of equations 

339
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,330
. Let's just take 

340
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,710
two equations as they arise here and solve 

341
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,610
them. However, it is still 

342
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,170
advisable to 

343
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,910
rearrange it completely so that you 

344
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,550

345
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,150
have the two variables, i.e. the two 
parameters on one side and the 

346
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,710
corresponding vector. Therefore, 

347
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,850
in the first step, we calculate minus 0, 
1, 2 

348
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,150
so that the support vector is removed here 

349
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,350
and minus t times minus 1, 1, 2 so that 

350
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,790
the direction vector t 

351
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,070
is added to the page. Then we have our two 

352
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,090
parameters r and t on the left and our 

353
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,530
vector on the right. This gives us r 

354
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,950
times 1, 1, 2 minus t times minus 1, 1, 2 

355
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,570
and that is equal to 3, 0, 0 minus 0, 

356
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,550
1, 2. Very important, please be 

357
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,690
careful with the signs when you 

358
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,330
factor this out. This gives us r times 

359
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,250
1, i.e. r minus t times minus 1, 

360
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,490
which is minus minus plus t. 3 minus 0 

361
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,190
is a 3rd line, r times 1 

362
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,790
minus t times 1, which is simply 1r 

363
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,090
minus 1t and that is equal to 0 minus 

364
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,590
1, i.e. minus 1. The last line, r 

365
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,330
times 2 minus t times 2, is 2r 

366
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,230
minus 2t and 0 minus 2 is also a 

367
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,250
simple minus 2. And so we 

368
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,710
now have our system of equations and 

369
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,810
we simply 

370
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,010
take out two of the three equations here 
to 

371
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,610
solve the system of equations. 

372
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,610
So we solve the whole thing as a 2x2 

373
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,770
system of equations. We decided 

374
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,030
to use the first two equations 

375
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,730
and came up with the 

376
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,810
solution R equals 1 and T equals 2. 

377
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,060
Once you have reached this point and 

378
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,840
determined the values of the two 
parameters 

379
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
, you are still a long way from reaching 
your 

380
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,860
goal. You absolutely have to 

381
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,280
do the test with the remaining equation. 

382
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,160
In other words, take the third 

383
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
equation that you have not yet 

384
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,360
worked with and do the test. 

385
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,680
In other words, you 

386
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,220
insert your R and your T. In our case, 
this is equation 

387
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,720
3. With equations 1 and 2, the two 

388
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,800
above, we have solved the 

389
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,920
system of equations. And 

390
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,200
equation 3 below is the 

391
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,900
remaining equation, which we will use at 
the end of the 

392
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,660
test. This is where 

393
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,180
we finally decide 

394
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,380
whether the lines are skewed or 

395
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,920
have a point of intersection. And that is 
2r 

396
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,040
-2t is equal to minus 2, we know r 

397
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,880
is equal to 1 and t is equal to 2, so 

398
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,780
2 times 1 minus 2 times 2 is equal to 

399
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,660
minus 2. 2 times 1 is 2, minus 2 times 2 

400
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,340
is minus 4 and 2 minus 4 is minus 

401
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,300
2. So this is a true statement, 

402
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,220
which arises here below. Consequently, 

403
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,860
the straight lines really do have an 

404
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,240
intersection point. And whenever you 

405
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,720
have an intersection point 

406
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,600
, you also calculate it. This means 

407
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,320
that we now have to insert the r into the 

408
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
equation of the line 1 or the 

409
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,220
t into the equation of the line 2. 

410
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,740

411
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,420
It doesn't matter which of the two 
parameters you insert. The only important 
thing is to 

412
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,560
always insert the parameters into the 
correct 

413
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,380
linear equation. So r in g1 

414
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,220
in this case or t in g2. We have 

415
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,100
decided to use r in g1 

416
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,460
. We therefore calculate 

417
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,680
0, 1, 2 plus 1, 1, 2. 

418
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,160
2, i.e. 1, is simply here because 

419
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,040
r is equal to 1. We have 

420
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,920
inserted that. And this is how we 
determine the 

421
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,140
intersection point. So 0 plus 1 times 1 is 

422
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,640
1. 1 plus 1 times 1 is 1 plus 1, 

423
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,220
or 2. And 2 plus 1 times 2 

424
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,000
is 2 plus 2, or 4. The 

425
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,140
intersection point is then 1, 2, 4. And 

426
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,100
that 

427
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,420
solves the problem. This brings us 

428
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,040
to the last case, which, if 

429
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,580
you've been paying attention, is the 
skewed 

430
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,840
case. Once again, we have 

431
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,480
two degree equations, as we need them 

432
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,760
for this. The first 

433
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,380
equation of degree is 012 plus r times 

434
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,600
112. The second equation of degree 

435
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,380
is 611 plus t times minus 112. These 

436
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,680
are our two equations of degree 

437
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,320
and, of course, we start at the beginning 

438
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,120
. This means that we 

439
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,040
first check whether the two 

440
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,240
direction vectors 

441
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,160
are linearly dependent , i.e. 

442
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,520
find the two direction vectors once 

443
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,480
and see if they are multiples to 

444
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,160
get from 1 minus 1 

445
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,360
we have to 

446
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,400
multiply again by times minus 1 and to 

447
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,460
get from 1 to 1 we have to take the 1 
there 

448
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,920
you can already see minus 1 and 1 here 

449
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,200
below we also have the 1 as a 

450
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,440
factor again , so it is not a constant 

451
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,120
factor that is 

452
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,140
different from element to element , so the 

453
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,260
direction vectors And are not 

454
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,920
multiples, so we now check 

455
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,140
again for an intersection point. Because 

456
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,680
we either have an intersection point 

457
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,040
or the lines are 

458
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,940
skewed. 

459
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,280
When checking for an intersection 

460
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,420
, we do what we just did, 

461
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,700
the approach. So G1 equals G2, so 

462
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,180
we get 012 plus R times 112 

463
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,760
equals 611 plus T times minus 112. 

464
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,800
Again, we want to 

465
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,220
collect our parameters on the left and 

466
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,360
our vector on the right. 

467
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,400
We therefore calculate minus 0.12 

468
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,740
so that the vector comes across and minus 

469
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,940
t times minus 1.12 so that the t vector 

470
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,660
comes across. This gives us r times 1 

471
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,260
.12 minus t times minus 1.12. This is 

472
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,580
equal to 6.1.1 minus 0.12. 

473
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,320
And from this we now form our 

474
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,460
system of equations. 

475
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,060
Again , please note that it is minus t. 

476
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,520
This means that if we 

477
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,900
determine the first line , we have r times 
1 minus t 

478
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,960
times minus 1, which is plus t, so 1r 

479
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,180
plus 1t is equal to 6 minus 0, i.e. 6. 

480
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
The second line r times 1 minus t times 

481
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,960
1, which is 1r minus 1t and that is 

482
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,120
equal to 1 minus 1 or 0. 

483
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,680
The last line r times 2 minus t times 

484
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,400
2 equals 1 minus 2, so we arrive 

485
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,580
at 2r minus 2t. equals minus 1. If 

486
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,880
we solve this system of equations, 

487
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,880
we go back here 

488
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,300
and take two of the three 

489
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,900
equations and solve 

490
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,660
the 

491
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,900
system of equations with these two 
equations , simply for the 

492
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,920
same reason as before. We have 

493
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,080
three equations, but only two 

494
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,140
unknown ones, so the 

495
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,300
system of equations is overdetermined and 

496
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,500
therefore we only take 

497
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,040
as many equations as we 

498
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,460
need to determine it. A 

499
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,600
system of equations is always 

500
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,020
determined if you 

501
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,620
have as many unknowns as equations. 

502
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,540
That's why we've taken the 

503
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,880
top two equations here, 

504
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,880

505
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,340
worked out our r and our t , in which case 
r is 

506
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,740
equal to 3 and t is equal to 3, and we'll 
do 

507
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,560

508
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,880

509
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,100
the test with the last equation , which in 
this case is equation 3 below. So 2r is 
equal to, 

510
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,680
sorry, 2r minus 2t is 

511
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,900
equal to minus 1, that's the 

512
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,040
equation. We put our R 

513
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
and T in there , so we get 2 times 3 

514
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,960
minus 2 times 3 and unfortunately that is 

515
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,900
equal to 0 and not equal to minus 2. 

516
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
Consequently, we get a false 

517
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,780
statement, so a false statement 

518
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,380
and therefore the lines are 

519
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,600
skewed. So whenever the 

520
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,240
test results in a false statement at the 
end 

521
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,640
, the straight lines are 

522
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,980
skewed. That brings us to 

523
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,400
the end of the webinar. 

524
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,960
Thank you very much for your 

525
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,720
attention.
