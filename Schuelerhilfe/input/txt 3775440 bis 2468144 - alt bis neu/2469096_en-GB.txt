00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, my name is Nick and I am a 

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,360
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,880
Today I would like to give you an insight 
into 

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,840
the topic of atoms, molecules and ions 

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,080
. 

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,740

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,960
Of course, you can also find more content 
on these and many other topics in our 
online 

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,820
 learning center. Atoms are in principle 

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,320
the smallest unit of matter, 

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,240
but consist of subatomic, i.e. 

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,320
even smaller particles. The 

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,480
nucleus-shell model describes the atomic 
nucleus and 

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,100
shell. The atomic nucleus consists of an 

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,080
equal number of positively charged 

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,020
protons and neutrally charged 

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,360
neutrons. The shell, on the other hand, 

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,780
consists of negatively charged electrons. 
The 

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,280
nucleus and the shell neutralize 

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,600
each other. The helium atom, 

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,120
for example, consists of two 

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,220
protons and two neutrons in the nucleus 
and 

22
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,900
two electrons in the shell. Did 

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,680
you know that the word atom comes from the 

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,800
ancient Greek atomos and 

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,920
means indivisible? Elements, the 

26
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,400
building blocks of all matter, are 

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,340
either atomic and consist of only 

28
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,640
one particle, such as sodium, or 

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,280
molecular and consist of two 

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,580
particles, such as oxygen. 

31
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,380
Atoms 

32
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,880
of different elements can also be combined 
to form molecules . 

33
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,680
One of the best-known molecules 

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,080
is H2O, which we know as water. 

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
It is a compound of one 

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,680
oxygen and two 

37
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,740
hydrogen atoms. Atoms 

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,360
combine to form molecules by 

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,180

40
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,500

41
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,120

42
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,200
sharing their outer electrons in a 
so-called electron bond, also known as an 
atomic bond. Molecules are generally 

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,320
more energetically favorable, which is why 
all 

44
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,560
elements except noble gases 

45
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,860
strive to form compounds. Ions are 

46
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,280
charged atoms. By 

47
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,340
donating electrons they either become 

48
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,760
positively charged and are called 

49
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,440
cations or by accepting electrons 

50
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,160
they become negatively charged and 

51
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,680
are called anions. Sodium chloride 

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,260
, or common salt as you probably know it, 

53
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,020
consists of a sodium cation and 

54
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,080
a chloride anion. The positive 

55
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,980
charge of the sodium cation and the 

56
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,540
negative charge of the chloride anion 

57
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,440
attract each other like magnets and 

58
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
form a salt crystal. This type 

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,020
of bond is called an ionic bond. 

60
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,920
In contrast to 

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,380
electron pair bonds, which share 

62
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,440
their electrons, ionic bonds 

63
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,960
work by one partner 

64
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560

65
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,820
attracting the electrons of the other 
partner . What both types of bond 

66
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,560
have in common, however, is the 

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,260
desire to fulfill the octet rule, 

68
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,880
i.e. the desire for 8 

69
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
outer electrons in order to be stable. 

70
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,600
You know that mineral water 

71
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,160
tastes different to still water. This is 
due 

72
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,860
to the 

73
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,600
ions dissolved in the water. They not 

74
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,300
only make the water more conductive for 
electricity because 

75
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,640
charged particles float in it, 

76
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,220
but also change the taste. 

77
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,420
Distilled water, i.e. water 

78
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,480
without ions, therefore 

79
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,120
does not conduct electricity. Whether 

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,540
the combination of particles of different 

81
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,500
elements is an atomic or 

82
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,440
ionic bond can also be 

83
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,720

84
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,140
recognized by the difference in their 
electronegativity. 

85
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,260
Electronegativity is a relative 

86
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,780
measure of the ability of an atom to 

87
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,680
attract electron pairs in a bond 

88
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,600
. It depends on the 

89
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,940
nuclear charge and the atomic radius as 
well as 

90
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,660
the number of outer electrons. 

91
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Halogens have a very high 

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,940
electronegativity, metals 

93
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,480
relatively low. The 

94
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,700
electronegativity of an element 

95
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,240
can be 

96
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,540
found in the periodic table. A high 
difference, usually 

97
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,580
over 1.7, results in an 

98
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,740
ionic bond in which the 

99
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,360
more electronegative particle 

100
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,480

101
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,220
rips out the outer electron(s) of the 
other , as is the case with sodium 
chloride 

102
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,820
. If the difference is 

103
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,900
relatively small, however, 

104
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,880
the atoms share their outer electrons and 
it is 

105
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,660

106
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,300
an electron pair bond, i.e. a 

107
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,560
molecule like water. 

108
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,860
The bond between metals and 

109
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,440
non-metals is often 

110
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,260
an ionic bond. The resulting 

111
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,820
structure is usually a 

112
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,220
salt crystal with its typical 

113
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,560
properties. The reason for the 

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,420
bonding of molecules or ions from 

115
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,720
atoms is the striving of all elements 

116
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,600
for a full outer shell, the 

117
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,140
so-called noble gas configuration. 

118
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,500
Thank you for your attention. 

119
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,900
I hope this video has helped you to 

120
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,440
better understand the topic of 

121
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,380
atoms, molecules and ions. 

122
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,680
See you next time.
