00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,650
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,830
Derivation Rules. In 

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,210
this webinar, we will be looking at the 
higher 

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,850
derivative rules. This means 

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,130
that we will look at the chain rule, the 

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,870
product rule and finally the 

7
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,290
quotient rule. 

8
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,150
But first of all, let's look 

9
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,710
at what is a derivative again 

10
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,870
and what do we need 

11
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,750
it for ? We need a derivative 

12
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,510
to 

13
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,610

14
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,710
calculate the gradient of a function at a 
certain point. This means 

15
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,470
, for example, that we see a parabola here 
and 

16
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,070
unfortunately we also notice that the 
gradient 

17
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,710
is not constant. Unlike 

18
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,390
a degree, which 

19
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,330
has the same slope everywhere , functions 
from the 

20
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,450
second degree onwards no 

21
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,950
longer have a uniform slope. Therefore, we 
can 

22
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,430
no longer create a slope triangle 

23
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,190
, or the creation of a 

24
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,330
slope triangle is only an 

25
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,370
approximation method or to show it 

26
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,710
visually , as here. In order to 

27
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,190
finally determine the gradient 

28
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,770
, we unfortunately 

29
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,710
always have to calculate it. And this is 
exactly what 

30
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,350
we need the first derivative for. 

31
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,390
This is because the first derivative 

32
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,390
always provides us with the instantaneous 
phase of change 

33
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,510
of the output function at a point, 

34
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,310
i.e. the gradient . And we have 

35
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,210

36
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,450

37
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,790
demonstrated the principle of determining 
the gradient at a point here. Here we have 
our 

38
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,690
initial function f of x, which is 

39
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,130
x² plus 3x minus 1, and we want to 

40
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,810

41
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,630
determine the gradient at the point x 
equals 2. First, 

42
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,650
we need to 

43
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,110
form the derivative. This means that if we 

44
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,830

45
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,550
have a normal, completely rational 
function , as we see here, which 

46
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,250
does not 

47
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,890
contain a product or fraction , then we 
can 

48
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,270
simply 

49
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,450
do this with the normal derivative. In 
other words, we multiply 

50
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,330
by the exponent 

51
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,930
and then reduce it by 1. This means that 

52
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,750
x² becomes 2x. If we 

53
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,210
have a linear element, the x is simply 
omitted 

54
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,530
, i.e. 3x is derived to a 3 

55
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,230
and the constants are also omitted. 

56
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,390
The first derivative in 

57
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,030
this case is therefore f' of x is equal to 
2x 

58
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,570
plus 3. To finally 

59
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,490
determine the gradient at the point, 

60
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,690
we now insert our point into the 

61
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,270
first derivative, i.e. we 

62
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,750
determine f' of 2, which is then 

63
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,470
equal to 2 times 2 plus 3, 2 times 2 is 4 

64
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,190
and 4 plus 3 is then correspondingly 

65
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,730
7. So we now know that the 

66
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,290
gradient of the function f of x at the 

67
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,650
point x is equal to 2 7. And 

68
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,110
that 

69
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,470
completes the task. Of course 

70
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,450
, the functions are not always so simple 

71
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,450
and you also have functions that 

72
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,110
are not completely rational and for 

73
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,030
these you then need other 

74
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,630
derivation rules. 

75
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,370
We will 

76
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,650
look 

77
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,170
at three more derivation rules in the 
webinar . These are also 

78
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,690
the ones you 

79
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,910
need the most. And then I would say 

80
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,150
let's actually get started. First, 

81
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,310
let's take a look at the chain rule. 

82
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,670
The chain rule is always 

83
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,470
used when two functions 

84
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,190
are linked together. 

85
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,930
In other words, there is an inner and an 

86
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,670
outer function. We will 

87
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,870

88
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,930
discuss this in more detail in a moment. 
Classic 

89
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,810
examples of the chain rule are 

90
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,350
functions where... exponents there is 
still 

91
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,350
a function equation or 

92
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,430
, as here, you have a bracket which 

93
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,930
in the example has a power of 1 you 

94
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,370
don't necessarily need the chain rule, but 

95
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,770
you can also 

96
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,970
apply the chain rule to it if the exponent 

97
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,130
is greater, i.e. a power of 2 to the power 
of 3 to the power of 5 

98
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,710
and so on, then the 

99
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,010
chain rule is unavoidable I have 

100
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,910
come up with counterexamples such as f of 
x 

101
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,910
equals 3x or f of x equals 5 x 

102
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,030
to the power of 3 there we 

103
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,770
don't need the chain rule Another 

104
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,630
example of functions where you 

105
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,670
need the chain rule are 

106
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,810
trigonometric functions , by the way . If 
you 

107
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,970

108
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,530
have the function variable within the sine 
or cosine 

109
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,930
and want to derive it, you 

110
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,690
inevitably need the chain rule. And so 

111
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,370
we will now demonstrate it. 

112
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,210
We are now referring to the 

113
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,650
example of 3 times x²-4 to the power of 5. 
This 

114
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,770
means that what is in the brackets here 

115
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,710
, which is projected, is the 

116
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,290
inner function, because it is 

117
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,770
inside the brackets. I think that's a 

118
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,530
pretty good way to 

119
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,430
visualize it. And the outer function 

120
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,390
is what 

121
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,750
surrounds the inner function , i.e. 3 
times the brackets to the power of 

122
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,990
5. And this is how we determine the 

123
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,170
derivative. When we 

124
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,090
derive this using the chain rule, we 

125
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,730
always consider the following structure. 
Vf of x is 

126
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,850
equal to u of v of x, i.e. v of 

127
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,650
x is the inner function and u is 

128
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,330
the outer function. The first 

129
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,550
derivative is then v' of x times u' 

130
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,070
of v of x. This means that the inner 

131
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,430
function is derived times the derivative 
of the 

132
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,510
outer function and 

133
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,330
the old inner 

134
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,090
function equation is still inside. 

135
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,810
This is why the mnemonic inner times outer 

136
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,010
derivative is so common. Please 

137
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,870
remember that 

138
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,450
nothing happens within the outer function 
equation, 

139
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,470
it remains the same. This means that in 
order to 

140
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,970
finally 

141
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,710
determine our derivative , we now first go 

142
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,730
and determine our inner and 

143
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,830
outer derivative as well as the 

144
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,470
corresponding derivatives. Well, v of 

145
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,610
x is then equal to x²-4, i.e. our 

146
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,590
inner function, u of x is equal to 

147
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,490
3x to the power of 5 or 3x to the power of 
5. 3 times a 

148
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,370
bracket to the power of 5 and we 

149
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,510
now form the derivative. x² is 

150
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,970
derived, 2x, the minus 4 is omitted. 

151
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,950
3x to the power of 5 or 3 times the 
bracket to the power of 

152
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,170
5 becomes 5 times 3 times the bracket 

153
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,490
to the power of 4. So simply 

154
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,570
multiply by the exponent here too and 

155
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,890
reduce the exponent by 1. Therefore, 

156
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,790
we only have one to the power of 4. 5 
times 

157
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,150
3 is then 15. Consequently, we have 15 

158
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,090
times the bracket to the power of 4. u 
dash v 

159
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,590
dash and our v and can thus 

160
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,930
tune the first derivative we 

161
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,110
now simply put v dash u dash and v 

162
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,570
in the places we see here 

163
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,370
that is 15 times bracket on x 

164
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,250
square minus four bracket to the power of 
4 

165
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,090
so this is still our inner 

166
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,430
function equation and the 15 times the 

167
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,450
bracket to the power of 4 is the new outer 

168
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,870
function so the first derivative of the 

169
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,470
outer function and the times 2x, which 

170
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,190
are the derivative of the inner 

171
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,430
function. We can now 

172
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,090
simplify this in this case. 15 times 2x 

173
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,990
is 30x and so we 

174
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,370
arrive at 30x times brackets to the 

175
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,210
power of x² minus 4 brackets to the power 
of 4 and so we have now 

176
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,050
successfully 

177
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,890
determined our first derivative. We have 

178
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,510
another example for this. This 

179
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,950
really shows that it's a bit shorter. And 
that's how 

180
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,130
it's often really 

181
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,070
written down when you 

182
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,090
calculate it , because it's still 

183
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,230
very clear and can be done 

184
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,890
at a reasonable speed. 

185
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,330
In this case, we have the example f 

186
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,530
of x is equal to 1 half times x² minus 

187
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,570
3x plus 1, the whole to the power of 3. 

188
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,090
First, we 

189
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,470

190
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,390
write down our inner and outer functional 
equation . The inner functional equation V 

191
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,330
of X is equal to X² minus 3X plus 1 

192
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,810
and the outer functional equation U 

193
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,170
of X is equal to 1.5 times 

194
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,770
parenthesis to the power of 3 or 1.5X to 
the power of 3. 

195
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,870
You can now imagine this 

196
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,330
however you like. And in the next 

197
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,110
step we derive V and U. This 

198
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,790
means that V' of X is then equal to 2X 

199
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,510
minus 3, simply the derivative 

200
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,290
of this. U' of x is then equal to 1 

201
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,230
half times 3 times the bracket to the 
power of 2 only 

202
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,110
1 half times 3 can also 

203
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,730
simply be made into 3 halves And 

204
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,250
we now enter this into the formula So we 
arrive 

205
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,510
at 3 halves times the bracket to x² 

206
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,310
minus 3x plus 1 bracket to the power of 2 
times 

207
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,690
2x minus 3 So as I said, this is 

208
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,130
still the normal inner 

209
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,710
function These 3 halves times the 

210
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,410
bracket to the power of 2 is the 
derivative of the 

211
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,870
outer function And the 2x-3 here at the 

212
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,550
end is the derivative of the 

213
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,070
inner function. It's still 

214
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,370
a bit confusing as it is , so you could 

215
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,430
simplify it by 

216
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,090
dragging the 3 halves in here. And that 
brings us to 

217
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,010
the next 

218
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,310
derivation rule, which is the 

219
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,630
product rule. The product rule 

220
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,130
is always used when we 

221
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,330

222
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,270
multiply two functions together . This 
means 

223
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,830
that we see a first function here and 

224
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,830
a second function here and these are 

225
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,290
separated by a sign. 

226
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,710
We speak of the first and second function 
here 

227
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,910
because it is not 

228
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,610
too important which of the 

229
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,290
two we define as u and v respectively. 

230
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,090
Therefore, we simply speak of a 

231
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,190
first and a second function and 

232
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,370
one is called u of x and the other 

233
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,090
is called v of x. Importantly, it only 

234
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,990
matters which 

235
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,410
is u and which is v for the product rule. 

236
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,690

237
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,370
It doesn't matter for the chain rule, 
which we just had, 

238
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,050

239
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,350
and it doesn't matter for the third 
derivative rule, which follows shortly. 
This 

240
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,930
is only the case with the product rule. 

241
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,850
We'll see why this is the case 

242
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,110
in a moment. So as I said, 

243
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,730
product rule, we have two 

244
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,570
function terms that both 

245
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,030
contain our variable and 

246
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,450
are multiplied by each other . and 
therefore 

247
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,070
we form a product and need 

248
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,510
our product rule accordingly. 

249
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,770
Here we see the structure u times v , 

250
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,970
i.e. one of the two functions that 

251
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,090
are multiplied together 

252
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,490
is called u , the other is called v . The 
first 

253
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,870
derivative is then u' times v plus u 

254
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,070
times v' . We see that we have 

255
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,330
a plus here, which 

256
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,650
means that we can also swap these two 
terms, in which case 

257
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,890
nothing more happens, i.e. the 

258
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,210
two multiplications. Whether we now 

259
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,310

260
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,450
calculate u' from x times v from x plus u 
from x times v' from x or u from x times 
v' 

261
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,770
from x plus u' from x times v from x, 

262
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,870
it doesn't matter. Therefore, we can 

263
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,670
swap it with the product rule. The 
mnemonic 

264
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,330
behind this is first function 

265
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,010
derived times second not 

266
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,030
derived plus first function not 

267
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,330
derived times second derived. 

268
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,770
So you multiply one 

269
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,730
derived function by the 

270
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,270
non-derived function . The important thing 
is that you 

271
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,050
have derived both once at the end. 

272
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,790
And 

273
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,870
we will now use this example to illustrate 
this further. 

274
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,490
We have the example f of x is 

275
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,730
equal to 3x² times 5x³ minus 2x. Our u 

276
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,390
of x is then 3x², our v of x is 

277
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,090
then equal to 5x³ minus 2x. And we 

278
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,710
now first form the first 

279
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,010
derivatives of u and of v. That 

280
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,730
is, u... line of x is then 2 

281
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,490
times 3x, which is 6x. V' of x is 

282
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,050
then equal to 3 times 5x² minus 2. 3 times 

283
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,950
5x² is then 15x² minus 2. And so 

284
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,070
we have our four terms that we 

285
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,350
need to 

286
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,730
determine the derivative. We now insert 
our u, 

287
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,910
v, u' and v' into the formula for the 

288
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,070
derivative. So u' of x times v 

289
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,010
of x plus u of x times v' of x. 

290
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,550
This gives us 6x times 5x to the power of 
3 minus 

291
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:31,050
2x plus 3x² times 15x² minus 2. This is 

292
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,210
basically our first 

293
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,230
derivative. If we 

294
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,030
were to insert an x there now , we would 
really have 

295
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,610
the increase at this point. 

296
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,230
However, it is not necessarily expedient 

297
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,710
to continue calculating with this result. 

298
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,410
That's why you should always try 

299
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,410
to simplify at the end. And that's what 

300
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,210
we do. We also multiply 

301
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,190
out the brackets. 

302
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,570
Of course, it would be fair to say that 

303
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,310
if we had 

304
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,630
multiplied the brackets out at the 
beginning, we wouldn 

305
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,330
't have needed a product rule. That 

306
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,870
is true. However, we will 

307
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,530
also look at an example of an 

308
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,790
E-function here and with E-functions 

309
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,470
it is usually unavoidable that you 

310
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,930
need the product rule, i.e. with 

311
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,810
compound E-functions. 

312
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,670
As I said, we have an 

313
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,610
example of this in a moment. Well, we're 
going to factor 

314
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,790
out for now, i.e. 6x times 5x 

315
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,230
to the power of 3 is 6x times minus 2x and 
6x 

316
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,350
times 5x to the power of 3 is 30x to the 
power of 4, 6x times 

317
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,070
minus 2x is minus 12x², 3x² times 

318
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,290
15x² is 45x to the power of 4 and 3x² 
times 

319
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,990
minus 2 is minus 6x². And 

320
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,630
we can 

321
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,750
summarize this even further , 30x to the 
power of 4 plus 45x 

322
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,030
to the power of 4 are the 75. x to the 
power of 4 minus 12 

323
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,790
x² minus 6 x² are the minus 18 x² 

324
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,510
and this is now really our 

325
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,550
derivation, with which we 

326
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,760
can continue to calculate wonderfully . 
Here we have 

327
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,480
the next example with 

328
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,860
the e-function. We see here, 

329
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,520
brackets open, 1 half x to the power of 3 
minus 5x 

330
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,320
plus 3, brackets closed, times e to the 
power of x. 

331
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,620
Here we have the e-function that 

332
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,800
contains our x and here we also have 

333
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,920
a term that contains our 

334
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,540
function variable x. Consequently, 

335
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,640
we definitely need the 

336
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,580
product rule. It should also be 

337
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,180
noted that in order to 

338
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,440
derive the e-function , we actually 

339
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
also need the chain rule. However, we 

340
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
only have e to the power of x, so we 

341
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,140
don't need the chain rule in this case, 
because 

342
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,880
e to the power of x is derived from e to 
the power of x. 

343
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,280
But you definitely need the 

344
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,920
chain rule, if you have something like 

345
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,220
e to the power of 2x or something more 
complex 

346
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,720
in the exponent yes, then 

347
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
you definitely need it, that 

348
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,160
's one more point well 

349
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,160
we first define our 

350
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,980
two function equations, that is 

351
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,080
u and v we have decided u 

352
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,980
of x is equal to 1 half x to the power of 
3 

353
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,960
minus 5x plus 3 and v of x is 

354
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,220
simply e to the power of x and next 

355
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,140
we determine the 

356
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,420
derivative of both. As we have just said, 

357
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,460
the derivative of e to the power of x is e 
to the power of 

358
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,940
x, so v' of x is equal to e 

359
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,800
to the power of x. Now we still need the 

360
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,920
derivative of u of x. u' of x is 

361
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,000
then equal to 3 half x² minus 5, so 

362
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,540
simply 1 half x to the power of 3 is 

363
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,380
derived from 3 half x, minus 5x is 

364
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,360
derived from minus 5 and the plus 3 

365
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
is omitted. and we now put 

366
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,540
all this back into the approach for the 

367
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,040
first derivative and thus 

368
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,800
arrive at, parenthesis open, 3 half x² 
minus 5, 

369
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,200
parenthesis closed, times e to the power 
of x plus, 

370
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,120
parenthesis open, 1 half x to the power of 
3 minus 5x 

371
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,020
plus 3, parenthesis closed, times e to the 
power of x. 

372
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,920
And in principle, that would already be 
our 

373
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,220
first derivative. The only problem 

374
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
we still have here is that if 

375
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,640
we have an e-function like this, 

376
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,520
we should always use it... If it 

377
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,580
is somehow possible. 

378
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,200
But first we have to make 

379
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,900
sure that we really have the same e 

380
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,200
-function both times.  So both times e 

381
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,660
to the power of x and not once e to the 
power of x and 

382
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,740
once 2 e to the power of x. We 

383
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,320
only have e to the power of x both times , 
so we can 

384
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
now 

385
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,100
add them together without any worries . So 
3 half x² minus 

386
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,280
5 plus 1 half x to the power of 3 minus 5x 
plus 

387
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,940
3. That's in this bracket. 

388
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,420
and if you simplify and 

389
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,640
organize it , you get 1 half x to the 
power of 3 

390
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,220
plus 3 half x squared minus 5x minus 

391
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,300
2 only, because minus 5 plus 3 is 

392
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
minus 2 and this bracket times e to the 
power of 

393
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
x and that's ultimately 

394
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,140
our solution. As you can see, this first 

395
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,520
derivative has the same 

396
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,420
structure as our function equation 

397
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,460
and it is much 

398
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,360
easier to continue calculating with it 
than with this. 

399
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,620
This brings 

400
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,460
us to the last derivation rule, 

401
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,180
the so-called quotient rule. The 

402
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,600
quotient rule is always 

403
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,480
used when there is a fraction 

404
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,540
that consists of a numerator and a 

405
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,880
denominator function. So 

406
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,840
please don't get confused. 

407
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
In order to 

408
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,420
use the quotient rule , you must 

409
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,400
have your variable in both the numerator 
and the denominator . So in 

410
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,240
both, that's really important. And 

411
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,400
now we also talk about u of x 

412
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,640
is the numerator function, v of 

413
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
x is the denominator function and 

414
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,940
here you really must not 

415
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,100
mix them up under any circumstances, 
otherwise you have 

416
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,820
unfortunately made a mistake. And 

417
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,040
that's why we often talk 

418
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,680
about numerator and denominator functions 
here. 

419
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,380
Our functional equation f of x has 

420
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,300
the structure u of x by v of x, 

421
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,540
so u of x is 

422
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,200
the numerator function, as just mentioned, 
and v of x 

423
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,500
is the denominator function. The first 

424
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,940
derivative is then u' of x times v 

425
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,100
of x minus, and that's why it's so 

426
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,140
important when we subtract here, 

427
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,060
so we can't 

428
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,160
mix it up any more. So minus u of x times 

429
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,200
v' of x, the whole thing divided by v 

430
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,820
of x squared. That means we 

431
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,000
end up dividing by our 

432
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,120
denominator function squared. I would 

433
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,780
always leave this with a power of 2 at the 

434
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,220
end, so you can see 

435
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,200
what it looks like straight away. And it 

436
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,400
doesn't necessarily always make sense to 
solve it 

437
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,980
using the binomial formula. 

438
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,960
So you could also formulate it 

439
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,680
as numerator derived times denominator 

440
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,880
minus numerator derived times denominator 

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
and everything 

442
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,950
divided by the denominator squared. And 

443
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,250
then we continue with this or apply it 

444
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,010
to our example. We have 

445
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,610
f of x is equal to 2x by x² minus 

446
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,830
4. 2x is our numerator function, x² 

447
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,490
minus 4. And here is our 

448
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,950
denominator function. First, 

449
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,790
we determine u' and v' again. The 

450
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,090
derivative of 2x is simply 2, and 

451
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,330
the derivative of x²-4 is also 2x. 

452
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,590
And with that, we have 

453
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,870
determined our four function terms, which 
we 

454
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,050
now insert back into our approach 

455
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,650
. Here we can see this 

456
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,350
again. f' of x is equal to u' of x 

457
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,850
times v of x minus u of x times v' of 

458
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,750
x. The whole thing divided by v of x 

459
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,710
squared. In our case, it 

460
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,870
looks like this, 2 times bracket on 

461
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,670
x² minus 4 bracket off minus 2x times 2x 

462
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,190
divided by x² minus 4 squared. 

463
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,830
Again, this is basically 

464
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,950
our derivative, but 

465
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,410
of course we 

466
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,310
should simplify it if possible, 

467
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,090
so this is our next 

468
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,030
step. First, we solve the... 

469
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,190
bracket, 2 times x² is 2x², 2 times 

470
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,970
minus 4 is minus 8 and minus 2x 

471
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,650
times 2x is minus 4x². 

472
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:45,810
We don't change the denominator , as I 

473
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,790
just said, it's best to leave it 

474
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,030
as it is. What we 

475
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,150
can see now is that we have 2x² minus 

476
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,610
4x² here , which we can also 

477
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,510
add together to get 

478
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,670
minus 2x² minus 8 and that is now 

479
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,950
really the final form of representation, 

480
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,690
which is already much more compact 

481
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,990
than... What we see here above. 

482
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,670
So it always makes sense to 

483
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,630
simplify it. Of course, we have 

484
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,670
another example of the 

485
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,050
quotient rule. We can see that here. 

486
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,230
f of x is equal to 4x²-0.2x±3 by 

487
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,410
x±1. Here too, 

488
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,590
we first define our numerator and our 

489
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,850
denominator function. our numerator 
function 

490
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,130
is 4x²-0.2x±3 and our 

491
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,470
denominator function is x±1. And now 

492
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,810
we do what we 

493
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,670
have always done now, 

494
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,570
i.e. derive the two functions, 

495
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,110
i.e. form u' and v'. u' is then 

496
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:49,170
4x² becomes 8x, -0.2x becomes -0.2 

497
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,870
and the plus 3 is omitted. This gives us 

498
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,340
4u' 8x-0.2. It is 

499
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,520
similar with v from x. We derive v from x, 

500
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,920
thus obtaining v' from x. x derived 

501
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,300
is 1. We must 

502
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,940
always think of x as 1x. Then 

503
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,520
the 1 remains and the plus 1 is omitted. 

504
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,220
We put these four terms back into 

505
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,820
the formula and arrive at, 

506
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,660
parenthesis open, 8x-0.2, parenthesis 
closed. 

507
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,800
As I said, this is our numerator function 

508
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,520
derived times x plus 1, this is 

509
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,440
our denominator function minus 

510
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,600
parenthesis to 4x² minus 0.2x plus 3, 

511
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,820
this is simply our numerator function 

512
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,000
and this is the derivative of our 

513
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,880
denominator function. And the whole thing 
divided 

514
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,000
by the denominator squared. And 

515
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,180
again, this is basically 

516
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,620
the first derivative. 

517
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,960
But of course we want to 

518
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,120
simplify it. That's why we dissolve the 

519
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
brackets. As we can see above, 

520
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,800
we are multiplying two brackets. 

521
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,060
So 8x times x, 8x times 1, minus 0 

522
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,700
.2 times x and minus 0.2 times 1. 8x times 

523
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,080
x is 8x², 8x times 1 is 

524
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,140
plus 8x, minus 0.2 times x is 

525
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,160
minus 0.2x and minus 0.2 times 1 is 

526
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,720
minus 0.2. You 

527
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,480
might think it's a 

528
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,220
bit easier here on the right, because 
we're 

529
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,560
only multiplying the parenthesis by 

530
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,480
1, but we have to be careful, there' 

531
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,760
s a minus in front of the parenthesis and 
so 

532
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,420
all the signs inside 

533
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,400
the parenthesis are reversed. So 4x² 

534
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,120
becomes minus 4x², minus 0.2x becomes 

535
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,960
plus 0.2x and plus 3 becomes 

536
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,620
minus 3. We have now 

537
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,560

538
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
resolved all of our brackets and are 

539
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,380
of course trying to add everything 
together that 

540
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,080
we can. As you can see, 

541
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,620
we don't do anything to the denominator. 
8x² minus 

542
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:50,000
4x² is 4x². 8x minus 0.2x plus 0.2x 

543
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,820
is simply plus 8x. And minus 0.2 

544
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,500
minus 3 is minus 3.2, so 

545
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,960
this is our first derivative. 

546
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,120
And that brings us to the end of the 

547
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,100
webinar. Thank you 

548
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,580
very much for your attention.
