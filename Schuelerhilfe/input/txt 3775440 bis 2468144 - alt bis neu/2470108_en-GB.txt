00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,150
Hello, my name is Nick and I am a 

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,670
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,330
Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,910
introduce you to the basics of 
photosynthesis 

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,910
. 

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,710

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,190
You can find more learning content, such 
as wikis, interactive tasks or worksheets, 
in 

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,070
our online learning center. 

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,490
Photosynthesis is the fundamental 

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,390
process that makes most of the 

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,390
life on this planet possible. 

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,510
It was only through photosynthesis 

13
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,170
that enough oxygen entered the atmosphere 

14
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,230
to make it breathable. 

15
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,230
At the same time, photosynthesis 

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,530
also 

17
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,250
enables the production of plant biomass. 

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,630
Plants in turn form the lowest 

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,390
level of the food chain and are 

20
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,210
therefore essential for the existence of 

21
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,950
plants and carnivores. 

22
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,010
Photosynthesis is such an 

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,570
important and relevant process 

24
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,430
that mankind has been 

25
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,590
trying to copy it for a long time. 

26
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,510
Photovoltaics can be seen as the process 

27
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,290
with which we 

28
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,790
have 

29
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,670
come closest to photosynthesis so far. 
What 

30
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,330
photosynthesis and photovoltaics have in 
common is 

31
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,590
that both processes draw their energy 

32
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,870
from sunlight. 

33
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,590
As a rule, plants are mostly green. 

34
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,170
This is due to 

35
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,950

36
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,190
chlorophyll , a substance that is 
essential for the survival of plants. The 
most important 

37
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,770
task of chlorophyll is to 

38
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,090
absorb and pass on the 

39
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,150
energy obtained from light. Plants 

40
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,230
absorb light in the red and blue 

41
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,150
range. Light in the green range is 

42
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,210
reflected. And this is precisely why 

43
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,090
plants are mostly green. 

44
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,870
Photosynthesis mainly takes place in 

45
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,770
the chloroplasts. Animals and 

46
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,370
humans do not have chloroplasts. 

47
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,050

48
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,370
Instead, we obtain our energy in 
mitochondria, which 

49
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,870

50
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,730
are very similar to chloroplasts . Another 

51
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,530
prerequisite for photosynthesis 

52
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,130
is the constant connection with the 

53
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,210
gases in the environment. Stomata are 

54
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,770
cells on the surface of 

55
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,490
leaves. These cells have a 

56
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,750
gap and thus connect the 

57
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,150
atmosphere with the inside of the 

58
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,730
leaf. They 

59
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,810

60
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,130
are responsible for transpiration, water 
and gas exchange. 

61
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,930
Now that we have 

62
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,350

63
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,690
dealt with the general information on 
photosynthesis 

64
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,390
, let's take a 

65
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,670
closer look at this biochemical process. 

66
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,050
As part of the light reaction, 

67
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,150
water is 

68
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,090
split using the energy obtained from the 
light. The 

69
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,730
resulting molecules, which 

70
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,270
are hydrocarbons 

71
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,870
, are in turn 

72
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,970
converted into energy that can be used 
directly by plants. 

73
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,390
As the name 

74
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,630
suggests , the dark reaction takes place 
in the dark. Therefore, 

75
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,130
the plant 

76
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,510
cannot directly 

77
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,690
access light energy in this reaction. 
Instead, the 

78
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,170

79
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,530
biomolecules used in the light reaction 
are used to 

80
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,310

81
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,350
produce the substances relevant to the 
plant's structure. All green plants, 

82
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,630
cyanobacteria and some 

83
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,810
other bacteria carry out 

84
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,070
photosynthesis. A few years ago 

85
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,670
, even an animal, a 

86
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,270
sea snail, was found that 

87
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,310
can photosynthesize. 

88
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,910
As a rule, however, this ability is 

89
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,810
reserved for plants. I hope that 

90
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,890
you have now 

91
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,730
understood the basics of photosynthesis. 

92
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,350
If you have any further questions, there 
is 

93
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,770
 of course more 

94
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,630
content available in the online learning 
center. See you 

95
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,070
next time.
