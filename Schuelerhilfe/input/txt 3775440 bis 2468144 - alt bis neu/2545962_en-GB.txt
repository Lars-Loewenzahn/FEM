Mrs. Taylor wants to 

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,160
travel to Ireland for the first time. She 
wants to 

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,000

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,120
visit a hotel for a weekend in the center 
of Dublin and calls the hotel she 

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,280
found on the website. 

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,920
Good morning, this is the Dublin 

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,820
Skyline Hotel. Jan Busch speaking. How 

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,220
can I help you? Hello, Mr. 

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,640
Busch. I would like to 

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,220
make a reservation at your hotel for the 
last weekend in July. Do you have 

12
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,240
any departures? Just let 

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,300
me have a quick look, but that should 

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,300
be possible. What is the exact date 

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,400
of your arrival? The date of arrival 

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,920
would be the 23rd. And how long will 

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,920
you be staying? The whole weekend, if 

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,240
it's possible. So, until the 25th of 

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,920
July. That is possible. We have 

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,300
several rooms available. How many 

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,380
people is the reservation for? There 

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,360
will be three of us, and we need one 

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,120
single and one double room. Sure. And 

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
would you like a room with... Twin 

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,380
beds or a double bed? A double bed, 

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,920
please. It's for me and my husband. 

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,940
Great. Would you prefer to have a 

28
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,860

room with a garden view, which are in 

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,780

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,600
of room is still available, I would 

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,380
love to have the ocean view and for 

33
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,740
the single room as well, please. What 

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,360

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,840

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,520
