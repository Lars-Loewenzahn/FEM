00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,630
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,730
Linear Systems of Equations. 

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,830
First of all, I hope you can hear me. 

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,570
If so, please write 

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,350
a short yes or okay 

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,530
in the chat at the bottom right. As 

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,640
I said, if you can hear me, 

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,380
please write a short yes or okay 

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,080
or something else 

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,380
in the chat at the bottom right. Okay, it 
works 

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,280
wonderfully. Then we'll start 

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,800
the webinar as usual. 

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,160
Today, we will primarily be looking at the 

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,440
Gaussian algorithm. In other words, I'm 

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,460
going to demonstrate the Gaussian 
algorithm using 

16
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,520
a small example 

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,680
so that we 

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,560
can take a closer look at how it 

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,060
works. We will then take a look 

20
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,580
at a small problem on linear 

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,680
systems of equations and look 

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,380
in particular at underdetermined 

23
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,960
systems of equations, how to 

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,040
deal with these and still 

25
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,360
work out a solution . If there is a 
question on any 

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,720
point or at any time, 

27
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,500

28
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,860
please write the question in 

29
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,620
the chat at the bottom right. Then I can 

30
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,740
definitely get back to you directly. 

31
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,000
But I also hope that we will 

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,480
have time for a short Q&A session at the 
end 

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,200
. Let's start with the Gaussian 

34
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,180
 algorithm. The Gauss algorithm 

35
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,220
is a straightforward 

36
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,520
method for solving 

37
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,860
systems of linear equations. 

38
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,660
As is usual with algorithms, you 

39
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,880
always do the same thing and follow a 

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,360
fixed pattern. This means that it is 

41
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,340
always quite clear what you 

42
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,200
do next. This is the difference 

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,440
between the addition and 

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,050
subtraction method. With the Gauss 

45
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,590
 algorithm, you simplify the 

46
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,090
original equations using 

47
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,470
other equations. This means that, 

48
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,130
as with the addition method , 

49
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,370
you add and subtract equations 

50
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,350
and thus achieve that variables are 

51
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,470
canceled out. So the Gauss 

52
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,070
 algorithm is based on the 

53
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,050
addition method, but is a 

54
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,010
special form of it because it 

55
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,970
is an algorithm. The reason for this will 

56
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,090
become clear in a moment. At the very 

57
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,690
end, if you 

58
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,290
know a variable , you insert it into the 

59
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,770
equation above it in order to 

60
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,350
find all the variables at the end. 

61
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,090
to determine . We'll see that 

62
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,030
in a moment, it's 

63
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,590
quite clear what happens with the Gauss 
algorithm 

64
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,310
. The aim of the Gaussian 

65
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,630
algorithm is 

66
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,850
to get a diagonal into it. This means that 

67
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,990
in the end we want the first equation 

68
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,910
to contain x, y and z, the second 

69
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,950
y and z and the third only 

70
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,370
z. Once we have achieved this, 

71
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,230
we immediately know the solution for z, 

72
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,050
which we can 

73
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,730
take from the third equation. We 

74
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,130
then insert this into the second equation 
and 

75
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,770
thus break our y. 

76
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,310
Once we have done this , we insert the 
solution 

77
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,770
for y and for z into the first 

78
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,070
equation and can thus 

79
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,850
calculate our x. That's the 

80
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,230
backwards substitution that just came up. 

81
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,210
The one that comes from the bottom, that 
continues to 

82
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,110
insert upwards and so in the 

83
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,430
end knows all the solutions. The aim 

84
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,990
of the Gauss-Eurotm 

85
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,890
is to achieve this diagonal , as I said, 
and you 

86
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,210
end up adding and subtracting 

87
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,730
equations until you 

88
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,670
have reached this diagonal. How often this 

89
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,910
is depends on how many 

90
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,690
equations you have. In our case, 

91
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,230
we have three equations. The first 

92
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,810
is x plus 2y plus 3z equals 

93
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,810
2. The second equation is x plus 

94
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,230
y plus z equals 2. And the third 

95
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,850
equation is 3. x plus 3y plus z 

96
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,470
equals 0. And in the Gauss 

97
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,110
 algorithm ,  we always use the 

98
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,690
first equation to 

99
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,570
add or subtract. When 

100
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,210
adding and subtracting 

101
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,150
, the first variable, in this 

102
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,110
case x and 3x, should always be dropped. 
The 

103
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,170
question we now 

104
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,750
have to ask ourselves is how often we have 
to 

105
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,130
add 

106
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,730
or subtract equation 1 to equation 2 so 
that the x is 

107
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,510
dropped out. The solution is... we have to 

108
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,850

109
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,470
subtract equation 1 from equation 2 once 
and then we have x 

110
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,370
minus x and then our x has 

111
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,550
been canceled out in equation 3 this is 

112
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,470
similar only here we have 3x 

113
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,430
so we have to 

114
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,250
calculate equation 3 minus 3 times 

115
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,390

116
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,850

117
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,670

118
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,010

119
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,010

120
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,110
equation 1 so that we simply have 3x minus 
3 times x and it is also 0x again and it 
is also canceled out again 

121
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,510
. This means that we 

122
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,890
not only calculate x minus x, but also y 

123
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,610
minus 2y, z minus 3z, 2 minus 2. 

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,880
In the third equation 

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
, we multiply the first 

126
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,680
equation by 3 before we 

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,820
multiply, which makes it 

128
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,720
a little more difficult. So we have 

129
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,580
3x minus 3 times x plus 3y minus 3 

130
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,120
times 2y plus z minus 3 times 3z and 0 

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,980
minus 3 times 2. So 

132
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,240
multiply everything by 3. And 

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
if you 

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
subtract here too, you have to 

135
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,900
pay attention to the signatures . In this 
case we are 

136
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,840
lucky, we only have 

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,200
plus signs up here , which means that 
everything 

138
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,380
becomes minus. But always remember, 

139
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,100
if there is something negative, minus 

140
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,580
times minus is plus. And then 

141
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,690
, of course, you have to do the math. 3x 
minus 

142
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,730
3x, sorry, x minus x is 

143
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,250
0. Plus y minus 2y is minus y. z 

144
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,410
minus 3z is minus 2z and 2 minus 2 

145
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,490
is 0. 3x minus 3x is 0. So 

146
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,690
you can see that you've done everything 
right 

147
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,590
by the fact that 

148
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,890
there are zeros here. Then 

149
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,850
the factors here are probably correct . 
That was the 

150
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,790
point of this addition or 

151
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,250
subtraction, that the x is 

152
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,250
canceled out. And then 

153
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,030
, of course, we continue. 3y minus 3 times 

154
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,070
2y. 3 times 2y is 6y, so 3y minus 

155
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,930
6y is minus 3y. And then we have 

156
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,750
z minus 3 times 3z. Minus 3 times 3z is 

157
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,890
minus 9z. And z minus 9z is then 

158
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,910
minus 8z. On the other hand, we 

159
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,130
then have 0 minus 3 times... 2. minus 3 

160
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,210
times 2 is then minus 6. This is 

161
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,250
now our new 

162
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,570
system of equations. Whenever we 

163
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,130

164
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,750
have added or subtracted two equations , 
they are given a new 

165
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,230
name. Simply so that we know 

166
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,190
that the equation is no longer so 

167
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,050
easy to find again. Because 

168
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,690
now you can no longer really tell 

169
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,590
where this equation comes from. It's 

170
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,870
not a simple transformation. We' 

171
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,090
ve added two equations together, so we' 

172
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,130
ve got a new equation 

173
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,050
. That's why we've given it 

174
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,910
a new number. They are 

175
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,370
simply 

176
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,510
distributed consecutively . So this is 
equation 4, 

177
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,650
this is equation 5 soon. Well, 

178
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,030
that brings us to this 

179
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,510
system of equations. If we 

180
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,790
want to bring in the diagonal 

181
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,130
, we have to remove the minus 3y here. 

182
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,630
The second equation, or 

183
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,310
in this case equation 4, is already 
correct 

184
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,850
. We just have to remove the minus 3y 

185
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,830
. And so we ask ourselves 

186
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:07,190
again, how many times do we have to 

187
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,130

188
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,270
add the fourth equation to the fifth 
equation or perhaps 

189
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,110
subtract it so that the minus 3y 

190
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,010
is removed? As a little tip, if you 

191
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,730
have the same sign here, i.e. 

192
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,330
plus and plus or minus and minus, 

193
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,330
as in this case, then you will 

194
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,030
always have to subtract. In other words, 

195
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,330
we calculate equation 5 minus, in this 

196
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,730
case 3 times equation 4, which is minus 

197
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,710
simply because we have 

198
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,210
the same sign here . 

199
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,830
This means that in this case we have 

200
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,030
equation 4 3 times , because here we 

201
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,270
only have y, here we have 3y, so 

202
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,310
we need the 4th equation 3 times 

203
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,550
and then the calculation 

204
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,430
starts all over again. Minus 3y minus 3 
times minus 3 

205
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,490
minus y, that's minus minus is 

206
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,110
plus, that means we have minus 3y 

207
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,690
plus 3y, that's 0, then it goes 

208
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,010
on, minus 8z minus minus 3 times 

209
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,550
minus 2z. Again, minus times 

210
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,190
minus is plus. That means we have 

211
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,330
plus 6z, minus 8z, plus 6z is 

212
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,610
minus 2z. 

213
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,390
And so we have 

214
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,650

215
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,630
already created the system of equations, 
or the diagonal. We 

216
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,770
can see here that the diagonal is 

217
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,830
present. We give the last 

218
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,950
equation a new name, 

219
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,430
which is equation 6 

220
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,070
. and 

221
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,310
determine the z we can 

222
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,630
easily determine the z by just 

223
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,530
dividing by minus two the 

224
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,890
z alone is here on the page 

225
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,350
we have done that here once then 

226
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,550
the z is equal to 3 and now that we 

227
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,210
know that we put the z equal to 3 

228
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,130
in the equation 4 that is in 

229
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,010
minus y minus 2 z equal to 0 we 

230
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,310
then put in here so we come to minus 

231
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,630
y, minus 2 times 3 equals 0, minus 

232
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,370
2 times 3 equals minus 6, so minus y 

233
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,610
minus 6 equals 0 and 

234
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,750
now we simply transform y, 

235
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,230
the easiest way to do this is 

236
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,090
to calculate plus y, then it says minus 6 

237
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,490
equals y. Now we know our 

238
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,550
two variables z and y, 

239
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,770
the only thing missing is the x, which 

240
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,270
we insert into equation 

241
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,550
1. It then looks like this. So x 

242
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,010
plus 2y plus 3z equals 2, that's 

243
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,070
our approach here, our y was 

244
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,370
minus 6, our z was 3, we put it in like 
this, so we 

245
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,590
get x plus 2 times 

246
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,570
minus 6 plus 3 times 3 equals 2, 2 

247
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,930
times minus 6 equals minus 12, 3 times 3 
equals 

248
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,510
plus 9 and minus 12 plus 9 

249
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,830
equals minus 3. And so 

250
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,990
we arrive at x, minus 3 equals 2, the 3 

251
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,130
just has to go over, so 

252
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,950
we calculate plus 3 and then it says x 

253
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,130
equals 5. We can then 

254
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,630
conclude that the solution 

255
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,490
to the system of equations is x equals 5, 

256
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,170
y equals minus 6 and z equals 3. Is 

257
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,930
there a question about this? So 

258
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,390
we have 

259
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,930
successfully applied the Gauss algorithm . 
Or was that 

260
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:09,750
clear enough? 

261
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,080
Okay, great. Let's 

262
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,460
continue with a factual task on the 

263
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,600
system of linear equations. 

264
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,100
here we see the graphical 

265
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,040
representation of the solution if there 

266
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,520
is exactly one solution then there is an 

267
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,180
intersection point and you get a 

268
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,660
unique x and y the whole thing is only 

269
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,600
shown in two dimensions that 

270
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
means if you only had 22 

271
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,340
variables the whole thing also exists for 

272
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,960
three variables in 3d in 

273
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,660
three dimensions and yes that is the 

274
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,800
case as I said always 

275
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
has exactly one solution if you don't 

276
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,660
have a solution the two are parallel 

277
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,680
to each other, this means that 

278
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,220
a false statement arises , something like 
6 is 

279
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,820
equal to 0 or 6 is equal to minus 6, 

280
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,080
which can also be the case. And that 

281
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,120
simply indicates that there 

282
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,560
is no point of intersection and the 

283
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,020
lines are parallel in 

284
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,720
two dimensions or, if you look at it 

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,480
from three dimensions, 

286
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,100
they can 

287
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,240
only be skewed in addition to the 
parallels . But here 

288
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,740
only two-dimensional is shown. shows. 

289
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,440
The latter is the possibility that 

290
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,160
there are infinitely many solutions. This 

291
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,500
ultimately means that the 

292
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,900
straight lines lie inside each other. 
That's why 

293
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,420
we only see one here. And this 

294
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,960
is simply expressed by the fact that you 

295
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,440
get a true statement. Something 

296
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,880
like 0 is equal to 0, which shows 

297
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,540
that it is the same straight line and 

298
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,280
all the straight lines lie on top of each 
other. 

299
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,560
So there are an infinite number of common 

300
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,230
points. That's how you can 

301
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,690
understand the whole thing. And that 
brings us 

302
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,810
to another 

303
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,290
system of linear equations. I'll 

304
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,130
just say right away that this is the 

305
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,990
system of equations where we 

306
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,410

307
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,350
will get an underdetermined system of 
equations . 

308
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,010
At first glance , it doesn't seem so, 
because if 

309
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,210
you look, we have three 

310
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,490
unknown x, y and z and three 

311
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,790
equations. In other words, at 

312
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,590
first glance you would think that we 

313
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,810
have enough equations. The 

314
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,830
only problem is that we will later 

315
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,790
realize that some equations 

316
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,290
from here are multiples of each other. 

317
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,010
And we can 

318
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,390
only evaluate multiple equations as one 
equation. Otherwise 

319
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,730
I could turn one equation 

320
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,470
into any number of equations . 

321
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,670
And 

322
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,050
we'll see in a moment how to work out a 
solution anyway. 

323
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,530
Of course, we don't know at the beginning 

324
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,610
that this is an underdetermined 

325
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,870
system of equations, so 

326
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,070
we start as normal with our Gauss 

327
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,370
 algorithm. 

328
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,310
The first thing  we want to do 

329
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,970
is delete the 6x and the 3x , so we 
calculate 

330
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,990
equation 2 minus 6 times equation 1 

331
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,870
and equation 3 minus 3 times equation 

332
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,730
1. We then arrive at 0 minus 6y 

333
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,890
minus 16z is equal to minus 12 and 0 

334
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,130
minus 3y minus 8z is equal to minus 6. 

335
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,250
So 3x minus 3 times x 

336
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,110
is 0, 3y minus 3 times 2y. 

337
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,290
are in this case minus 3y, so we 

338
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,030
have plus 3y minus 6y are minus 

339
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:21,030
3y, then z, minus 3 times 3z, so z 

340
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,730
minus 9z are minus 8z and minus 3 

341
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,230
times 2 is the minus 6 here in the 

342
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,290
equation above, 6y minus 6 times 2 

343
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,290
are 6y minus 12y, are then together 

344
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:44,410
minus 6y and 2z minus 6 times 3z, minus 

345
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,690
6 times 3z are minus 18z and 2z minus 

346
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:56,150
18z are minus 16z. Back here 0, 

347
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,370
sorry, but 0 minus 6 times 2 

348
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,890
is minus 12. That's how we get here 

349
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,970
and we can see that we have 

350
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,710
successfully 

351
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,970
deleted our first equation again. In the 
next step, 

352
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,270
of course, we want to delete the minus 3y 

353
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,810
. And we do this by 

354
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,790
calculating 2 times equation 5 minus 

355
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,030
equation 4. Simply 2 times equation 

356
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,430
5 so that we have both times 6y. and 

357
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,650
then we suddenly realize 

358
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,370
that we get a zero line. 

359
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,710
A zero line is simply a 

360
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,510
line that drops out completely. If 

361
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,750
you look closely, you can see 

362
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,510
that the two 

363
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,910
equations 

364
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,050
are multiples of each other. The upper 
equation here is 

365
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,350
simply the lower equation 

366
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,090
multiplied by 2. Now that you 

367
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,730
know it, you would have seen it at the 

368
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,650
beginning, you can see that these are 

369
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,630
always the multiples. 0 times 2 

370
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,890
is also 0, 2 times 3 is 6, 3 times 2 

371
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,650
is also 6 and 2 times 1 is 2. 

372
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,650
In other words, you can already see here 
that these 

373
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,430
are multiples and the trained eye 

374
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,670
could see in advance that 

375
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,390
it 

376
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,850
is an underdetermined system of equations. 
And 

377
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,510
in the end, we've already 

378
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,710
demonstrated this. And the 

379
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,770
problem is that we 

380
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,970
now have three unknowns and only 

381
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,030
two equations. Therefore, we can 

382
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,450
no longer solve the system of equations 

383
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,850
determinately. We can only solve it 

384
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,130
depending on one 

385
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,370
parameter. This parameter 

386
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,970
is usually called Z. And 

387
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,590
now we can only solve X and Y as a 

388
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,990
function of Z. 

389
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,330
And that's what we do now. The fact that 
we use Z 

390
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,890
as a parameter 

391
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,030
means that z is 

392
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,970
no longer a variable for us, as 

393
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,970
before, but a 

394
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,730
parameter with a value. 

395
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,230
Depending on this, we 

396
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,450
ultimately want to 

397
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:53,070
be able to specify the y and the x. This 
means that our z remains z, 

398
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,530
but is no longer a variable. So, 

399
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,450
we can now solve equation 4 

400
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,030
, because we know z is 

401
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,130
our parameter, and y is the 

402
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,270
variable, we only have one 

403
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,110
variable. Variables are the 

404
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,710
equation, so we can 

405
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,750
rearrange equation 4 according to y. So 

406
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,370
minus 6y minus 16z is equal to minus 

407
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,830
12, we transform that. To minus 6y 

408
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,030
is equal to minus 12 plus 16z 

409
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,390
, we then divide that by minus 6 to 

410
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,690
get the y. And we 

411
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,470
then arrive at 2 minus 8 thirds z for y. 

412
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,910
This is now the solution for our 

413
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,910
variable y as a function of 

414
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,530
our z. As I said... only 

415
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,810
as a function of one 

416
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,310
parameter, because we 

417
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,250

418
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,490
have an underdetermined system of 
equations . This is always the case. 

419
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,790
We have now calculated our y. Our 

420
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,010
variable z is now simply the 

421
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,850
parameter z. So in the end, we 

422
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,210
enter z equals z as the solution, even 

423
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,470
if this has not yet 

424
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,790
been written down so explicitly. Now that 
we 

425
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,550
know z and y, the 

426
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,510
next step is to calculate our x. To do 
this, we 

427
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,430
insert our y into the first equation 

428
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:13,930
, i.e. into x plus 2y, but it is written 

429
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,830
correctly here , i.e. x plus 2y plus 3z 

430
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,970
equals 2, as it is 

431
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,530
written below. 

432
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,890
Finally, we have 

433
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,130

434
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,850
entered the value for the y that we have 
just determined in green. 

435
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,390
As I said, the z remains simply z because 
it 

436
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,270
is our parameter and we can see that 

437
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,470
we only have 

438
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,390
our x as a variant. That's why we'll now 

439
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,210
solve for x. The first thing we do is 
break 

440
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,450
up the brackets, so 2 times 2, 4 and 

441
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,290
2 times minus 8 thirds is minus 16 

442
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,430
thirds z. Now we have minus 16 

443
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,370
thirds z plus 3z, which is then 

444
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:53,790
minus 7 thirds z. This gives us 

445
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,090
x plus 4 minus 7 thirds z is equal to 

446
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,930
2. Next we calculate minus 4 

447
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,010
so that the 4 goes across. And 2 minus 4 

448
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,490
is the minus 2 here. So we arrive 

449
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,810
at x minus 7 thirds z is equal to 

450
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,070
minus 2. And then we can 

451
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,270
finally say that x is equal to 7 

452
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,530
thirds z minus 2. So we 

453
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,230
transform that by plus 7 thirds z. 

454
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,050
And with that we have 

455
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,600
also solved the system of equations. 

456
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,740
Are there any questions? I think it 

457
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,680
may seem 

458
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,420
a little abstract at first. 

459
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,330
Z is our parameter Z, which 

460
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,810
cannot be determined any further. As 

461
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,110
I said , this is our parameter. The only 

462
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,270
thing you can say is that Z equals Z, 

463
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,470
nothing more. 

464
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,170
Right, now let's come back to 

465
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,830
the instructions that we 

466
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,270
have done everything. So here is a brief 

467
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,630
and crisp summary of what 

468
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,990
we have just worked out or 

469
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,170
established. You can recognize an 

470
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,270
underdetermined system of equations 

471
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,530
simply by the fact that you either 

472
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,130
have fewer equations than you have 

473
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,370
unknown equations or if it 

474
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,330
seems determined at first , like our 

475
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,190
case right now, we get 

476
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,230
a zero line at some point. This means that 
one 

477
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,710
equation is omitted and then 

478
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,130
we suddenly have fewer equations 

479
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,310
than we have variables. Then it is 

480
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,910
clearly underdetermined. 

481
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,650
The first thing you do when you realize 
that 

482
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,850
the system of equations 

483
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,790
is underdetermined is to determine a 
variable 

484
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,470
as a parameter and you 

485
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,930
actually always take the last variable, 

486
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,850
i.e. Z. That's why we've 

487
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,930
just 

488
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,750
determined everything as a function of Z. 
And then we solve the 

489
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,250
system of equations as normal. 

490
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,830
In other words, the variable Z becomes 

491
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,630
a parameter and we solve all the 

492
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,150
other variables as a function of 

493
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,470
these introduced parameters. 

494
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,290
Parameters. It is important that 

495
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,030
only one parameter is introduced. 

496
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,210
It is not 

497
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,370
necessary to introduce two parameters. So 

498
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,070
at most, if two 

499
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,670
equations are really missing, you have to 

500
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,610
introduce two parameters. However, this 

501
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,070
does not occur in school mathematics 

502
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,410
and I am not aware of any cases where 

503
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,850
this is done at school. 

504
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,050
Therefore, only one parameter is ever 

505
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,850
introduced. And this is how you 

506
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,610
ultimately solve the underdetermined 

507
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,630
systems of equations. 

508
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,000
That brings us to the end 

509
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,280
of the webinar. But we still have 

510
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,580
time to clarify questions. In other words, 

511
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,500
if you have any questions, 

512
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,620
please feel free to ask them. 

513
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,380
And of course I'll 

514
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,340
be happy to answer them. 

515
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,070
If you don't have any questions... No 
questions? 

516
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,070
Okay. Then we're done. 

517
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,190
Thank you for your attention 

518
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,350
and have a nice 

519
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,530
evening.
