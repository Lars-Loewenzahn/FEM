00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,190
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,210
Benullikette and Binomial Distribution 
webinar . 

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,790
In this webinar, we will be looking at 

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,430
stochastics, i.e. the 

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,590
Benullic chain and the 

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,430
binomial distribution. We will 

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,870
also look at some special features 

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,070
and of course we will 

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,030
also take a very 

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,970
close look at the Benullic chain at the 
beginning. In other words, we will 

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,810
first talk about what 

12
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,550
a binomial distribution is. Then 

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,870
we will look at the meaning of the 

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,750
binomial coefficient. This is 

15
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,670
very important and once you 

16
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,750

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,470
have understood the meaning of this 
binomial coefficient 

18
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,190
, you 

19
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,190
will probably be able to understand the 
Bernoulli 

20
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,010
 chain a lot better. That's why 

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,370
we'll take a look 

22
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,210
at the Bernoulli chain afterwards. Then 
we'll look 

23
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,650
at the binomial distribution in 

24
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,290
general. So then we'll 

25
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,450
also do a bit of math with it. And 

26
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,370
at the very end, we'll also calculate 

27
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,950
with the Benulli chain again or 

28
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,570
look at special features of it, 

29
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,410
i.e. special problems. 

30
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,630
Well, let's start with the 

31
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,050
minimum distribution. First of all 

32
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,730
, the minimum distribution is 

33
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,650
a special type of discrete 

34
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,550
probability distribution. 

35
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,670
This means that a discrete 

36
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,790
probability distribution 

37
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,670
only exists if the 

38
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,750
random variable x, i.e. the event, 

39
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,730

40
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,630
is concentrated on a finite or foreseeable 
quantity. This means that 

41
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,410
our n is defined. 

42
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,250
We will see later what n is. And what is 

43
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,030
also 

44
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,750
very important for us with the BIM-R 
distribution is that there are only two 

45
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,370
possible outcomes. In other words, we 

46
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,350
either have a hit or 

47
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,730
a precipitation. or 

48
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,730
a success or a failure, which 

49
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,910
means that our event can occur 

50
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,410
or it can fail to occur. there are only 

51
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,890
these two possibilities, there is 

52
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,590
no third possibility. 

53
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,370
so let's take a look 

54
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,530
at how this 

55
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,530
minimum coefficient sits together and 

56
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,650
what that actually means. we see 

57
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,010
three balls of different 

58
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,130
colors here and we have four places. the 

59
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,270
question now is, how many 

60
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,990
different ways are there to 

61
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,230

62
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,490
distribute these three balls over four 
places ? We have 

63
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,850
divided this into roughly four. 

64
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,750
You can see here that the 

65
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,030
empty space has always been moved. Here 

66
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,430
it's on the far left. So here it's in 

67
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,390
the first place, here in the 

68
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,350
second place, here in the third 

69
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,970
place and down here in the fourth 

70
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,450
place. This means that you can 

71
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,490
move the space first and 

72
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,350
then you can 

73
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,590
vary the order here. In other words, we 
see 

74
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,410
that green is in front twice and 

75
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,890
then the other two 

76
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,750
colors change and it goes on like this. 

77
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,890
In other words, we can see here that 

78
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,510
we have four options for moving the 

79
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,230
blank space. Then 

80
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,230
we have three more options for the 

81
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,390
color of the sphere with which the whole 
thing 

82
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,290
begins. And then there are only 

83
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,110
two options for the variation 

84
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,990
behind it. 

85
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,270
In other words , if we think about it 
logically 

86
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,770
, we end up with a number of 24, which 
means 

87
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,530
that there are 24 ways to 

88
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,170

89
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,470

90
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,150
distribute these three balls with 
different colors over four spaces. 

91
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,550
Of course, the whole thing can also be 

92
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,890
described using combinatorics. Yes, 

93
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,630
that would have been the factorial 

94
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,870
of 4 here and that would also have been 
24. 

95
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,290
But next we ask ourselves, we 

96
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,490
now have three balls of the same 

97
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,790
color and want to distribute them over 
four 

98
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,450
places. In principle, 

99
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,370
this is exactly the same task, except 

100
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,130
that we now have three balls of the 

101
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,150
same color. 

102
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Let's imagine that all the balls here 

103
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,170
are the same color and that we 

104
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,750

105
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,410
can 't tell them apart. Yes, that 

106
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,890
would mean that these are all the 

107
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,650
same cases for us. All three 

108
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,810
come one after the other, with a 

109
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,610
space in front of them. This means that we 

110
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,010
can now only move this 

111
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,350
blank space. So there are 

112
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,370
now only four possibilities. 

113
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,230
And this can be calculated by 

114
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,570
dividing the factorial of 4 by the 

115
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,990
factorial of 3 times the factorial of 

116
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,410
1. And so we have 

117
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,590

118
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,570
calculated nothing more than the binomial 
coefficient 4 over 3. And the 

119
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:19,570
binomial coefficient only 

120
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,610
indicates how many possibilities there are 
to 

121
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,430

122
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,810
achieve k hits in n attempts. So if we use 
this again 

123
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,770
as an example, we would 

124
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:39,010
draw a ball four times, we have 

125
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,230
, let's say... Red balls and 

126
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,210
white balls. The white balls 

127
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,230
now appear here, let's say, as 

128
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,190
invisible. Then we can 

129
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,090
draw a white ball first, then 

130
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,010
three red balls. Or we first draw a 

131
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,650
red one, then an invisible one, then 

132
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,050
two more red ones. Or we draw 

133
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,470
two red ones first, then the invisible 

134
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,150
one and then a red one. Or we 

135
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,010
first draw three red balls and then 

136
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,290
the invisible one. 

137
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,190
In other words, there are a total of four 
ways to 

138
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,510

139
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,430

140
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,410
get three red balls and one white ball 
when you draw four balls. And the whole 
thing can be 

141
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,350

142
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,910
determined using the Biomia F coefficient 
n over k. 

143
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,580
The term n over k is 

144
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,300
much more common, but you 

145
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,940
can also say k out of n. 

146
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,820
As I said, N is the number of trials 

147
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,720
we have or how often we 

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,540
perform the random experiment and K 

149
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,160
is the number of hits we 

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,640
want to have. 

151
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,550
This binary coefficient can 

152
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,630
also be solved by specifying, I'll 

153
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,430
write it next to it, that 

154
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,880
is nothing more than the factorial 

155
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,820
of N divided by K-factorial times 

156
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,780

157
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,900
n minus k and the 

158
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,340
factorial of that again. You can 

159
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,700
also 

160
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,360
solve such a binary coefficient manually. 
As you can see, this was also 

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,780
done. This 1 is simply made 

162
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,880
up of 4 minus 3. 

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,620
Now let's move on to the Bernoulli 

164
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,300
 chain. 

165
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,740
First things first. The most important 
thing is that 

166
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,600
Bernoulli's chain can only be used when 
drawing 

167
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
with a backward placement. 

168
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,340
This means that the probability 

169
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,440
must... remain constant, 

170
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,840
or the number of 

171
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,480

172
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,520

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,100
balls in the urn must 

174
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,480
also remain constant, for example, if you 
have an urn experiment. That's why 

175
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,880
pulling with putting back. As soon as the 

176
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,440
ball that was pulled out is not 

177
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,260
put back, you can 

178
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,000
no longer use the Benulli chain. 

179
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,080
You have to 

180
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,240
use a different distribution , which we 
will look 

181
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,140
at later. Furthermore, there are 

182
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,560
only two 

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,040
possibilities during the experiment. This 
means that we 

184
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,820
either have a hit or no 

185
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,340
hit, i.e. a blank. 

186
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,520
You often have to 

187
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,580
define this a little differently . 

188
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,400
For example, if there are red, blue and 
green balls 

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,460
and you want to know the 

190
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,440
probability of a 

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,580
red ball, then a red ball is 

192
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,420
a hit. And if you 

193
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,200
draw a green or a blue ball, 

194
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,960
neither is a hit. You 

195
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,420
just have to simplify this so 

196
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,980

197
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,080
that you can apply the Benulli chain 
accordingly. Here we see the 

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,400
Benulli chain. Here we have 

199
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,020
our BMI coefficient, which we 

200
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,800
have just described. This 

201
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,860
indicates how many possibilities 

202
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,640
there are to 

203
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,140

204
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,440
achieve this constellation of N and K, 
i.e. of attempts and hits. P is the 

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,500
individual probability 

206
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,180
of the event. So, for example, 

207
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,620
if we look at the throw of the dice 

208
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
, it would simply be 1 sixth. K 

209
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,980
is the number of hits and N is 

210
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,800
the length of the chain, i.e. the length 

211
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,280
of the Bernoulli chain, or 

212
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,580
the number of attempts. And as 

213
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,100
I said, this binomial coefficient 

214
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,820
indicates how many possibilities 

215
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,560

216
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,200
there are for the number of hits to occur. 

217
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,700
What is very important here is that the 

218
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,280
Bernoulli chain unfortunately 

219
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,980
only ever calculates the probability for 

220
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,840
P of X equals K. In other words, the 

221
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,020
Bernoulli chain calculates the 

222
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,660
probability for exactly K 

223
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,720
hits. So, if we 

224
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,140
use 3 for K , the result is the 

225
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,600
probability of exactly K 

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,300
hits. This is why we often have to use 

227
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,860

228
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,960
Bernoulli's formula or Bernoulli's 

229
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,620
 chain more often in some tasks.  If we 

230
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,220
have something like one or two 

231
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,300
hits, then we have to 

232
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,760

233
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,740
calculate the probability of one hit, i.e. 
K equals 1, and 

234
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,200
the probability of two 

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,540
hits, i.e. K equals 2. Here is 

236
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,180
an example. 

237
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,260
There are ten nails in a box. 

238
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,160

239
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,040
The nail is broken with a probability of 
10%. What is the 

240
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,560
probability of 

241
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,640
finding two broken nails out of ten? 

242
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,460
That is, we pull 10 nails 

243
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,280
out of it. That is simply the number 

244
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,240
of our attempts, our n. And we 

245
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
want to know the 

246
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,860
probability of 2 broken 

247
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,280
nails. That's why our k is 

248
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,360
equal to 2. Our p, the 

249
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,940
probability, is, it 

250
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,140
already says probability of 10%, 

251
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,700
so 10%, important, please always 

252
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,180
enter this in decimal, for 

253
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,680
example 0.1. And so we get 

254
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,740
10 over 2 times 0.1 to the power of 2. 
times 1 minus 

255
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,720
0.1 to the power of 10 minus 2. So simply 

256
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,960
our k at a 2, so we get a 

257
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,500
power of 2 here. Here we had n minus 

258
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
k, so that's 10 minus 2 for us. 

259
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,920
And we can then enter this in the 

260
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,040
calculator . If the 

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,900
calculator cannot 

262
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,920
calculate binomial coefficients 

263
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
, you have to 

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,480

265
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,320
use the corresponding transformation that 
I showed earlier. 

266
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Now we come to the special cases. 

267
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,340
The Bernoulli formula 

268
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,260
only ever deals with the 

269
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,720
probability of exactly K 

270
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,160
 hits. I 

271
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,380
have already said  that. I'll say it 

272
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,560
again anyway because it' 

273
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,580
s really important. 

274
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,460
However, many problems require the 
probability 

275
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,760
of at most K hits or the 

276
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
probability of at least K 

277
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,980
 hits. And if you 

278
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,800
have a task like this , unfortunately you 
can't 

279
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,240
just use the Benulli formula 

280
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,060
and simply enter n, p and k. 
Unfortunately, you can only 

281
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,800
of . 

282
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,900
Unfortunately, you can then only calculate 
the probability for 

283
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,920
the individual event. And if we 

284
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,800

285
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,940
want the probability for a maximum of k 
hits, then you 

286
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,060

287
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,500
need the probability for all 

288
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,800
possible hits from 0 up to 

289
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,200
and including K. In other words, if it 

290
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,460
says a maximum of 3 hits, then 

291
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,600
it is the probability for 0 

292
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,720
hits plus the probability 

293
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,500
for 1 hit plus the 

294
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,600
probability for 2 hits plus 

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,080
the probability for 3 hits. 

296
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,600
And that is, as I said, that you 

297
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,980

298
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,440

299
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,100

300
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100

301
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,340
add up the probability of exactly K hits 
for each integer value of K, i.e. 0, 1, 2 
and 3 in the example I just gave. This 
means that you have to 

302
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,800
apply the Bernoulli chain four times 

303
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,020
or the Bernoulli formula. The 

304
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,300
results are then simply 

305
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,860
added up. The term or 

306
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,460
the wording at least K hits 

307
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,480
includes all possible hits from K 

308
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,340
to N, i.e. up to the 

309
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,420
end of the interval. So if you say 

310
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,920
at least 5 hits on 7 

311
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,360
attempts, this means that you want the 

312
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,780
probability of 5 

313
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,360
hits plus the probability 

314
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,040
of 6 plus the probability of 

315
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,360
7. This means that if 

316
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,580
you 

317
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,700
want to use the Bernoulli chain, you need 
the 

318
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,040
probability for each 

319
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,700
integer value of k and add it 

320
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,780
up at the end. The 

321
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,160
sign in front here is nothing more than 
the 

322
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,460
summation sign. We 

323
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,580
simply want to have the sum of i equals 

324
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,440
k to n of p of x equals i. So, 

325
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,620
to 

326
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,680
use the example from just now. You want at 
least 5 

327
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,980
hits with n equal to 7, then it is 

328
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,900
the sum of i equal to 5 to 7. Then 

329
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,500
it would be p of x equal to 5 plus p of x 

330
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,940
equal to 6 plus p of x equal to 7. And 

331
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,740
these three individual Bernoulli 

332
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,980
 formulas or Bernoulli chains 

333
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,000
would then have to 

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,340
be calculated accordingly and also 

335
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,020
all added together at the end . This is 
what this 

336
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,080
summation sign specifies. This is, of 
course, 

337
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,180
rather pointless. 

338
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,240
Many of you are probably 

339
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,140
already familiar with the cumulative 

340
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,420
probability, which we will come to 

341
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,140
in a moment. But what is very important 

342
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,300
is the relationship between 

343
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,360
probability and 

344
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,880
counter-probability. 

345
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,720
We know that the 

346
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,540
probability of the event plus 

347
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,080
the probability of its 

348
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,940
counter-event, i.e. p of x plus p 

349
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,500
of x², is always equal to 1. This means 
that 

350
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,140
if we 

351
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,400
take the dice roll again, we roll the dice 
once, 

352
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,500
let's say x is the event 

353
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
that a 4 comes up and x² 

354
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,620
is simply the event that no 4 

355
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,080
comes up. And I think it's clear 

356
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,940
that the probability is 100%, 

357
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,320
because when you roll the dice, 

358
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,460
either a 4 or no 4 comes up. 

359
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,260
Nothing else happens. And that's why 

360
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,040
you can 

361
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,280
convert at least K hits to at most K hits. 

362
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,600
We'll see why in a moment. 

363
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,560
First, let's see how it 

364
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,020
works . The 

365
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,940
term at least k hits 

366
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,080

367
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,500
does not include all possible hits from 0 
to k-1. In other words, 

368
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,260
let's take the example from 

369
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,000
just now again , we want at least 5 

370
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,580
hits with n equal to 7. This means 

371
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,140
that all hits from 0 to 

372
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,760
4 inclusive 

373
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,180
are not included. And we also know that 
the 

374
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,500
sum of both 

375
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,720
probabilities, i.e. the 

376
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,280
probability of at most 4 

377
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
hits and the probability 

378
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,420
of at least 5 hits, is 1. This 

379
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,360
can then be transformed into the 

380
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,300
probability of at least K 

381
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,900
hits, i.e. i equals k to n. 

382
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,520
At least K hits is 

383
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,000
then equal to 1 minus the 

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,300
probability of 0 to K-1 

385
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,460
 hits. This is very important. If 

386
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,520
you 

387
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,800
form the counter probability , you always 
have this K-1 

388
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,540
in there. Because we have 

389
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,840
already fulfilled our event with 5 hits. 

390
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,480
That's why the maximum limit 

391
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,140
for the 

392
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,060
counter probability is 4 hits. That's why 

393
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,440
we have a K-1 here. And so 

394
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,220
we now have ... from the wording 

395
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,160
at least K hits, which is 

396
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,500
transformed in such a way that we 

397
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,340

398
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,860
 insert or 

399
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,420
calculate the probability for at most K 
hits here. But by 

400
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,860
forming the counter probability, 1 

401
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,000
-, we have finally 

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400

403
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,760
determined the probability of at least K 
hits. In words, 

404
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,520
this simply means what is written above. 
The 

405
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
probability of at least K 

406
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,560
 hits is equal to 1 minus the 

407
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,980
probability of at most K 

408
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
 hits, i.e. the 

409
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,720
counter probability. And we 

410
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,780
are of course using 

411
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,040
the 

412
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,880
probability of at most K 

413
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,380
hits here for a very specific reason , 
because this is the so-called 

414
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,720
cumulative probability. 

415
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860

416
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,440
There are also 

417
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,760
tables for this cumulative probability and 
that is also the reason 

418
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:31,960
why we use the K hits 

419
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,140
, because we 

420
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,760

421
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,140
can then read the probability from a table 
and 

422
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,640

423
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,360
calculate the probability with at least. 
As I said, this is 

424
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
a very special 

425
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,680
probability function. This is 

426
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,620
the cumulative probability. 

427
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,100
This is 

428
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,120
stored in most calculators 

429
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,320
and 

430
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,560

431
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,140
can also be found in many math books at 
the end of the book. We have 

432
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,340
illustrated it here. We have exactly K 

433
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,720
 hits here , i.e. this is the 

434
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,800
individual probability. And here we 

435
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,980
have the cumulative 

436
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,620
probability for a maximum of K 

437
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,460
 hits. We have 

438
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,060
done the whole thing for a K of 0 to 5. We 

439
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,140
can see that for a K of 0, the individual 
probability is 

440
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,400
59.049%. The 

441
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,180
probability for K equal to 1 is 

442
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,720
32.805. If we look at 

443
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
the cumulative 

444
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,700
probability, we 

445
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,220
first see that the probability of 0 

446
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,820
is the same. This is simply due to 

447
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,440
the fact that the probability 

448
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,720
of 0, you can't 

449
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,500
add anything up yet. But if I 

450
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,080
say I want to 

451
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,000
have at most 0 hits , then there is only 
one 

452
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,340
possibility, that is 0. 

453
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,340
But if I say I want to 

454
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,820
have at most one hit, then it is simply 

455
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,740
the probability of 0 hits 

456
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,260
plus the probability of one 

457
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,940
hit. And that's why it says 

458
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,820
91, which is nothing 

459
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,400
more than 59.049 plus 32.805 

460
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,500
. It's the same if you say 

461
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,180
at most two hits. Then we have 

462
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,280
99.144% here. That is then 59. 

463
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,340
049% plus 32.805% plus 7.290%. 

464
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,680
And that goes on and on. 

465
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,820
Therefore, if, for example, we 

466
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,120
have n equal to 5 and if we 

467
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,880
set k equal to 5, then the 

468
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,780
cumulative probability 

469
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,700
is of course 100%. Because if we 

470
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,980
 run a 

471
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,940
test experiment 5  times 

472
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,680
, the probability that an event will 

473
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,380
occur at most 5 times is 100%. Because 

474
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,720
at most 5 times means from 0 times 

475
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,080
to 5 times. And this means that 

476
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,560
if the K is equal to N, all 

477
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,240
probabilities are taken into account . And 
that's why 

478
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,700
you end up with 100%. And using 

479
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,000
such tables, you can 

480
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,920
of course also 

481
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,140

482
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,640
solve such minimum tasks very effectively. 

483
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,160
Let's move on to a few text problems that 

484
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,380

485
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,940
are very difficult at first glance. These 
are... such 

486
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,120
three times minimum tasks. These are 

487
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,680
very popular exam problems because 

488
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,060
they are actually quite easy 

489
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,120
to calculate, but it 

490
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,580

491
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,660
is very difficult to set up the equation 
or find the approach. Because we 

492
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,000
have the task, there 

493
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,140
are 100 balls in a box , including 

494
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,060
two red ones. How often do you have to 

495
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,900
draw at least 

496
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,220

497
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,620
one ball in order to 

498
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,380
achieve at least one hit with a 
probability of at least 99 percent ? it's 
all very 

499
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,500
complicated and you have 

500
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,660
at least three times and whenever you 

501
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,400
have a task like this, you won 

502
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,860
't be 

503
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,880

504
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,560
able to fully understand it the first time 
you read it and work out the approach 
straight away. as a 

505
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,460
rule, you have to read it several times 

506
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,660
and then it works a bit 

507
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,580
better. that's why we're going to go 

508
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,360
step by step for now. 

509
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,460
first of all, we'll think about 

510
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,560
at least one So how to find 

511
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,840
the formula for at least k hits again . 

512
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,140
And we could transform it 

513
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,540
into at most k hits. If we 

514
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,520
transform this form at least k hits 

515
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,860
to at most k hits, 

516
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,060
we have, that is 1 minus from 0 to 

517
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,000
k minus 1 of the function p of x equals 

518
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,160
i. And behind this is now 

519
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,880
of course for this 

520
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,260
probability x equals i. is 

521
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,720
simply our Benullikette. So 

522
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,640
we simply get 1 minus the sum of 

523
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,380
i equals 0 to k minus 1 of n 

524
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,720
over i times p to the power of i times 1 
minus p 

525
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,360
to the power of n minus i. So everywhere 
where 

526
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,620
a k would actually be now, there is 

527
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,620
now an i, simply because we 

528
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,800
have defined it as i down here. And that 

529
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,160
may still seem quite 

530
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,620
tangled and very difficult, but 

531
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,420
our k is actually 1. And 

532
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,020
if we now calculate k minus 1, 

533
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,240
i.e. 1 minus 1, we have a 0. 

534
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,200
It's already there, the k has 

535
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,320
finally been inserted here. 

536
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,960
We have 1 minus 1 here. This means 

537
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,400
that we have the sum of i equals 0 to 0. 

538
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,200
And there is only one possibility, 

539
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,720
an integer, and that is 0. This 

540
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,860
means that we only have to 

541
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,860
consider one probability, that 

542
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,180
is the probability for 0. And so we arrive 
at 

543
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,020
1 minus n over 0 times p to the power of 0 
times 1. 

544
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,080
1-p to the power of n-0. So 1-p in 
brackets, 

545
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,620
the whole thing to the power of n-0. And 
now it is 

546
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,480
very important that n 

547
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,760
over 0 is simply 1. 

548
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,150
p to the power of 0, something to the 
power of 0 is also 

549
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,870
1. And 1-p to the power of n-0 is simply p 

550
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,030
to the power of n. And that makes it look 

551
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,770
much nicer. That means 

552
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,990
everything summarized, 1 times 1 times 

553
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,210
the parenthesis, then we can simply 

554
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,630
drop the two ones, 

555
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,710
because multiplying by 1 

556
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,510
doesn't change anything, because then 1 
minus 

557
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:34,290
the parenthesis is 1 minus p to the power 
of n. And 

558
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,310

559
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,710
we already know the probability of this 
event, namely 

560
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,330
99%. We 

561
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,170
also know our p and our n. Also. 

562
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,650
Sorry, the n is wanted, 

563
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,430
so we don't know that, but we do 

564
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,970
know our p. That was the 0 

565
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,130
.02, because we know that p is 0.02 

566
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,210
and so we get 1 minus, 

567
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,250
brackets open, 1 minus 0.02, brackets 

568
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,590
closed, to the power of n. That should 
equal 0.99 

569
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,610
. As 

570
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,670
I said, 1 minus 0.02 is in the parenthesis 
and only the 

571
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,630
parenthesis is raised to the power of n, 
so 

572
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,390
we can 

573
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,750
carry out this arithmetic operation, which 
is then 0.98 to the power of n. 

574
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,210
And this is now a very simple 

575
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,670
exponential equation that we 

576
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,550
can solve . Therefore, in the 

577
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,510
next step , we simply calculate plus 0.98 

578
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,610
to the power of n and minus 0.999, i.e. 
0.99 and 

579
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,730
then 0.01 is equal to 0.98 to the power of 

580
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,710
n. 

581
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,790
We now solve this exponential equation 

582
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,430
by applying the logarithm . The 

583
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,110
logarithm to the base 0.98 is used here 

584
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,630
, which is simply based on the 

585
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,750
logarithmic laws of arithmetic, so 

586
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,390
we end up with 

587
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:52,270
the logarithm of 0.98 

588
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,090
, sorry n is equal to the 

589
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,310
logarithm to the base 0.98 of 0.01 

590
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,590
and if we enter this in the calculator 

591
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,370
, the logarithm to the base 0 

592
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,790
.98 8 of 0.01, we get 228. 

593
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,630
But  this is also the same as the 

594
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,920
logarithm of 0.01 by the 

595
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,360
logarithm of 0.98. If someone 

596
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,940
doesn't know how to change the base, 

597
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,620
you can enter it just as well, 

598
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,340
the result will also be 228 rounded. And 

599
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,860
that completes the task 

600
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,560
. 

601
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,950
Now let's move on to the case that I 

602
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,090
briefly touched on at the beginning, that 

603
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,270
we have the case that we draw 

604
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,550
without putting back. In other words, I 

605
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,710
said that 

606
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,650
we can only use the Benulli chain when 
drawing with 

607
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,270
putting back. However, there is 

608
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,250
often also the case that we draw without 

609
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,910
putting back. And 

610
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,390

611
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,610
we can now see the probability function 
that we need here. This is 

612
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,570
a so-called 

613
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,930
hypergeometric distribution. And it 

614
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:07,150
is still a... And this is 

615
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,610
the formula for it. All these 

616
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,790
brackets are also 

617
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,270
binomial coefficients. You can see that 

618
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,830
a large n 

619
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,350
and an r have been added to the n and the 
k. And the 

620
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,250
probability p of x equals k, 

621
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,430
i.e. this is 

622
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,330
still a 

623
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,830
single probability, is r 

624
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,270
over k times n minus r over n minus k. 

625
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,790
The whole thing divided by large n over 

626
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,530
n. Let's start with 

627
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,450
n and k, i.e. small n 

628
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,490
and small k. Small n is 

629
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,130
also the number of nails 

630
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,450
taken from a box, i.e. 

631
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,170
the sample size if you like. 

632
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,030
The small k is the number of 

633
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,890
hits in the sample size, the 

634
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,210
largest n. So n and k 

635
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,490
do not change. k is still the 

636
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,210
number of hits and n is the chain length 

637
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,250
or sample size. But large 

638
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,130
N is the total number of all nails in 

639
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,470
a box, i.e. the total number 

640
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,890
of all possible events, if you 

641
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,570
like. The small R is the 

642
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,030
number of broken nails 

643
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,610
that can lead to a hit, i.e. the 

644
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,570
number of possible hits. 

645
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,590
We have 

646
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,190
filled in the whole thing again with an 
example. 

647
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,670
There are 200 nails in a box, including 

648
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,230
20 broken nails. What is 

649
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,530
the probability of 

650
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,350

651
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,990
finding exactly 3 broken nails among 10 
nails ? The first thing to do is to 

652
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,370
define all the parameters, i.e. 

653
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,850
large N, small N, R and K. We have 

654
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,770
just said that small N is 

655
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,090
still our sampling accident 

656
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,210
or the number of our trials. This 

657
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,930
is simply 10 in this case. We 

658
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,190
want the probability of 

659
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,890
exactly 3 broken nails, i.e. 3 

660
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,670
hits, so K is 3. We 

661
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,390
know that there 

662
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,550
are 200 nails in the box , so 

663
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,090
n equals 200, the total number. 

664
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,770
And we know that 

665
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,890
20 of these 200 nails are broken. This is 
the 

666
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,310
number 

667
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,570
of nails 

668
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,790
that could lead to a hit , i.e. 20. And 

669
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,130
we simply enter this into our 

670
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,850
formula. We arrive at 20 over 

671
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,410
3 times 200 minus 20. over 10 minus 3 

672
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,830
divided by 200 over 10. 

673
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,650
I wouldn 't 

674
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,050
enter that in the calculator. I would 

675
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,170
always 

676
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,910
carry out these simple arithmetic 
operations here first. So we arrive at 20 
over 

677
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,850
3 times 180 over 7 divided by 200 

678
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,530
over 10 and that is 5.48%. And 

679
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,930

680
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,130

681
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,290

682
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,850
in this way, you can also solve such 
problems where you are working with 
targets without setting back 

683
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,190
. These 

684
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,730
occur quite often and generally 

685
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,770
only lead to confusion at first, but they 

686
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,950
are actually not particularly 

687
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,290
difficult if you know the solution, 

688
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,590
or the solution is 

689
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,690
actually easy to understand. 

690
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,770
On the one hand, we want the 

691
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,770
probability of K hits and 

692
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,590
we specify the positions, i.e. at 

693
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,550
a defined position. Then the 

694
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,910
probability for hits at 

695
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,410
a position for the first time. times. 

696
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,730
In other words, we say we 

697
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,230
want to 

698
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,030
have hits from this position. And finally, 
the 

699
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,790
probability of K hits up to 

700
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,130
a certain position. So 

701
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,150
exactly the opposite of the 

702
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,550
case above. Good. 

703
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,490
Let's illustrate the whole thing with 
another example. 

704
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,790
We have a box that consists of 

705
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,390
100 nails and 20 of them are 

706
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,070
broken. And we remove 10 nails. 

707
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,930
And the question we ask ourselves... 

708
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,010
is how high is the 

709
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,690
probability 

710
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:53,090
of drawing exactly three broken nails we 
have 

711
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,750
not specified anything at this point , 
i.e. 

712
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,210
this is a completely normal benulli 

713
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,230
chain, i.e. 10 over 3 times 0.2 to the 
power of 

714
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,210
3 times bracket to 1 minus 0.2 bracket 

715
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,830
to the power of 10 minus 3, i.e. the 

716
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,230
probability of exactly three 

717
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,290
broken nails in this scenario 

718
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,870
is 20.13%. 

719
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,590
Now let's ask the question a little 
differently. 

720
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,730
We now want to know the 

721
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,670
probability that the 

722
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,850
first, fourth and sixth nail 

723
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,950
is broken. And now something 

724
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,590
very interesting happens . 

725
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,190
We now specify the order. And 

726
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,150
the moment we specify the order 

727
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,410
, the 

728
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,810
binomial coefficient is no longer 
applicable because there is only 

729
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,570
one variant and that is this 

730
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,070
order. So we say quite 

731
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,990
clearly that we want it in first, 

732
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,270
fourth and sixth place. And there 

733
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,070
is only one possibility, 

734
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:46,830
so the 

735
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,170
binomial coefficient is dropped. 

736
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,430
But the rest remains the same. So 0.2 to 
the power of 3 

737
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,130
times brackets to 

738
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,630
the power of 1 minus 0.2 brackets to the 
power of 10 minus 3. That's 0 

739
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,050
.17%. You will always 

740
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,350

741
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,770
have very small probabilities , but they 
are always correct. 

742
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,370
So you really only get small 

743
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,730
probabilities, because it is 

744
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,390

745
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,230
quite unlikely that you will predict the 
position 

746
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,350
. 

747
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,060
Let's move on to the next case, 

748
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,620
namely the probability that 

749
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,980
a 

750
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,300
hit will occur for the first time at 
position X. 

751
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,840
Again, let's take the example of our 

752
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,120
box, which consists of 100 nails and 

753
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,560
20 are broken. 

754
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,280
Again, we draw 10 nails and the question 

755
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,180
is, what is the 

756
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,140
probability that 

757
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,200
a broken 

758
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,180
nail will occur for the first time on the 
third move ? The first time on the 

759
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,980
third pull actually means 

760
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,560
that the first two nails 

761
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,200
are whole and the third nail is broken. 

762
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,760
And that's exactly what we calculate. 
Because 

763
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,240
we are already 

764
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,680
specifying the order of the first three 
moves, 

765
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,220
the binomial coefficient is no longer 
required. We 

766
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,700
say that 

767
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,940
a broken nail occurs for the first time on 
the third move 

768
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,040
. This 

769
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,900
determines the sequence. This means that 
the first and 

770
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,520
second nails must be intact and the 

771
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,620
third must be broken. Everything that 

772
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,220
comes after that doesn't matter, because 
it 

773
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,520
doesn't say how many nails 

774
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,480
should be broken in total. We 

775
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,280
only have the information... that 

776
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,640
the first broken 

777
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,200
nail 

778
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,100
should be pulled on the third pull. And so 
we 

779
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,000
simply have 0.2 to the power of 1 times 1 
minus 0.2 

780
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,860
to the power of 2. So that's for the one 

781
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,260
broken nail on the third 

782
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,660
pull and that's simply for the 

783
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,860
two intact nails. And that brings 

784
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,880
us to 12.8%. 

785
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,480
The third case is that we 

786
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,880
have to calculate the probability 

787
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,180
that we 

788
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,680
have K hits up to a certain position X. 
And this 

789
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,920
is actually a very simple 

790
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,720
task if you are clear about 1 

791
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,780
. We 

792
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,180
still have the same example with 

793
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,200
the 100 nails, 20 of which are broken. 

794
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,880
We continue to draw 10 nails, but 

795
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,800
we now want to 

796
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,440
try to get exactly 3 broken nails out of 
the first 5. 

797
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,720
And the only thing we 

798
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,840
do now is shorten our length. so 

799
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,140
we shorten the length of the benulli 

800
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,940
chain to 5, which means we 

801
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,480
no longer calculate with n equal to 10 but 

802
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,160
only with n equal to 5 if you 

803
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,200
like. this chain length is 

804
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,480
then also called m, which is the 

805
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,860
shortened chain length because we 

806
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,780
simply say we now only draw five 

807
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,100
nails and want to have three broken ones 

808
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,540
, so we come to 5 over 3 times 

809
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,660
0.2 to the power of 3 times 1 minus 0.2 to 
the power of 5 

810
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,040
minus 3. it is very important that 

811
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,480
the 5 is also used here. That is then 

812
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,800
5.12%. The probability is 

813
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,480
of course correspondingly lower than 

814
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,940
with n equal to 10, simply because the 

815
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,780
sample size is smaller, 

816
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,100
or in this case only 

817
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,640
half as large. 

818
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,290
Let's 

819
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,710
quickly summarize the formula again. The 

820
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,470
probability of getting K 

821
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,770
 hits at a defined 

822
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:16,150
position is simply calculated by 

823
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,770
multiplying p to the power of k by 1 minus 
p to the power of n minus k. 

824
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,810
The only important thing is that the 

825
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,190
positions are predefined and that 

826
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,710
you then count the number of hits 

827
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,330
and the number of attempts. So k 

828
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,790
is still the number of hits. 

829
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,370
In our example, we had 3 and 

830
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,250
n was simply 10 

831
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,190
attempts . And you can 

832
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,590
calculate it like this. 

833
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,430
As I said, the binomial coefficient is 
omitted here because the 

834
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,450
sequence is clear. There is only 

835
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:46,170
one possibility. The second example 

836
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,050
was about hitting at position 

837
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:52,770
X for the first time. This means 

838
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,310
that an 

839
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,510
order is also indirectly specified here. 
Very importantly, 

840
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,210
our 

841
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,070
N is now position X. 

842
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,410
In other words, we had the example of 

843
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,930

844
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,950
first carrying out a capacity test at the 
third position . 

845
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,890
that's why we had k11 as k11 

846
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,310
and n as 3, so we ended up with p 

847
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,970
to the power of 1 times 1 minus p to the 
power of 2. the 

848
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,340
third variant was that you 

849
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,400

850
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,760
have k hits up to the specific position x. 
Here you simply 

851
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,320

852
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,000
call the shortened interval m , just so 
that you 

853
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,200
finally 

854
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,380
get confused with the small ones , you use 
an m here and the 

855
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,900
formula for this is then simply m 

856
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,500
over k times p to the power of k times 1 
minus p 

857
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,320
to the power of m minus k. As I said, m is 

858
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,860
then simply the position x, so we 

859
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,980
just had up to the fifth 

860
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,660
position, which is why m was 5 for us 

861
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,900
and k is still the number of 

862
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,440
hits and p the probability 

863
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,180
for the individual event. It is very 
important 

864
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,280
that m is also used here. 

865
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,160
Well, we have now reached the end of the 

866
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,120
webinar. I hope you have... 

867
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,160
enjoyed the webinar and thank you 

868
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,260
very much for your 

869
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,040
attention.
