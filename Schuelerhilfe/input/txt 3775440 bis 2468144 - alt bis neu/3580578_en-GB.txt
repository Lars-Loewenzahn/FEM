00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,790
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,450
Schülerhilfe webinar on counting and 

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,370
comparing. Today we want to 

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,890
take a look at how we count, 

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,630
then how we 

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,630
compare these numbers with each other , 
how we 

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,730
can arrange numbers and finally how we 

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,390
can also 

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,470
compare larger numbers with each other . 

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,830
But let's start with counting. To do this, 

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,010
we switch off the lips and 

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,950
count the stars in the sky. 

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,620
We count through. One star, two, 

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,340
three, four, five, six, seven, 

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,620
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, 

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,380
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen stars. 

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,280
How 

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,790
many different types of stars 

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,670
do we see? So we have these 

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,650
stars, one, then we have these 

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,410
stars, two and these stars. Three 

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,270
different types. These stars 

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,250
differ in the number 

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,850
of their points. Because these stars have 

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,330
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 points. These stars 

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,030
have 1, 2, 3, 4 points. And these 

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,470
stars have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 

28
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,670
points. Here we see it again. 

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,160
How many stars with 4 points do 

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,660
we see now? In other words, we now 

31
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,280
only count all the stars that 

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,600
have four points. So here we have one, 

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,100
here is another one, two, three, four 

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,180
and five. So you can see five stars 

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,040
with four points. How many 

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
stars with five points can we see 

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,800
? Count again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,920
6, 7, so we see seven stars 

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,080
with five points. Finally, let's 

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,300

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,260
count the stars with seven 7-pointed 
points . These are 1, 2, 3, 

42
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,280
so we see 3 stars with 7 points. 

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
We now know that we have 5 stars 

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,460
with 4 points, 7 stars with 5 points 

45
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,520
and 3 stars with 7 points. Which of 

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,580
the stars are the most common 

47
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,410
? These are the stars with 5 

48
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,390
points. We have seven of them. These 

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,170
are the most common. And which are 

50
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,210
the rarest? These are 

51
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,910
the stars with seven points. Because 

52
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,590
we have three of them. 

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,790
Let's switch the light on again. 

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,490
Because what we just did was 

55
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,630

56
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,590
compare the numbers. We asked the question 

57
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,550
, which type of star 

58
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,590
is the most common? So, which 

59
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,610
number is the largest? The 5, the 7 

60
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,330
or the 3? The answer is 

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,550
7, because it is bigger than 5 and 

62
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,630
bigger than 3. We can also see this on 

63
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,190
the number line. Because the larger a 

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,650
number is, the further to the right 

65
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,150
we can find it on the number line. 

66
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,070
We have the 3, we have the 5 and 

67
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,610
furthest to the right we have the 7. If we 

68
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,410

69
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,450
want to write it down mathematically , we 
write 7 for 7 is 

70
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,570
greater than 5, 7, then the angle 

71
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,010
bracket from the 7 to the 5. 

72
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,010
So the larger number has the 

73
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,630
open side of the bracket, the 

74
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,170
smaller number has the pointed end of the 

75
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,830
bracket. So 7 is greater than 5 or 7 

76
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,210
is greater than 3. 

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,270
We have a total of 5 

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,790
comparison signs. We have the 

79
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,070
equal sign. If two numbers 

80
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,410
are equal, for example 4 is 

81
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,890
equal to 4. Or 2 is equal to 2. Then 

82
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,390
the greater than sign. So 4 is 

83
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,130
greater than 2. 7 is greater than 5. 

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,350
We also have the less than 

85
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,970
sign. 2 is smaller than 4. 1 is 

86
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,690
smaller than 3. So we can 

87
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,330
remember that the sign always points to 
the 

88
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,850
smaller number. So the tip of the 

89
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,250
bracket always points to the bracket. 

90
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,770
the smaller number in this 

91
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,010
comparison. We also have 

92
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,270
the greater than or equal 

93
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,510
to sign and the less than or equal to 
sign, i.e. the 

94
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,950
corresponding angle bracket with 

95
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,010
a dash 

96
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,790
underneath , as with the equal sign. The 

97
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,190
sign means that the number, i.e. 

98
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,470
the greater than or equal to sign, means 

99
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,010
that the number is greater than or 

100
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,230
equal to. This means that 

101
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,130
the greater than or equal to sign applies 

102
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,530
to 4 is greater than or equal to 

103
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,190
2, but it also applies to 4 is greater 
than 

104
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,690
or equal to 4, because 4 equals 4 

105
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,470
. Exactly the same applies to the 

106
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,410
less than or equal sign. So 1 is 

107
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,970
less than or equal to 3, but 5 is also 

108
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,930
less than or equal to 5. 

109
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,440
We can use comparisons 

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,560
to arrange numbers. For example, from 

111
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,100
small to large or from large to 

112
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,340
small. We want to arrange the following 
numbers 

113
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,080
from small to large. 8, 5, 3, 6, 

114
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,620
2 and 5. First we look for the 

115
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,360
smallest number. This is the number that 

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,100
is furthest 

117
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,280
to the left on the number line. In our 
case, 

118
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,470
this would be 2. Next, we take 

119
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,150
the next smallest number, i.e. the 

120
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,950
number furthest to the left 

121
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,850
. 

122
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,670
So we write down 2 is smaller than 

123
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,810
3, is smaller than the next largest 

124
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,470
number, which is 5. Then we have 

125
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,870
another 5 in our 

126
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,150
number line. In other words, we 

127
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,230
write is less than or equal to 5, 

128
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,750
because 5 equals 5 

129
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,810
must also be valid. The next number we 

130
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,150
have is 6. That means we 

131
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,930
write is less than 6. And the 

132
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,570
largest number is 8. That means we 

133
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,030
end our sequence with is 

134
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,270
less than 8. 

135
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,490
Now we want to 

136
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,490
compare larger numbers with each other. 
Which number 

137
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,410
is larger? 2458. or 2131 

138
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,590
. To do this, we write the numbers 

139
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,850
one below the other and compare them 

140
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,510
digit by digit. We start with the 

141
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,710
highest digits, i.e. from left 

142
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,830
to right. First we compare 2 

143
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,670
and 2, which are the same. This means 

144
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,750
we 

145
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,990
continue with the next digit. The next 
digit is 4 and 

146
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,930
1. We now know from the number line that 

147
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,710
4 is greater than 1. If 4 

148
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,470
is greater than 1, we also know from this 
that 2468 

149
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,150
is greater than 2131. 

150
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,190
This means that we compare the 

151
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,510
individual 

152
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,090

153
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,150

154
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,890
digits until a comparison results in 
greater or less than and no longer equal 

155
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,150
. So in this case 

156
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,050
2468 

157
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,930
. And that brings us to the 

158
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,470
end of today's webinar 

159
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,050
. Thank you 

160
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,110
for your attention and have a 

161
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,850
nice day.
