Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,600
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,460
at Schülerhilfe. I'm pleased to explain 

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,200
the topic of oxidation and 

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,820
reduction to you today. In addition to 

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,300
this video, you can 

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,240
also find a 

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,780
wiki on this topic in our online learning 
center, 

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,740
where the most important terms 

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,960
and basics are explained. 

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,120
We encounter the processes of oxidation 
and reduction every day, for example in 

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,060
the form of combustion reactions or 

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,520
the rusting of metals. These two 

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,140
optically and kinetically very 

16
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,060
different processes are based on 

17
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,600
the reaction with oxygen. 

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,640
Oxidation and reduction are always 

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,040

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,580
associated with electron transfer. During 
a reduction, 

21
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,080
electrons are 

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,260
taken up by an atom, ion or molecule and 
the 

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,540
oxidation number, Oz, of the same is 

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,820
reduced. Reduction 

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,160
is always accompanied by 

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,820
oxidation, in which electrons 

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,120
are released. And this increases 

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,220
the oxidation number. The term 

29
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,160
oxidation was chosen because it 

30
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,680
often involves a reaction with 

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,760
oxygen and 

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,540
oxygen compounds 

33
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,160
are referred to as oxides . Oxidation and 

34
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,560
reduction are fundamentally 

35
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,960
coupled. This means that one 

36
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
cannot take place without the other. 

37
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,800
They belong together like the north 

38
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,740
and south poles of a magnet. 

39
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,620
Corresponding reactions are 

40
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,340
called redox reactions. In the following, 

41
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,640
I would like to explain a 

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,660
redox reaction that many people 

43
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,980
are probably already familiar with. It 

44
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,900
is the oxyhydrogen reaction, 

45
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,360
in which hydrogen 

46
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,260
reacts with oxygen to form water. The 

47
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,800
reactants of this reaction are 

48
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,260
elementary oxygen and 

49
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,900
hydrogen, both of which are biatomic 

50
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,520
, i.e. 

51
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,960
composed of two atoms , and 

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,860

53
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,800
have oxidation numbers of 0 , just like 
all elementary compounds . The 

54
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,620
oxidation numbers are written in 

55
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,560
Roman numerals above the elements, 

56
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,080
as you can see here in the illustration 

57
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,720
. Oxygen 

58
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,680
is the oxidizing agent that 

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,620
is itself reduced, as each 

60
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,900
oxygen atom takes 

61
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
up two electrons during the reaction to 
form water, 

62
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,440

63
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,660
reducing its oxidation number from 0 to 
minus 2. 

64
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,700
At the same time, hydrogen is 

65
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,340
oxidized. Each hydrogen atom gives 

66
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,200
up one electron, which increases the 

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,980
oxidation number from 0 to plus 1 

68
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,740
. In total, 

69
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,980

70
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,340
four electrons are 

71
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,880
transferred during this reaction, which 
produces two particles of water. The 

72
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
oxidation and reduction sub-processes 

73
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,980
can also be represented individually. For 
the 

74
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,260
reduction of one molecule of oxygen 

75
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,740
, four electrons are required, whereas 

76
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,900
two molecules 

77
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,220
of hydrogen must be used for oxidation . 
These 

78
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,220
two H2 particles give up 4 electrons 

79
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,600
. In order to 

80
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,800
write down the reaction equation of a 
redox reaction correctly, 

81
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,820
it is important to note that the 

82
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,180
number of 

83
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,040
electrons taken up in the oxidation 

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,420

85
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,600
corresponds to the number of electrons 
released in the reduction . 

86
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,040
To determine the oxidation number 

87
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,540
of an element in a 

88
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,320
 non-elemental compound, for 

89
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,660
example oxygen in a 

90
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,820
water molecule, it is usually sufficient 
to look at 

91
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,380
the periodic table. Elements of the 

92
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,840
first main group in 

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
compounds 

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,560
tend to give up an electron and therefore 
usually have an 

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,720
oxidation number plus 1. Elements of the 

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,240
second main group in 

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,340
compounds usually have an oxidation number 

98
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,860
plus 2. Third main group plus 3. 

99
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,120
Higher main groups have a 

100
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,260
higher electronegativity and 

101
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,300
tend to accept electrons 

102
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,100
in order 

103
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,960
to achieve the noble gas configuration. 
For example, halogens, which are 

104
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,400
in the seventh main group 

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,520
, usually have an oxidation number 

106
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,980
minus 1, elements in the sixth 

107
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,840
main group have an oxidation number minus 

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,820
2 and those in the fifth main group minus 

109
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,400
3. Carbon and the other 

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,020
elements in the fourth main group 

111
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,240
show very variable 

112
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,720
oxidation numbers in compounds , depending 
on the 

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,720
reactant. Knowledge of 

114
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,760
the oxidation numbers also helps 

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,500
when formulating the molecular formula for 

116
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,460
a compound. For example, water, 

117
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,360
which 

118
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,660
is outwardly electrically neutral, can 
only 

119
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,000
have the molecular formula H2O , as 
hydrogen has the 

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,260
oxidation number plus 1 and 

121
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
oxygen has the oxidation number minus 

122
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,660
2. So 2 times plus 1 plus 1 times minus 

123
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,820
2 equals 0. With this knowledge 

124
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,980
, let's take a look at another 

125
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,140
redox reaction, the formation of 

126
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,740
common salt, chemically sodium chloride, 

127
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,240
from the elements. 

128
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,760
As always, the elements have the oxidation 
number 0. 

129
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,840
Like all halogens, chlorine is bimolecular 

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,940
. As chlorine is in the seventh 

131
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,520
main group, it has 

132
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,720
an oxidation number of minus 1 in the 
compound 

133
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,660
, i.e. it is reduced. Sodium from 

134
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,280
the first main group gives 

135
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,340
up one electron at a time and is therefore 
oxidized. 

136
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,740
Two 

137
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,440
NaCl particles can be formed from one 
chlorine molecule , which is why two 

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,180
sodium atoms 

139
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,560
must be used. In total, only two 

140
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,760
electrons are transferred. The product 

141
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,940
sodium chloride is not 

142
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,720
a molecule, but ions that 

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,680

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,800
attract each other due to their different 
charges. 

145
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,620
Whether a salt 

146
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,640
is formed in a redox reaction or covalent 
compounds 

147
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,980
are formed does not play a role 

148
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,500
in the procedure for 

149
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,280
setting up the reaction equation. 

150
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,900
Taking into account the oxidation numbers 

151
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,440
and the number of 

152
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,320
electrons transferred , you can recognize 
reduction and 

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,540
oxidation and 

154
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,740

155
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,480
set up the corresponding reaction 
equations . I hope this video 

156
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,160
has 

157
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,360
contributed to your understanding of the 
topic of oxidation and enables 

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,280
you to set up 

159
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,700
reaction equations and 

160
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,120
summation formulas. 

161
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,840
As 

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,760
usual , you can find more content on this 
topic in our online learning center.
