00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,310
Welcome to the webinar on 

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,090
derivation rules. 

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,710
In this webinar , we will first look at 

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,170
what a derivation actually is and 

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,590
what we need 

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,890
derivation rules for , in particular 
higher 

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,530
or further derivation rules 

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,830
in addition to the normal derivation 

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,170
, which some of you may already 

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,970
know. These are the 

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,390
chain rule, the product rule and the 

12
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,810
percentage rule. 

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,770
We will look at these three derivation 
rules 

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:31,810
in this webinar and we 

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,850
will also go into more detail about them 

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,450
and of course 

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,790

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,610
demonstrate their application using 
examples. 

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,550
But first, let's take a look at what a 
derivative is. A 

20
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,910
derivative has the property that 

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,010
it 

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,550
can represent the slope at any point of a 
function, 

23
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,990
or the derivative indicates 

24
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,110
the slope at a point of 

25
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,570
a function. You can see 

26
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,290
a parabola here and you can also see 

27
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,230
parabolas or functions. 

28
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,190
Functions with a degree higher than 

29
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,270
1, i.e. all functions except degrees, 

30
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,530
have a gradient that 

31
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,530
is different at each point. This 

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,830
means that we can see here that the 

33
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,990
gradient is not constant, as is the 

34
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,570
case with a straight line, for example. 

35
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,130
And in order to 

36
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,410
calculate the gradient at a point, i.e. 
the 

37
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,150
instantaneous rate of change, we need 

38
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,130
the derivative. This can give us 

39
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,870
this instantaneous rate of change 

40
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,230
or the gradient... at this point, 

41
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,790
the difference is given in quotients 

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,590
as it 

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,190
was used for linear functions , i.e. slope 
strike 

44
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,990
or something like that only gives an 

45
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,210
average slope between 

46
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,150
two points and this application 

47
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,510
of degrees is of course only an 

48
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,290
approximation method and nothing 

49
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,010
mathematical we will 

50
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,850
look at how we 

51
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,590
use the derivative to 

52
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,140
calculate the slope at a point we 

53
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,080
first have a function f and x 

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,520
equal to x² plus 3x minus 1. And a 

55
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,060
typical task could 

56
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,280
be that we 

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,040

58
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,780

59
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,060
want to calculate the instantaneous slope 
or the instantaneous rate of change at the 
point x equal to 2 . 

60
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,960
As mentioned earlier, this is done using 
the first 

61
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,440
derivative. This means that we must 

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,780
first of all 

63
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,240
derive our function f from x. We need to 

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,800
create the first derivative f' of x. Even 

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
if it's not written here, 

66
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,900
I'll 

67
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,020
quickly explain again how to derive it. We 

68
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,300
see here that we have x² plus 3x 

69
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,900
minus 1 and if we 

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,140
want to derive this , x² derived is 2x, so 

71
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,620
simply 

72
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,120
multiply by the exponent and 

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,760
reduce the exponent by 1, i.e. 2 times x 
to the power of 

74
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,580
2 minus 1, 2 minus 1 is 1, so we 

75
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,260
have, if you like, 2x to the power of 1, 

76
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
the power of 1 is not included, which is 
why we 

77
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,340
simply write 2x and 

78
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,020
3x. When deriving, the x is simply 

79
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,060
dropped because it is no longer a power or 

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,500
because the power is a 1. And then 

81
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,520
you simply get a 3. Constants 

82
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,020
such as minus 1 are generally 

83
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,380
dropped completely when deriving. 

84
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,680

85
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,560
The first derivative of our function 

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,820
f from x is therefore 2x plus 3. 

87
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,580
And to 

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,820
calculate the gradient at the point x 
equals 2, we 

89
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,600
simply have to form f' from 2 or 

90
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,340
insert 2 for the x. We then 2. 

91
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,780
We then arrive at 2 times 2 plus 3. 2 
times 2 is 

92
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,700
4. 4 plus 3 is then 7. 

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,220
So we know that the gradient at point 2 

94
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,980
is 7. And this is exactly what 

95
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,680
we need the derivative for. 

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
Here is a small table of the 

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,180
most important derivatives. This is 

98
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,540
the general derivative that is 

99
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,540
always used. In other words, what I 

100
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,260
have just explained. If we have x 

101
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,740
to the power of n, then that's n times x 
to the power of n 

102
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,600
minus 1. So n is our exponent. 

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,620
We multiply by the exponent 

104
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,580
and then reduce it by 1. This is 

105
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,420
the most common derivation. 

106
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,960
Of course, it can also happen that 

107
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,220
the variable in the... denominator of a 

108
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,920
fraction 

109
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,980
, which is the case here, for example, you 
can also 

110
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,500
solve it with this method if you 

111
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,800
rearrange it appropriately, but here it is 

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
already shown once we had the 

113
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,500
derivative of 1 by x is minus 1 

114
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,260
by x squared, which is based 

115
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,180
on this , as I said, because 1 by x is 
nothing 

116
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,880
more than x raised to the power of minus 1 
and if 

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,980
you then derive it you get 

118
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,600
to minus x raised to the power of minus 2. 
And then 

119
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,120
we would be back to that again 

120
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,660
if you rewrite it. e raised to the power 
of x is 

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,340
something quite popular. There is also 

122
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,940
the e-function, which we will 

123
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,840
look at later. And e 

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,320
to the power of x is then derived from e 
to the power of x 

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,800
again. That's a nice thing. 

126
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,760
The square root of x is then equal to 1 

127
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,980
divided by the square root... 1 divided by 
2 times the square 

128
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,780
root of x, which is also based on this, 
can 

129
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,340
also be proven with this, 

130
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,540
because the square root of x is nothing 

131
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,140
more than x to the power of 0.5 or x to 
the power of 1 

132
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,580
.5. Then you also have the 

133
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,760
factor 1.5 and then you can 

134
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,740
rearrange it accordingly. The 

135
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,480
logarithm of x is derived 

136
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,980
by dividing 1 by x and we still have two 

137
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,800
trinometric functions. The sine 

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,560
of x becomes the cosine of x and the 

139
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,520
cosine of x becomes the minus sine of x. 

140
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,360
So why do we need any 

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,660
more derivation rules? We 

142
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,740
have already been able to determine some 
derivatives 

143
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,560
and we have 

144
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,940
just solved a 

145
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,700
problem in which we 

146
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,340
needed a derivative. The problem is 

147
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,580
that many functions 

148
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,880
are far more complex than what we 

149
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,980
have just solved. We have only just 

150
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,780
started with the derivative. 

151
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
I 

152
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
explained it briefly earlier in the E-Alts 
times tables. We 

153
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,160
will 

154
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,260

155
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,920
look at the chain rule, the product rule 
and the quotient rule. These are higher 

156
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,300
derivation rules that you need to 

157
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,420
derive functions. The 

158
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,620
basic arithmetic rules are now 

159
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,880
known. There is the 

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,320
sum rule and the factor rule. 

161
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,220
They are often not known by name 

162
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,820
, but everyone can 

163
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,960
apply them. The sum rule 

164
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,600
simply states that we have just 

165
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,540
applied it , if we have f 

166
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,940
of x equal to g of x plus h of x, 

167
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,680
i.e. we have two partial functions, 

168
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,920
then the derivative of these is nothing 

169
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,400
more than the individual derivatives 

170
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,880
added up again , i.e. subtracted. 

171
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,230
In other words, if we 

172
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,030
have, for example, f of x equal to 2x plus 
x² 

173
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,410
, then f' of x is the derivative of 2x 

174
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,230
plus the derivative of x². In other words, 

175
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,530
what we have just done. The 

176
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,330
factor rule is also always 

177
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,850
applied without much 

178
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,270
attention being paid to it. This is 

179
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,570
simply f of x is equal to c times g 

180
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,050
of x and the first derivative f' of 

181
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,530
x is then c times f' of x is equal to 

182
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,890
c times g' of x. This means 

183
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,130
that if we 

184
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,550
have a constant factor to multiply by, 

185
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,170
it is not derived separately, 

186
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,630
we simply multiply the 

187
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,330
derivative by it. 

188
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,000
We now have 

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
a small example of this here. 

190
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,180
We have the sine of x plus 4 times 

191
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,640
the logarithm of x. The sine 

192
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,820
of x is derived from the cosine of x. 

193
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,040
So here we have two 

194
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,380
partial terms that 

195
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,220
are separated by a plus. So 

196
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,800
the sum rule probably applies here. And 
you can see here 

197
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,920
with the logarithm, we have 4 times the 

198
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,220
logarithm of x. 

199
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,160
And the sine of x 

200
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,200
becomes the cosine of x and 4 

201
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,780
times the logarithm of x, the 

202
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,660
logarithm of x becomes 1 by x 

203
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,020
and the 4 remains simple, which is why 

204
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,340
we also have 4 times 1 by x. 

205
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,580
Of course, you could also add the 4 to 

206
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,270
the top of the numerator. Now we come 

207
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,950
to the first new 

208
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,210
derivation rule, which is the 

209
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,990
chain rule. The chain rule 

210
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,270
is always used when two 

211
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,890
functions 

212
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,870
are linked together . In other words, when 
you 

213
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,930
have an inner and an outer function. Here 

214
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,090
we have an example of this. 

215
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,770
We have 3 times x²-4 to the power of 5. We 
have 

216
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,730
an outer function, this bracket 

217
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,950
to the power of 5, and an inner function 
x²-4. 

218
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,110
And to 

219
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,950
derive this function, we need the 

220
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,370
chain rule. And the chain rule 

221
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,050
may seem 

222
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,410
a little difficult at first glance , but 
it's actually 

223
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,430
not as difficult as you might think. 

224
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,070
Most 

225
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,230
people know the mnemonic . It reads inner 
times 

226
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,290
outer derivative. In other words, we 

227
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,610
first derive the inner 

228
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,950
function and the outer function. And then 

229
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,950
we multiply the outer 

230
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,210
function by the derivative of the 

231
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,390
inner function . This means for our 

232
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,170
example. We still have the 

233
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,650
example f of x is equal to 3 times x² 

234
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,970
minus the whole to the power of 5. The 
inner 

235
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,190
function is, as already 

236
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,450
mentioned, what is in the parenthesis 

237
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,610
, i.e. x²-4. The outer function is 3 

238
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,510
times the parenthesis to the power of 5, 
i.e. 3x to the power of 

239
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,690
5. First, 

240
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,210
we derive both. x²-4 is 

241
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,150
derived from 2x. And 3x to the power of 5 
becomes 

242
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,770
5 times 3x or just the bracket to the 
power of 

243
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,910
4. 5 times 3, i.e. 15 times the bracket 

244
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,190
to the power of 4. That is the outer 
derivative. 

245
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,430
And as I said, the chain rule 

246
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,230
is as follows: f' of x is equal to 

247
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,130
v' of x times u' of v of x. This 

248
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,590
means that we first write 

249
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,190
down our v' of x, which is 2x. Then 

250
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,770
comes our u', i.e. the derivative 

251
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,530
of the outer function equation, which 

252
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,410
is 15 times... times the brackets to the 
power of 4 

253
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,610
and the outer derivative U' is 

254
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,230
then simply the normal inner 

255
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,870
function V of x, as we also 

256
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,690
find it here. This means that we 

257
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,850
arrive at 15 times, brackets open, now 

258
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,150
our normal inner 

259
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,410
function equation, which we 

260
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,230
already had earlier , i.e. x²-4, the 

261
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,610
whole thing to the power of 4, times the 
derivative of the 

262
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,890
inner function, i.e. times 2x. 

263
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,350
In principle, this is already the first 

264
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,970
derivative, but you can 

265
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,350
simplify it further , which you should 

266
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,910
always do. That means 15 

267
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,390
times 2x is 30x and you end up 

268
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,830
with 30x times x² minus 4 to the power of 
4. And 

269
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,650
that is ultimately the first 

270
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,630
derivative. We have 

271
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,730
another example here , where 

272
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,050
we have f from x equals 1 half times 
brackets 

273
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,550
to x² minus 3x. The inner 

274
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,470
functional equation here is x² 

275
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,750
-3x±1. The outer functional equation 

276
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,290
is 1.5 times the bracket to the power of 
3. And the 

277
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,450
first thing we do now is 

278
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,570
to determine v' from x and u' from x. 

279
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,970
The derivative of v' of x is then 

280
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:54,150
x² derived 2x-3x-2. 3. The 

281
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,950
derivative of u of x, i.e. u' of x, 

282
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,270
is then equal to 1 half times 3 and the 

283
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,210
bracket to the power of 2. This can be 

284
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,790
simplified again , 1 half times 3 are the 
3 

285
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,430
halves that are here. And if we 

286
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,190
now apply the chain rule again 

287
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,910
, we simply arrive at 3 

288
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,230
half times, so this is again the 

289
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,030
derivative of the outer 

290
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,750
function equation, brackets on x² 

291
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,870
minus 3x plus 1, which is the 

292
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,410
normal inner function that you 

293
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,450
have here above. The only important thing 
is to the power of 

294
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,130
2, times the derivative of the inner 

295
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,210
function, i.e. 2x minus 3. 

296
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,950
Of course, you could also 

297
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,870
simplify this. You could 

298
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,510
also add the 3 halves to the term, 

299
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,050
but this has not been done here. 

300
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,750
And that brings us to 

301
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,010
the product rule. The product rule 

302
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,790
must always be applied 

303
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,410
when a... a product 

304
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,390
is formed. In other words, when two terms 
that 

305
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,290
both contain the variable 

306
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,150
are multiplied together. 

307
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,590
Here you can see 3x² times 5x³-2x. This 
means 

308
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,090
that you have a function on the left and 

309
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,190
a function on the right and these two 

310
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,150
are multiplied. And that's why 

311
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:14,130
we need the product rule. With 

312
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,230
the product rule, as with the 

313
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,510
chain rule , you first have to 

314
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,930
write down the two functions, which are 
given 

315
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,690
the names u and v. 

316
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,270

317
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,990
It doesn't matter which of the two 
functions you call what , because no 

318
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,610

319
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,150
distinction is made here between inner and 
outer functions or between 

320
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,950
left and right 

321
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,970
function equations. 

322
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,750
It doesn't matter at all. So you can 
assign u and v of x 

323
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,730
however you like. We have 

324
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,210
called u of x 3x² in this case, i.e. 

325
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,110
the left-hand function, and v of x 5x 

326
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,930
to the power of 3 minus 2x, i.e. the 
right-hand function . 

327
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,490
Function. The product rule or the 

328
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,550
derivative using the product rule 

329
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,010
is then simply u' of x times v 

330
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,330
of x plus u of x times v' of x. This 

331
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,550
means that you always take one 

332
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,510
derivative times the other 

333
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:10,690
non-derivative. So u' times v of x plus 

334
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,910
u times v' of x. Always one 

335
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,750
derived and the other not 

336
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,690
derived. It's quite 

337
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,830
easy to remember and I think you can 

338
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,950
already see here that we first 

339
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,550
have to determine u' and v' again. 

340
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,930
We'll do that too. First, 

341
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,950
we take our u 

342
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,610
of x and our v of x and form the first 

343
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,650
derivative of both. 

344
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,190
We arrive at u' of x, 3x² is derived, 2 

345
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,230
times 3x, i.e. 6x. So V of X, 5X 

346
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,270
to the power of 3 minus 2X is derived 3 
times 

347
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,390
5X squared minus 2, 3 times 5X squared 

348
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,010
is 15X squared and the whole thing minus 

349
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,510
2. And 

350
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,230
we then simply insert this U dash, V dash, 
U and V into the 

351
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,350
formula, which is U dash 

352
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,990
times V plus U times V dash. In other 
words 

353
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,170
, we now insert everything as 

354
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,110
in the building block principle, 6X times 
brackets 

355
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,730
to the power of 5X. x to the power of 3 
minus 2x. 

356
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,950
Please make sure that whenever you 

357
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,230
have terms like this, you put a bracket, 
otherwise 

358
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,470
you will make a mistake. Plus 3x² times 

359
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,250
parentheses to 15x² minus 2 parentheses 
closed. 

360
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,450
This is basically the first 

361
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,350
derivative. 

362
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,490
Now you just have to take this first 
derivative , or you 

363
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,650
don't have to, it is, you could 

364
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,810
calculate with it, it's just very 

365
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,950
cumbersome and very messy and 

366
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,010
that's why you go after all... And 

367
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,490
simplify it as much as 

368
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,470
possible . In other words, we 

369
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,170
multiply 

370
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,030
out the two brackets . So 6x times 5x to 
the power of 3 and 6x times 

371
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:55,410
2. 6x times 5x to the power of 3 and 6x 
times minus 

372
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,570
2x. 3x² times 15x² and 3x² times minus 2. 

373
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,690
6x times 5x to the power of 3 is 30x to 
the power of 4. 6x 

374
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:13,430
times minus 2x is minus 12x. 3x² 

375
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,230
times 15x² is plus 45x to the power of 4 
and 3x² times 

376
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,910
minus 2 is minus 6x². As you can see, 

377
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,210
we have 30x to the power of 4 plus 45x to 
the power of 4 

378
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,030
is 75x to the power of 4. Minus 12x² minus 
6x² 

379
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,130
is minus 18x² and that is 

380
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,370
finally our first 

381
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,390
derivative. And so we have 

382
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,170
successfully calculated this... 
successfully 

383
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,210
calculated using the product rule. We 

384
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,510
also have another example here 

385
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,650
with an e-function. 

386
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,270
The special thing about e-functions is 
that you 

387
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,330
should always factor them out or 

388
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,930
try to factor them out. 

389
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,050
Here we have f is equal to brackets to the 

390
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,950
power of 1 .5 x minus 5x plus 3 brackets 

391
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,310
to times e to the power of x. Please pay 
attention even 

392
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,750
if this is in brackets, 

393
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,470
you don't need a chain rule, you 

394
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,990
only need the product rule so you 

395
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,470
simply take the left function as 

396
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,150
u of x and the right one as v of x 

397
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,510
you can also choose the other way round 
this 

398
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,270
doesn't change the result we have 

399
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,070
done it this way that means u of x is 

400
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,710
equal to half x to the power of 3 minus 5x 

401
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:27,390
plus 3 and v of x is e to the power of x 

402
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,750
first we determine the 

403
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,430
two corresponding derivatives again that 

404
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,410
is u dash and v dash V' is 

405
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,790
quite fast, We 

406
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,910
saw earlier in the table that e raised to 
the power of x 

407
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,630
results in e raised to the power of x, 

408
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,830
which means that V' is also e 

409
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,330
raised to the power of x and the 
derivative of 1 half x 

410
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,490
raised to the power of 3 minus 5x plus 3 
is then 3 

411
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,830
half x squared minus 5. This means that we 
have 

412
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,170
already 

413
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,750
determined all the elements we need and 

414
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,610
we can now use them again. So we 

415
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,450
simply calculate u' times v plus u times 

416
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,710
v'. This means 3 half x² minus 5 times 

417
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,710
e to the power of x plus 1 half x to the 
power of 3 minus 

418
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,550
5x plus 3 brackets to times e to the power 
of x. 

419
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,750
And as I said, with e 

420
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,510
-functions you should 

421
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,290
always factor out the e-term and put 
everything in brackets 

422
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,190
. This 

423
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,590
is quite simple here , because we 

424
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,610
multiply both times only by e 

425
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,010
to the power of x. This means that we can 

426
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,890
simply add 

427
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,030
the plus to the brackets . We then have 3 
half x² 

428
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,570
minus 5 plus 1 half x³ minus 5x plus 

429
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,690
3 brackets multiplied by e to the power of 
x. 

430
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,710
Of course, this is now simplified. 

431
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,890
In other words, the minus 5 plus the 3 
gives us 

432
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,990
the minus 2 that we 

433
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,730
see below. And so we arrive at 1 half 

434
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,070
x³ plus 3 half x² minus 5x minus 2. 

435
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,270
and the whole thing times e to the power 
of x. And that 

436
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,590
's the first 

437
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,670
derivative, which you 

438
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,890

439
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,270
could of course derive a second time using 
the product rule. 

440
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,980
Finally, we come to the 

441
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,700
quotient rule. The quotient rule 

442
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,760
is always used when 

443
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,460
the initial function is a 

444
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,820
function that 

445
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,480
has the variable in the numerator , i.e. 
at the top and also in the denominator. 

446
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,300
This is also known as a fractional 

447
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,100
rational function. These 

448
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,000
almost always have to 

449
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,700
be derived using the quotient rule . In 
other words, whenever 

450
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,740
they 

451
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,770
contain the variable in the numerator and 
in the denominator . The important thing 

452
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,230
here is that with the quotient rule 

453
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,550
, it is important how u and v are chosen. 

454
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,450
In our case, 

455
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,550
u of x is the numerator polynomial 

456
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,450
and v of x is the denominator polynomial. 

457
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,250
We must not 

458
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,250
swap this in the following. So we are 

459
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,830
really talking about numerator and 

460
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,850
denominator functions. 

461
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,510
This naming alone 

462
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,930
actually makes it clear that it doesn't 
matter 

463
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,090
how you choose them. And 

464
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,090
now let's get started. 

465
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,170
Here we see the quotient rule, i.e. the 

466
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,450
solution to it. f' of x is equal to u' 

467
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,370
of x times v of x minus u of x times 

468
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,870
v' of x. And the whole thing divided by 

469
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,410
v of x squared. And now 

470
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,790
we see that it doesn't matter how we 

471
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,290
choose it. Because u of x is 

472
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,830
always the numerator function and v 

473
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,450
of x the denominator function. 

474
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,850
You can also remember this with a mnemonic 
like this 

475
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,270
. So numerator derived times 

476
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,290
denominator minus numerator times 
denominator 

477
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,050
derived and everything 

478
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,390
squared by the denominator . It is 
important to remember that because 

479
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,030
there is a minus here, you 

480
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,230
cannot swap it. This is a big 

481
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,510
difference to the product rule. 

482
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,150
You also have to be careful , as I said. 

483
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,890
In principle, it is exactly the same as 
the 

484
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,310
product rule, but we have a 

485
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,490
minus and therefore you can no 

486
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,370
longer swap it, which 

487
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,450

488
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,700
would be perfectly possible with the 
product rule. We will 

489
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,860
now demonstrate the whole thing again here 
using an example. 

490
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
This means that we still have the 

491
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,660
functional equation f of x equal to 2x 

492
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,860
by x² minus 4. Our u of x is 

493
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,580
then 2x, our v of x is equal to x² 

494
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,860
minus 4. 

495
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,400
And first we form 

496
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,140
our two derivatives again , i.e. u. u' 

497
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,780
and v'. 2x derived is 2 and x² 

498
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,980
minus 4 derived is 2x. 

499
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,800
As I said , x² becomes 2x and the minus 4 

500
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,580
is dropped. We have now 

501
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,760

502
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,340
determined all the elements we need. So u, 
v, u' and 

503
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,600
v' and 

504
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,680
insert them into this approach. So f' of x 
is equal to u' of 

505
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,300
x times v of x minus u of x times v' 

506
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,520
of x, the whole thing divided by v of 

507
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,440
x squared. So we start, u' 

508
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,760
of x 2 times, now comes our v of 

509
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,520
x, so x² minus 4 minus u of x times 

510
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,680
v' of x, so 2x times 2x. x we have 

511
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,360
that and the whole thing, you can 

512
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,260
also remember that , the denominator is 
simply 

513
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,720
squared, so x² minus 4, the 

514
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,760
whole thing squared. That's 

515
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,740
basically our first 

516
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,120
derivative again. Of course, we 

517
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,900
now want to simplify it , i.e. 

518
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,620
we'll try to summarize it. 

519
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,660
First of all, let's break up the brackets 

520
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,940
, 2x, 2 times x² is 2x² and 2 times 

521
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,560
minus 4 is minus 8. Minus 2x times 2x 

522
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,780
is 

523
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,340
minus 4x² and so we get 2x² 

524
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,780
minus 8 minus 4x². In the denominator, 

525
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,460
you could of course solve this binomial 
using 

526
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,380
the binomial formula, 

527
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,560
but you shouldn't do that , you 

528
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,580
should rather continue working with it. In 
the 

529
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,700
numerator, of course, we can 

530
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,460
still see that we have 2x² minus 4x², 
which 

531
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,980
can be reduced to minus 2x². 

532
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,060
And this is ultimately a 

533
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,720
solution that you 

534
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,230
can state with a clear conscience . Here 
we have 

535
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,070
another example. Again, 

536
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,450
4x²-0,2x±3x±1. You can see that we have 

537
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,570
our 

538
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,030
variable, in this case x, in both the 
numerator and the denominator . This means 

539
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,330
that we definitely need the 

540
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,010
quotient rule. First, 

541
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,990
we determine the numerator and 

542
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,610
denominator function again. The numerator 
function u 

543
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,230
of x is 4x²-0.2x±3 and the 

544
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,130
denominator function is simply x±1. In the 

545
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,730
next step, we determine 

546
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,630
the two derivatives again , i.e. v' and 

547
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,810
u'. u derived from x 4x²-0.2x±3 is 

548
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:15,530
2 times 4x-0.2. 2 times 4x is 8x. This 

549
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,850
can then be nicely summarized to 

550
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,630
8x-0.2. The derivative of x plus 1 

551
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,730
is simply 1, if you 

552
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,510
imagine that there is still a 1 in front 
of the x 

553
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,890

554
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,170
, as said at the beginning of the webinar 
, the x 

555
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,690
is then simply omitted when deriving and 

556
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,230
the 1 simply remains. And 

557
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,410
we now simply put this information 

558
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,770
back into our approach. We 

559
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,310
arrive at this. Parenthesis on 8x minus 0 

560
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,610
,2 parenthesis closed times parenthesis on 
x plus 

561
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,010
1 parenthesis closed. So this is now u' 

562
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:57,030
times v of x. Now minus u of 

563
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:03,190
x times v' of x. So 4x² minus 0.2x 

564
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,950
plus 3 times 1. The whole divided 

565
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,010
by the denominator squared, so x 

566
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,950
plus 1. The whole squared. 

567
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,930
In theory, this is already 

568
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,410
our first derivative. 

569
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,550
However, we still want to 

570
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,810
simplify it , i.e. 

571
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,750
remove the brackets . Therefore, in the 
first step, 

572
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,330
we multiply the two left 

573
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,450
brackets 8x minus 0.2 times x plus 1. 

574
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,690
This means we calculate 8x times x, which 

575
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,770
is the 8x², 8x times 1 is the 8x 

576
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:40,290
and then minus 0.2 times x is the 

577
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,470
minus 0.2x and minus 0.2 times 1 is 

578
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,230
the minus 0.2. We can see that the right 

579
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,390
bracket is simply 

580
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,550
multiplied by 1 , which means that this is 

581
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,850
not very important for us now. 

582
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,470
The only important thing now is that when 
we 

583
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,170
dissolve the right-hand bracket, we have 

584
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,090
a minus sign in front of the bracket, so 
we 

585
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,410
have to change all the signs. 

586
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,170
This means that we end up with minus 4x² 
and 

587
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,030
minus minus 0.2x, which is plus 0.2x 

588
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:15,450
and minus plus 3, i.e. minus 3. Whenever 

589
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,270

590
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,070
you have a negative sign in front of a 
bracket, you have to 

591
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,870
pay attention to the signs. 

592
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,930
But that's already the worst of the 

593
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,230
work done. 

594
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,650
All we have to do now is summarize. 8x² 

595
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,550
minus 4x² is 4x² plus 8x. We have 

596
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,030
minus 0.2x plus 0.2x. That 

597
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,950
balances out. In other words, the 

598
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,750
8x practically remain. Then 

599
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,990
we still have minus 0.2, minus 3, which 

600
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,810
together is minus 3.2. And importantly, 

601
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,530
please do not 

602
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,230
solve the denominator using the binomial 
formula. That brings us to 

603
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,330
the end of the 

604
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,270
webinar. Thank you very 

605
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,730
much for your attention.
