00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,850
Hello and welcome to our 

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,010
webinar on calculating with 

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,650
decimals. But before we really 

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,990
get started, is the sound loud, clear and 

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,470
distinct and can you see the picture 

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,250
? If so, please let me 

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,970
know very briefly in the chat with 

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,770
an OK or something like that and then 

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:18,390
we'll get started right away. 

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,150
All right, thank you. Yes, today we're 
talking 

11
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,830
about decimal numbers and 

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,410
we're also using the term 

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,290
decimal fractions. We'll 

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,590
see exactly why we're doing this in a 
moment. 

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,730
Namely, when we first 

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,270
answer the question , what are decimal 
fractions 

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,290
and then we look at how we 

18
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,530
compare these decimal fractions with each 
other 

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,850
or convert them into their 

20
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,390
two forms of representation. Then how 

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,830
we add, subtract, 

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,350
multiply and divide them. So 

23
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,210
we go 

24
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,630
through the four basic arithmetic 
operations again. We 

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,790
now also refer to them as 

26
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,210
decimal fractions 

27
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,910
, but as we will see in a moment, 

28
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,970
this is less about fractions and more 

29
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,090
about the fact that we 

30
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,990

31
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,230
can represent these decimal numbers in two 
different ways . 

32
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,650
So, first of all, what are 

33
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,910
decimal fractions? 

34
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,850
We can 

35
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,970
represent these numbers in decimal 
notation. 

36
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,310
We 

37
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,890
often simply refer to them as decimal 
numbers. 

38
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,710
For example, we have 0.5, 3.12, 0 

39
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,970
, 111111. So we always have a 

40
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,430
comma to the left of the decimal point. 

41
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,830
These are all the numbers that we 

42
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,670
already knew before. The things 

43
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,870
we can count on our fingers 

44
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,230
and so on. And then we 

45
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,530
got these decimal places. 

46
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,950
That's one way of 

47
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,730
representing decimal numbers using 

48
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,430
decimal point notation. The other is in 
the 

49
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,370
form of fractions. And what we are 

50
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,850
looking at today is 

51
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,110
not all possible fractions, but 

52
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,010
we are looking at fractions in particular 

53
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,870
by 

54
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,330

55
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,250
finding a power of ten in the denominator, 
i.e. in the lower number. The power of ten 

56
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,050
simply means that we always 

57
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,530
have a one and then zeros. So 

58
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,990
a ten, a hundred, a 

59
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,090
thousand, a ten thousand, always a 

60
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,210
one with a certain number of 

61
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,950
zeros behind it. Of course, there are 

62
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,330
still fractions where this 

63
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,150
is not the case. Generally speaking, we 

64
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,330
just talk about 

65
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,850
fractions. But when we talk about 

66
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,810
decimal fractions 

67
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,730
, we always mean those where 

68
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,870
such a number appears in the denominator. 

69
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,990
The reason behind this is that we 

70
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,890

71
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,310

72
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,910

73
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,390

74
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,810
can then do this conversion, the 
representation between these two types and 
ways, or the conversion between these two 
representations, very easily. 

75
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,930
we will see that the four 

76
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,190
have in common if 

77
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,470
we now 

78
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,550
want to compare decimal fractions then we 
must now 

79
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,890
generally look at okay how do 

80
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,970
we do it in one notation we 

81
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,050
do it in the other notation 

82
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,750
and by compare we always mean 

83
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,550
that we ask which of the two 

84
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,510
numbers is larger or smaller or 

85
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,890
are they perhaps both the same 

86
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,890
in the comma notation we go 

87
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,890
from left to right 

88
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,510

89
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,810
through the individual digits of the 
numbers with each other we 

90
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,250
simply compare them from which moment 

91
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,370
they are different and if they 

92
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,710
are different which is then 

93
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,330
larger or which is smaller 

94
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,550
so we take these two numbers 

95
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,250
here the 0,5 334 and the 0.5 38 and we 

96
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,530
want to compare this 

97
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,090
box in the middle, which is 

98
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,830
just a placeholder 

99
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,150
and we would like to 

100
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,110
write a sign for one is smaller 

101
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,870
than the other or it is larger than 

102
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,670
the other or maybe they are 

103
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,230
the same. To do this, we have to 

104
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,570
compare them. Yes, and we now go 

105
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,730

106
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,090
through the individual digits step by step 
from left to right. 

107
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,090
We actually start with the 

108
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,190
0 in front of the decimal point. Yes, 

109
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,170
of course we also compare them and 

110
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,890
find that they 

111
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,370
are the same. Okay, let's move on. Then we 
have 

112
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,930
the decimal point. Then comes the first 

113
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,470
number after the decimal point, the first 

114
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,970
digit, the 5. 

115
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,510
We also have a 5 for the right-hand number 
. 5 and 5 are 

116
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,590
of course the same digit. So 

117
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,490
we compare with the next 

118
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,550
digit. The 3 and the next digit 

119
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,430
here is also a 3. They are also 

120
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,950
the same. So we 

121
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,070
continue with the next digit. Now 

122
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,590
we take this 3. And now we have 

123
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,790
a different digit in the 

124
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,990
same place on the right , namely no longer 

125
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,850
the 3, but the 8. Yes, and 

126
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,030
we can then compare the two. 

127
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,010
We can say directly that the 3 is 

128
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,050
smaller than the 8. We always look 

129
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,690
from left to right. The left-hand number 

130
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,170
is smaller than the right-hand number. As 
a 

131
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,630
reminder, the sign for smaller 

132
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,730
is this, let's call it 

133
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,910
an arrow 

134
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,950
pointing to the left. As a mnemonic, you 
can 

135
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,850
remember that the tip of this 

136
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,650
arrow always points towards the smaller 
number 

137
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,730
. That's why 3 is 

138
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,490
smaller than 8. Yes, and because this is 
true, 

139
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,650
it also means that 

140
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,150
the left-hand 

141
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,090
number is smaller than the right-hand 
number. Because 

142
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,770
we have 

143
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,650
compared digit by digit, step by step, 
until we 

144
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,130
have identified a difference in 

145
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,710
a digit. And this difference, 

146
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,930
if one 

147
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,550
is larger and the other smaller, is then 
transferred 

148
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,640
to the whole number. Yes, that 

149
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,100
also means that it no 

150
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,360
longer matters what comes after it. We 

151
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,640
can see that there is another digit here, 

152
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,840
there is another 4 for example, 

153
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
the numbers could 

154
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,920
be much longer altogether . The moment 

155
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,880
we find a digit that 

156
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,480
is different, we can 

157
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,280
stop the whole thing and say, okay, if 

158
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,460
one digit is smaller than the 

159
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,920
other, then that also applies to the 

160
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,960
numbers as a whole. 

161
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,970
When writing fractions 

162
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,510
, basically the same applies as with 
fractions 

163
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,630
in general. So that we 

164
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,570
can compare the fractions , we have to 

165
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,890
bring them to the same denominator in 
order to 

166
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,770
compare the numerators. So 

167
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,210
we have to expand, possibly 

168
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,590
shorten, but in most cases 

169
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,010
we expand in order to bring the fractions 

170
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,310
to the same denominator. So now we're 
dealing 

171
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,150
with these 

172
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,270
powers of ten in the denominator, which 

173
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,350

174
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,350
makes the whole thing a little bit easier. 
Because here we want to 

175
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,170
compare the two fractions 3 

176
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,330
tenths and 33 hundredths. And we 

177
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,830
don't have to search long for 

178
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,050
a lowest common denominator 

179
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,710
, which is normally 

180
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,830
done by 

181
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,850
writing down both sets of numbers or 

182
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,530
doing other calculations. 

183
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,690
It's a bit 

184
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,990
easier with powers of ten . We have to 
consider that 

185
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,690
we have a 10 on the left and 

186
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,110
a 100 on the right, 

187
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,410
which means we want to 

188
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,730
add a 0 to the denominator on the left. 
Then 

189
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,770
we have a 100 in the 

190
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,510
denominator of both. And that 

191
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,110
ultimately means that I have to 

192
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,470
add 10 to the left-hand fraction. So, 

193
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,150
multiply the numerator by 10 and the 
denominator 

194
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,190
by 10. Because, let's stay with the 

195
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,410
denominator, 10 times 10 is 100. We have 

196
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,330
added a 0. And in the numerator, 3 

197
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,310
times 10 is 30. We've also just 

198
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,990
added a 0. And 

199
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,070
in the end, that's also what 

200
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,870
happens. We just keep adding 

201
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,230
zeros to the numerator and denominator 

202
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,670
until both denominators are equal. 

203
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,990
So you don't have to think about it 

204
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,370
with the I have to 

205
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,390
take times 10 , but you can 

206
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,150
think about it directly , I 

207
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,590
add zeros to the numerator and denominator 
until 

208
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,610
both fractions 

209
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,230
have the same number of zeros in the 
denominator. So now we have 

210
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,630
established that the left-hand fraction, 3 

211
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,890
tenths, is exactly the same as 30 

212
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,010
hundredths and we can now 

213
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,210
compare them. 30 hundredths and 33 

214
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,210
hundredths. 

215
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,110
All we have to do is look at the counters. 
30 

216
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,070
is smaller than 33, so 

217
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,710
the left-hand number or the left-hand 
fraction must also 

218
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,990
be smaller than the right-hand fraction. 

219
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,950
Yes, because 3 tenths and 30 hundredths 

220
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,770
are the same. 30 is smaller than 

221
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,490
33 and therefore 

222
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,310
the left fraction is also smaller than the 

223
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,830
right fraction . 

224
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,430
So generally everything you 

225
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,950
know about fractions also applies to 

226
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,930
decimal fractions, except that it is often 
a 

227
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,470
little bit easier because 

228
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,810
the denominators 

229
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,330
are always these numbers with 10, 100, 
1000, 10,000 and so 

230
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,550
on. 

231
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Now we come to the conversion. 

232
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,760
How do we get from decimal 

233
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,120
 notation to fraction notation 

234
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,980
and then vice versa? Let's 

235
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,060
take a look at an example 

236
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,400
with the number 0.283 

237
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,650
. And the first step we 

238
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,630
take is to 

239
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,470

240
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,930

241
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,890

242
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,470
count the number of 

243
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,150
digits after the decimal point or the 
number of digits after the decimal point, 
i.e. to the right of the decimal point. 
Two, the eight and the three 

244
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,910
are a total of three digits after the 
decimal 

245
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,050
point. This will be 

246
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,330
important again later. 

247
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,610
We want to 

248
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,790
put together a fraction that 

249
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,550
has the same value as 0.283 and 

250
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,970
we already know that the denominator 

251
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,110
of this fraction will contain this 

252
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,990
power of ten. A 10, a 

253
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,530
100, a 1000 and so on. We 

254
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,690
have to find out what the 

255
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,730
power of ten is and for this 

256
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,690
we have 

257
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,170
counted these three digits . Because we 
write exactly as 

258
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,630
many zeros after the 1 as we 

259
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,170
have counted digits. In 

260
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,190
our case, this means that the decimal 
fraction 

261
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,250
that we form has a 

262
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,210
number in the denominator that starts with 
a 1 and 

263
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,390
then has three zeros. So we need 

264
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,110
a 1000 in the denominator. 

265
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,730

266
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,110

267
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,730
The digits 

268
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,910
we have counted here are simply the digits 
on the fraction , i.e. in the numerator . 
We've just 

269
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,230
counted, but we're 

270
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,190
not writing in the 3, we're 

271
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,450
actually writing in these digits. 

272
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,270
So the 2, the 8 and the 3, which would 
then 

273
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,650

274
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,590
simply be 283 when expressed as a number. 
And 

275
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,570
we have already determined the denominator 

276
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,130
, which means we can now 

277
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,070
actually summarize it in 

278
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,170
one step. 

279
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,670
By counting the digits , we have 
determined that 

280
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,550
we need 1000 in the denominator 

281
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,250
. 1000 has three zeros and our number 

282
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,650
has three decimal places. And in the 

283
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,790
numerator, we then simply write 

284
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,530
this number as if it had no 

285
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,830
decimal point and of course we can 

286
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,890
save the zero at the front. And 

287
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,850
we simply get the 283 

288
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,750
thousandth. Because that's also 

289
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,530
what this number is here. We have 

290
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,950
the first decimal place, that's 

291
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,990
the tenths. The next is the 

292
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,870
hundredths and then it's the 

293
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,350
thousandths. In other words, if we look at 
it 

294
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,630
from this thousandths place 

295
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,710
, it's 283 

296
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,410
thousandths. This is also 

297
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,450
something that is 

298
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,070
measured in sports, for example, in the 
stopwatch time, where 

299
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,130
it is measured in hundredths or 

300
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,010
thousandths of a second. And 

301
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,270
this is also displayed in such a way 

302
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,210
that you say we have 10 seconds 

303
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,930
and 283 thousandths of a second. This 

304
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,450
can also be indicated with a 

305
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,550
decimal number or with a 

306
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,570
fraction. Ultimately, both mean 

307
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,150
the same thing. 

308
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,390
Now let's look at the reverse 

309
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,970
order. And then we'll 

310
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,850
go straight to a fraction 

311
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,670
that doesn't correspond to the idea 

312
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,530
of a decimal fraction that we 

313
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,130
learned earlier. We see that we 

314
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,090
don't have a power of 

315
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,270
10 in the denominator here , but that's 
not a problem, we'll 

316
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,390
just raise it to a 

317
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,810
power of 10, we would do that 

318
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,870
anyway and then we can 

319
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,330
quickly convert it. 

320
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,590
Let's take an extra 

321
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,150
step now so that we can include the 

322
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,030
more general case 

323
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,390
, but we'll see straight away that 

324
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,690
the whole thing is 

325
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,750
the same again from the second step 
onwards anyway. 

326
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,530
The idea is to expand the fraction 

327
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,150
or shorten it, depending on what 

328
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,710
is appropriate in the situation, so that 

329
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,690
the denominator is a 10, a 100, 

330
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,690
a 1000 or something more appropriate 

331
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,310
. In our case, we have 

332
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,230
25 in the denominator. You have to 

333
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,810
think about how you can 

334
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,390

335
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,930
get from 25 to the next possible power of 
ten . Yes, then you go 

336
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,970
through the 25 series and find 

337
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,970
the 100 relatively quickly. 100, because 
25 

338
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,610
times 4 is 100. 

339
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,010
So that means we can 

340
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,150
add 4 to this fraction . In the numerator, 
we calculate 6 

341
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,310
times 4, which is 24. In the denominator 

342
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,290
, we calculate 25 times 4, which is 100. 
That 

343
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,390
's the number we wanted. 

344
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,830
And now we have the 

345
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,270
decimal fraction. So, 

346
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,490
of course , if we 

347
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,830
start directly with the decimal fraction , 
then we don't have to 

348
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,970
do that. But now you can also see that you 
can 

349
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,970
do it with a different 

350
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,650
fraction by taking it to 

351
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,910
a power of ten. 

352
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,220
What we do now is 

353
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,180
write down the number in the numerator 
first, 

354
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,680
i.e. individually. We take it 

355
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,320
out first. The numerator is the number 24, 

356
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,360
but we know that we 

357
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,760
still have to put a decimal point there. 
The 

358
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,710
only question is , where do we put the 
decimal point? And 

359
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,030
let's imagine that 

360
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,910
not only is there 24, but there' 

361
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,550
s also a 

362
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,410
comma behind it , so to speak. Let 

363
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,790
's pretend that we 

364
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,830
take this 24 out and if the 24 

365
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,510
had a comma , then it would be behind it. 

366
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,990
Then it would basically be 24.0 

367
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,690
. 

368
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,690
But now we have to move this decimal 
point. 

369
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,390
We move it to the left by as 

370
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,150
many places as we 

371
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,630
have zeros here in the denominator. We 
have 

372
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,970
two zeros of 100 in the denominator 

373
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,290
, which means that we 

374
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,270
now have to move this decimal point, which 
is behind the number, 

375
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,630
to the left twice. If we 

376
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,890
move it to the left once, 

377
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,530
it is between the 2 and the 4, 

378
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,210
which would be 2.4. And if we 

379
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,050
move it again , then we 

380
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,970
actually have decimal point 2.4. But we 
can 

381
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,010
't leave a decimal point like this on its 
own 

382
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,290
, so we would 

383
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,430
of course 

384
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,150
add the 0 in front of it. So if we 

385
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,470
move the decimal point two places to 

386
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,290
the left from 24 , it will be in front of 

387
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,930
2 and 4 and then we 

388
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,470
add the 0. And then 

389
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,800
we have the 0.24. 

390
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,460
I didn't want to 

391
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,920
remove it that quickly. Leave it for a 
moment. 

392
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,700
So the idea is then that we can 

393
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,580
try to 

394
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,240
convert it to a power of 10 or 100, if 

395
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,300
possible. But the actual 

396
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,160
interesting steps that 

397
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,600
happen then are, we 

398
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,940
write down the numerator and 

399
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,300
then move the decimal point, which always 

400
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,460
starts after it, as many places 

401
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,860
to the left as we 

402
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,620
have zeros in the denominator . Of course, 
there are 

403
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,000
some fractions that are not 

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,460
so easy to reduce to a power of ten 

405
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,240
. Of course, there is always 

406
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,520
the other strategy, which we 

407
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,400
then 

408
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,620

409
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,280
bring up again in our webinar on fractions 
in general , where you then 

410
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,880

411
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,400
carry out the classic written division , 
where you simply 

412
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,120
go and say, I'll divide the 6 

413
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,760
by the 25 and do the 

414
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
written division. Today, 

415
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,680
however, it's mainly about decimal 
fractions 

416
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,820
and you would 

417
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,940
usually start here, with the 24 

418
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,760
hundredths, as you've seen, 

419
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,280
you can 

420
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,300
solve that quite simply with a decimal 
point shift. 

421
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,490
So, let's continue with 

422
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,950
addition and subtraction. 

423
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,200
Subtractions. What we already know 

424
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,300
is how to 

425
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,120

426
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920
carry out general written addition or 
written subtraction. 

427
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,560
Here on the right is a quick 

428
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,740
example. You write the numbers 

429
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,880
on top of each other, then go from place 
to 

430
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,040
place, from right to left and 

431
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,020
add or subtract 

432
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,840
the numbers accordingly. It 

433
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,300
sometimes happens that you 

434
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,080
have to take one in mind , but in general 

435
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,900

436
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,880

437
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,280
we know the calculation, the written 
addition, the written subtraction . Now 

438
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,600
the question is, of course , how do you do 
it with 

439
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,240
decimal fractions? Basically, you do 

440
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,780
it the same way. You just have to make 
sure that you 

441
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,900

442
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,260
write the numbers correctly one below the 
other and 

443
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,200
the decimal point is 

444
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,940
crucial. You 

445
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,860
always write the numbers underneath each 
other so that the 

446
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,380
comma 

447
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,180
is also underneath each other. This is 
because the 

448
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,500
ones are then under ones, tens under 

449
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,300
tens, tenths under tenths, 

450
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,560
hundredths under hundredths and 

451
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,280
so on. So the same 

452
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,920
principle applies, except that 

453
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,060
if we 

454
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,660
write it down like a table, we have an 
extra column 

455
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,540
for the decimal point. Here we have the 

456
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,580
number 0.48 and we have the number 12 

457
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,860
.099. And if we 

458
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,480
want to  add or subtract  them , then 

459
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,500
we have to 

460
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,560
write them one below the other so that the 
decimal point 

461
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,040
is underneath and all the other 

462
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,960
numbers automatically 

463
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,760
match in terms of their position. Yes, 

464
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
you just have to 

465
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,360
write it down thoroughly. And in general, 

466
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,780
of course, if 

467
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,360
one place is left blank, 

468
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
you can also write a 0 there 

469
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,920
or add a 0 and then 

470
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,120

471
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,180
calculate from right to left as usual. 
Yes, we think 0 

472
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,460
plus the 9 is then the 9, then 

473
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,200
we 

474
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,440
continue with the next digit. The 8 plus 
the 9 is actually 

475
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,260
the 17, so we 

476
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,200
add a 7 , 1 in mind. A 

477
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,560
1 in lower case should of course 

478
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,360
be written here. Here plus 

479
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,780
this 1 in the sense is the 5 and so 

480
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,380
on. Now you write the whole thing 

481
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,940
to the left. And the comma 

482
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,420
is then simply a sign, which you 

483
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,540
then place in the same 

484
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,840
position. This means 

485
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,880
that written addition and 

486
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,080
written subtraction 

487
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
also work with 

488
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,820
decimal fractions. You just have to 

489
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,020
write it properly so that the 

490
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,000
decimal point is underneath each other. 

491
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,760
That really is the most important thing 

492
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:28,940
. 

493
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,450
We 

494
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,590
already know the written 

495
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,750
version of multiplication , written 

496
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,530
multiplication, where we 

497
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,890
always 

498
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,010
multiply digit by digit . And then we do 
it once 

499
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,070
with one digit, once 

500
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,270
with the other digit and 

501
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,170
then we have to 

502
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,070

503
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,340
add all our intermediate results together. 
And here, too, you can 

504
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,900
think about 

505
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,120
transferring this to decimal fractions, to 

506
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,180
our decimal notation. But 

507
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,600
here, too , it is important 

508
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,460
that we count the number of 

509
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,200
decimal places and then 

510
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,840
use them again at the end. So there is 

511
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,340
a slightly different principle here. 

512
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,660
Let's take a direct look 

513
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,400
at the example. Then 

514
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,540
we'll go through the sentences again. 

515
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,780
I prefer to show it 

516
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,280
directly using the example first. We have 

517
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,500
the numbers 0.23 and 2.5 here and we 

518
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,680
would like to use them. 

519
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,460

520
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,980

521
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,920
We'll do the actual multiplication in the 
form of written multiplication right now 

522
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,760
, without the decimal point. 

523
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,740
But before we do that, let's count how 
many 

524
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,040
decimal places we have in total. 

525
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,300
We have two decimal places in the 
left-hand number 

526
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,700
and 

527
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,480
one in the right-hand number. 

528
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,760
This adds up to three. We need this 

529
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,960
at the very end when we 

530
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,140
determine our final result. We 

531
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,100
have a total of three decimal places. Then 

532
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,420
we 

533
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,600
multiply the numbers without the decimal 
point . This means we leave 

534
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,700
out the decimal point at 0.23. Then we can 

535
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,840
also leave out the 0 and we have 

536
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,980
the number 23. The 2.5, we leave 

537
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,260
out the decimal point and basically have 
the 

538
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,100
number 25. So basically, these are 

539
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,320
completely different numbers, 

540
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,800
because the decimal point is of course 
removed. 

541
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,700
But we multiply them together, 

542
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,540
23 times 25, with the written 

543
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,680
multiplication or maybe 

544
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,720
that results in numbers that you 

545
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,180
can even multiply together in your head. 

546
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,180
The important thing is to carry out the 

547
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,140
multiplication calculation without the 
decimal point. 

548
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,700
And the result of this multiplication 

549
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,220
is 575 

550
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,200
, but now we know that we have to 

551
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,400
add the decimal point again. 

552
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,660
The result of 0.23 times 2.5 is not 
actually the 

553
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,180
number 575, but we counted three 

554
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,440
decimal places earlier, so 

555
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,920
our result must 

556
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,800
now also have three decimal places. 

557
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,140
So we imagine again that the 

558
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,260
decimal point is actually behind it 

559
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,960
and we now have to move it 

560
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,100
three places to the left. 

561
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,380
And if we move it three places to 

562
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,120
the left, then it will be 

563
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,160
in front of the 5, i.e. in front of all 
the 

564
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,660
decimal places that we 

565
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,240
have just calculated. Before the 5, 7, 5, 
which 

566
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,640
is exactly three places. 

567
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,500
Of course, if the decimal point is on 

568
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,540
the far left at the front, then 

569
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,840
there must be another 0 in front of it. 

570
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
The number cannot 

571
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,300
start with a comma , but must 

572
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,740
be preceded by a 0. So the 

573
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,420
result is 0.575. After we 

574
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,040

575
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,120
have basically taken the numbers without 
the decimal point and then 

576
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,180
added the decimal point at the end. 

577
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,990
Finally, we look at the 

578
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,230
division. And with the division, 

579
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,990
we... we also play 

580
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,030
around a bit with the decimal point again 
, 

581
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,950
we move it again. 

582
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,910
If we 

583
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,350

584
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,470
want to divide two decimal numbers by each 
other , 

585
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,910
we first have to 

586
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,290
move the decimal point in both numbers so 

587
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,410
that either at least the right-hand 

588
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,230
number no longer has a decimal point, i.e. 
the 

589
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,710
number we are dividing by no 

590
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,270
longer has a decimal point, or we can take 
it 

591
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,770
further and move the decimal point 

592
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,390
until both numbers no 

593
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,510
longer have a decimal point. The latter is 

594
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,630
sometimes a little easier, 

595
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,070
which is why we are showing it here. 

596
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,150
So, let's start with our 

597
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,250
division that we 

598
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,390
want to do , 1.983 by 0.2. This is 

599
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,450
something that we 

600
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,550
can 't really calculate for now , or 

601
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,050
at least something that 

602
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,990
would be very, very complicated to 
calculate. So 

603
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,290
let's start by moving the decimal point 

604
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,210
. In this case, 

605
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,230
we want to move it to the right 

606
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,390
, because we want 

607
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,430
the decimal point to disappear at some 
point 

608
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,570
so that we no longer 

609
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,690
need it. So we move 

610
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,390

611
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,310
the decimal point in both numbers, not 
just in one, but in both numbers. 

612
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,930
Because as long as we move it in both 
numbers 

613
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,850
, the division 

614
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,590
always gives the same result. This is 

615
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,830
an interesting property of 

616
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,010
division. If we move the decimal point 

617
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,210
in both numbers, 

618
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,990
the division is always the same. 

619
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,470
So if we move it one place to 

620
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,650
the right, we have 19 

621
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,110
.83 and the 0.2 then becomes just 

622
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,810
2. The decimal point has now been 

623
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,190
moved to the right behind it, so 

624
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,890
we 

625
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,090
basically only have the number 2. You 
could even 

626
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,650
divide that now. You could 

627
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,810
start now and 

628
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,010
carry out the written division with this 
and then 

629
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,110
you would simply place the decimal point 

630
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,510
in the result in the same 

631
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,430
place if you 

632
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,830

633
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,630
were to skip this in the written division 
here, so to speak. 

634
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,550
But we're going to take this a little 
further, 

635
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,330
because sometimes it's a little 

636
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,690
easier to really 

637
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,090
simplify it a little more 

638
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,390
so that you don't 

639
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,390
have to keep an eye on the decimal point 
so much 

640
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,770
at first. But that's also a 

641
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,550
bit of a matter of taste. 

642
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,510
Personally, I used to 

643
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,490
learn how to 

644
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,950
divide it, but you can take it even 

645
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,250
further. We move the decimal point 

646
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,610
one place to the right. 

647
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,210
This now becomes 198 

648
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,090
,3 here on the left . And if I move the 2 
even 

649
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,290
further to the right, 

650
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,650
I now have to add zeros. 

651
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,550
So I make it 20. Then 

652
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,830
I have to do this one last time 

653
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,790
to 

654
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,050
make 1983 here on the left. And I 

655
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,590
add a zero to my 20 and that gives me 

656
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,690
200. But 

657
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,310
this division still gives the 

658
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,850
same result that we 

659
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,510
have already given here. Here we have 

660
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,170
already calculated 9.915 

661
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,410
. But that would have been the 

662
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,270

663
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,570
result of the other calculations with a 
little less shifting. 

664
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,850
But let's show again how this 

665
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:27,990

666
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,410
would look in the written division. 

667
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,470
We would consider, okay, 

668
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:37,990
how many times does the 200 fit into the 
1983? 

669
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,150
The 9 fits in there , because 9 times 200 

670
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,250
is 1800. Then 9 times 2 is 18. So 

671
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,610
written division, we ask 

672
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,510
again how often it fits in there and 

673
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,850
we first write the factor into the 

674
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:54,010
result. So now we 

675
00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,530
subtract the 1800. This leaves us with 
183. And 

676
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,830
in written division, 

677
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,210
we continue by 

678
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,410

679
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,010
subtracting the next number from the top, 
so to speak . Now 

680
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,110
we've actually already reached the end of 
the 

681
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,530
number, so it's very 

682
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,790
important, as we now 

683
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,410
have to add a 0 , so to speak, 

684
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,690
we have to 

685
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,190
put the decimal point in the result. This 
is what is shown here 

686
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,350
in red. 

687
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,170
As soon as the number is smaller than the 

688
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,750
divisor, as soon as this doesn't 

689
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,750
go any further, we have to add a 0 

690
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,590
so that we 

691
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,090
can continue dividing and 

692
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,690
put the decimal point in the result. 

693
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,060
So we continue with 

694
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,380
how many times does the 200 fit into the 
1830 

695
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,620
. That fits again 9 times, because 

696
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,560
the 1800 fits again. Only that the 9 

697
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,860
is now already behind the decimal point, 
because 

698
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,720
we are already in the part 

699
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,280
of this calculation where we 

700
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,340

701
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,300
have to keep adding zeros from above so 
that we 

702
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,280
can continue calculating at all. 

703
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,270
If we now 

704
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,430
subtract this from each other, 

705
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,130
the 30 would actually remain here , but 

706
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,710
we add a 0 again 

707
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,030
so that we 

708
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,510
can continue dividing . How often does the 
200 fit into the 

709
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,150
300? Exactly once, because once 200 

710
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,510
is 200. We subtract that again 

711
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,250
to get 100, to which we 

712
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,130
add another 0 to make it 

713
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,730
1000. And now the 

714
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,410
whole thing works out, because how often 
does 

715
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,810
the 200 fit into the 1000? Exactly 5 
times. 5 

716
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,500
times 200 is 1000 and we are 

717
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,960
finished at some point when we 

718
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,420
have no remainder left, when 

719
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,500
a zero is created. And then 

720
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,880
we have calculated the decimal number. 

721
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,820
Ultimately, this is also the way in 

722
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,780
which we 

723
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,320

724
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,720
could convert a fraction into a decimal 
number. If we 

725
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,980
were to imagine that we have the fraction 
1983.200, 

726
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
i.e. as a fraction, then we could... 

727
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,340
we could also 

728
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,180
carry out this conversion into a decimal 
number in the same way. Here, 

729
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,260
however, we have 

730
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,300
learned this in a different context. If we 

731
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,500
want to divide two decimal numbers, then 

732
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,840
I move the decimal point so 

733
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,400
that at least the right-hand number no 

734
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,140
longer has a decimal point or I push it 

735
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,360
a little further until both 

736
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,600
numbers no longer have a decimal point. 

737
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,840
Incidentally, if we 

738
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,000
did this here, the calculation would 

739
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,460
look exactly the same , except that we 
would 

740
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,760

741
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
still have this decimal point everywhere , 
in the 

742
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,880
appropriate place. So that 

743
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,120
doesn't make much difference in terms of 
the 

744
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,360
figures. The considerations, the 

745
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,380
calculations you have to make are 

746
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,220
all the same. The only important thing is 
that 

747
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
we place 

748
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,880
the decimal point at some point, as soon 
as we 

749
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,760
start to 

750
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,480
add zeros, so to speak, so that 

751
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960

752
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,800
we can continue dividing. 

753
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,020
However, it is very important that we 

754
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,120
never divide by a decimal number, 

755
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,140
so we would never divide by 0.2, we 

756
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,100
would always 

757
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,040
carry out this shift beforehand . 

758
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,580
We have just 

759
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,460
shown this using the decimal notation, 
because 

760
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,240
as soon as we 

761
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,000
write the decimal fractions as fractions, 
of course, with 

762
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
10, 100 or 1000 or so on 

763
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,980
in the denominator, then the 

764
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,200
normal fraction calculation rules for 

765
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,720
addition, subtraction, multiplication 

766
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,760
and division apply. So 

767
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,220
it works in exactly the same way as with 

768
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,700
normal fractions in quotation marks 

769
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,720
or, it would be better to say, 

770
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,660
more general fractions. 

771
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,240
Exactly the same rules apply. 

772
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,540
We also have a separate webinar on this 

773
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,200
if you would like to attend it. But 

774
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,340
then we'll just refer you 

775
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,500
to the general fraction calculation. What 

776
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,520
we mainly 

777
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,500
wanted to look at today were the basic 
arithmetic 

778
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,560
operations in the form of decimal 
notation. 

779
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:41,190
And that's the end of 

780
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,710
today's webinar on 

781
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,590
decimal fractions. First of all, thank you 

782
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,330
for your attention. If there are any 

783
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,430
questions or if 

784
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,130
you would like me to show you another 
slide, please let me 

785
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,390
know in the chat. What I 

786
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,170
can always recommend is to grab the 

787
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,350
exercises that we now 

788
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,110

789
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,930
have on this topic in the online learning 
center and simply practice the whole thing 

790
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,230
again. And if you do run 

791
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,130
into problems again, if the 

792
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,170
solution isn't right or if you have any 
more 

793
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,550
questions, then of course we 

794
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,970
also have more tutorial videos on the 
topic 

795
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:05,850
and our wiki. 

796
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,480
All right, that's great, 

797
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,620
I'm glad. 

798
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,080
Have a nice day and see you next time. 

799
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,520
Bye.
