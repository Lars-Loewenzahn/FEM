00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,380
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,660
Vectors, basics and terms. 

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,320
In this webinar, we 

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,900
will look at the basics of vector calculus 
and 

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,040
vectors. This means that we will 

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,480
first look at what 

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,200
a vector is , what its 

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,020
properties are and how you can 

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,540
calculate with them. In other words, we 
will 

10
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,640
look at addition, 

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,680
subtraction, scalar 

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,720
multiplication and the magnitude or 

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,920
length of a vector. and 

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,740
finally, we will look at the scale product 

15
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,480
in relation to the angles 

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,520
. the important thing here is that we will 

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,200
not just calculate this once, 

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,720
we will also go and 

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,460

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,900

21
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,360
illustrate it geometrically and 
graphically , respectively, but we will 
also illustrate the meaning . last but not 
least, 

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,660
we will look at the place 

23
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,860
vectors and the connecting vectors 

24
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,420
, i.e. the difference between the two and 

25
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,440
how to calculate both 

26
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,240
or what 

27
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,420
characterizes the two things. First of all 

28
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,340
, what is a vector? 

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,160
In school mathematics, it is usually just 

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,560
a jumble of teeth, you usually have 

31
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,740
two or three numbers 

32
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,880
arranged on top of each other. A 

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,440
vector is always marked with a small 

34
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,540
letter and an 

35
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,560
arrow above it. 

36
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,320
So whenever you have something like this, 
you 

37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,520
have a letter here and then 

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,780
an arrow above it, then that's 

39
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,900
a vector. And vectors are 

40
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,960
always 

41
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,000
written one below the other. In analytical 

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,900
geometry, i.e. in 

43
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,980
vector calculus, which you do at school 

44
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,300
, a vector can 

45
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,560

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,960
indicate a direction, a displacement or a 
location. This means that whenever 

47
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,260
you are in three-dimensional 

48
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,100
space, you have one of these 

49
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,480
three cases. So you either 

50
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,640
specify a direction, a displacement 

51
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
or a location. Vectors can 

52
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
of course also be used in linear 

53
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
algebra. There 

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,340
they can indicate a stock or a 

55
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,200
distribution or can also 

56
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,180

57
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,760
represent a solution to a system of 
equations . Some graphing 

58
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,340
calculators do this, for example. 

59
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,060
In this webinar, however, we will 

60
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,340
mainly 

61
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,120
refer to these three cases , i.e. actually 
only to 

62
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,100
analytical geometry, because this is where 

63
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,740
you will 

64
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,840
encounter vectors most frequently. Let's 

65
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,880
start with the properties. 

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,440
Every vector has a length and a 

67
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,300
direction. In fact, we 

68
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
always see two vectors here and we 

69
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,420
have now 

70
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,600

71
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,540
highlighted the differences between the 
two vectors . If we look at these 

72
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,360
two vectors 

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,900
, that is our x1, x2, x3, our three 

74
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,500
directions or degrees of freedom that 

75
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,520
we have. And we can see here that this 

76
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,060
is always the factor 2 of each other. 

77
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,760
It's always the same factor for all of 
them 

78
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,200
, sometimes 2, sometimes 2, sometimes 2. 
And if 

79
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,280
it's the case that the entries are 

80
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,740
only ever 

81
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,660

82
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,160
multiplied by a certain factor when the 
vector is multiplied by a certain factor, 
then 

83
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,980
only the length of the vector is 

84
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,320
changed. You do not change its 

85
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,180
direction. If you multiply the whole 

86
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,120
vector by times 2, 

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,580
the vector still points in the same 

88
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,720
direction, it just has a different 

89
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,800
length. The situation is different if you 

90
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,760
have vectors where the entries 

91
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,380
are not multiples of each other. 

92
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,120
This is the case here. Here we have 3 
times 

93
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,080
0 times something. You can 

94
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,460
't get from 0 to 1 by multiplication. This 
means that 

95
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,400
in no case are all 

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,720
entries multiples of each other. 

97
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Consequently, they have a completely 

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,160
different direction. So the 

99
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,420
direction of the vectors is completely 

100
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,400
different. 

101
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,660
They have nothing 

102
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,300
in common. A special case is 

103
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,540
when you 

104
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,560
have the so-called opposite vector , i.e. 
the numbers 

105
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,180
are reversed exactly ahead of time. Then 

106
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,480
it simply points in exactly the opposite 

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,440
direction. It is 

108
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,220
rotated by 180 degrees , which is 

109
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,460
usually not so bad, except for 

110
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,620
some factual problems 

111
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,780
. However, it is 

112
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,080
unattractive, so you should 

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,740
always be aware of the 

114
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,100
direction in which the vector is pointing. 

115
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,040
a mixture of these two 

116
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,360
is quite possible, i.e. if 

117
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440
you 

118
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,580
multiply by a negative factor, for 
example, 

119
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,620
the path has 

120
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,440
a different length on the one hand and 

121
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,300
a different orientation on the other 

122
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,660
, but that 's not a problem either - it's 

123
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,100
just a case that you often encounter with 

124
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,730
the positional relationship and that 
brings us 

125
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,590
to the right-hand 

126
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,270
arithmetic operation. Here we see 

127
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,890
the addition, the A vector 

128
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,610
plus the B vector results in a new 

129
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,590
C vector. Vectors are first 

130
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,830
added by performing the 

131
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,130
arithmetic operation within the 

132
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,410
individual components, 

133
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,750
i.e. 1 plus 2, 2 plus minus 1 and 4 

134
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,730
plus 3. This means 1 plus 2 is 3, 2 

135
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,390
plus minus 1 is 2 minus 1, i.e. 1, 4 

136
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,710
plus 3 is 7. In other words, this is the 

137
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,570
resulting arithmetic operation. 

138
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,750
Vector. You can visualize this graphically 

139
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,210
if we have A plus B. 

140
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,350
In other words, we have one vector 

141
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,310
that points this way and one that points 
that way. We 

142
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,190
first run through the A vector and then 

143
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,650
the B vector. Then 

144
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,890
we are back here and the C vector 

145
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,490
is then the vector that 

146
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,470

147
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,250
arises from this point, from the starting 
point to this point, i.e. against 

148
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,670
a 

149
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,880
displacement. 

150
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,260
Of course, the whole thing also works with 
subtraction. A 

151
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,180
 vector minus B vector equals C 

152
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,580
 vector. So 4, 2, 5, minus 1, 3, 

153
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,260
minus 2. Again, the 

154
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,380

155
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,620
calculation is only done within the 
components. 4, minus 1, 2, minus 3, 5, 

156
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,000
minus, minus 2. 

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,960
Always be careful with something like this 
, minus and minus, there is 

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,880
plus. Plus the 

159
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,860
seal 5, minus minus 2, 

160
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,660
because we already have it, is the same 

161
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,690
as 5 plus 2 and that is the 7. 

162
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,910
You can imagine it geometrically 

163
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,170
as follows. We have 

164
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,670
our A vector here and our B 

165
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,450
 vector here.  First we go 

166
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,770
along  our A vector. 

167
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,730
But now we don't go along our B vector in 
that 

168
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,950
direction, but we have 

169
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,750
minus B here. That means we take 

170
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,130
the opposite vector. 

171
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,710
as already mentioned, the opposite vector 
is simply the vector with 

172
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,710
the same length and the same direction 

173
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,610
, only rotated by 180 degrees, so 

174
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,630
we don't go away like this but like this 
and 

175
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,510
then we 

176
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,750
arrive at the point again and the 
resulting c vector 

177
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,230
is then the point that 

178
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,290

179
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,150
goes from the hour point of the two to 
this new point, so here again 

180
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,850
marked in green the 

181
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,700
scalar multiplication by a 

182
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,060
factor is actually only used to 

183
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,760
shorten or lengthen a 

184
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,700
vector. We see here that r times a vector 

185
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,440
equals b vector, for 

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,260
example 3 times 1 minus 2 3. This 

187
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,840
means that we multiply all components 

188
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,820
within the vector by the factor 

189
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,260
, in this case 3. 

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,900
So we calculate 3 times 1, 3 times minus 

191
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,460
2 and 3 times 3. 3 times 1 is 3, 3 

192
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,280
times minus 2 is minus 6 and 3 times 3 

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,880
is 9. As you can see, we have 

194
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,020
created a vector that is a multiple 

195
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,700
of the vector a, namely a 

196
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,480
multiple with the factor 3 and 

197
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,020
, as we 

198
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,140
learned at the beginning of the webinar , 
we have only 

199
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,600
changed the length. If we 

200
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,060

201
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,840
multiply by a negative factor, such as 
minus 1, for example 

202
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,500
, we calculate the so-called 

203
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,420
opposite vector. This is the vector that 

204
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,740
is 180 degrees in the opposite direction. 
And 

205
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,200
of course it can also 

206
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,540
have a different length. But the direction 
is 

207
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,940
the same . It is simply the 

208
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,240
orientation that has been changed. 

209
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,920
So you can also explain it 

210
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,200
by simply drawing the tip at the 

211
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,020
other end. 

212
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,600
Well, that brings us to 

213
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,180
the length. Every vector has a 

214
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,020
length. If you 

215
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,920
change the length of a vector, as we have 
just 

216
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,160
seen, we can now see 

217
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,500
how we 

218
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,680
can calculate the length of a vector . It 
is simply the 

219
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,920
square root of the individual components 

220
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
squared, i.e. 1 squared plus 

221
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,900
2 squared plus 2 squared, which 

222
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,220
in this case is the square root of 9, 

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,880
i.e. 3. This approach is based on the 

224
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
Pythagorean theorem for the 

225
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,180
spatial diagonal. And as I said, that 

226
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,840
would be the first step. Here we have 

227
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,880
the individual components. This 

228
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,960
is the resultant. The V is then 

229
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,980
the square root of V1 squared plus V2 

230
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,800
squared. Provided there 

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,100
is a right angle here. But these three 

232
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,760
directions are all perpendicular 

233
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,620
to each other. That is always the case. 
And 

234
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,880
therefore this 

235
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,900
Pythagorean approach can be used here. As 

236
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,600
I said, this is the formula that 

237
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,660

238
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,880

239
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
is always used to calculate the length of 
a vector or later the distance between two 
points if you 

240
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,100
insert the connecting vector here. 

241
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,880
We' 

242
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,840
ll see what a connection vector is in a 
moment. 

243
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,110
Now let's move on to the scalar product of 

244
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,850
two vectors. So we 

245
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,570
multiply two vectors 

246
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,950
together. So A vector times B 

247
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,850
 vector gives a value r. 

248
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,670
What's important here, and this is a very 

249
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,330
popular question, is that if the result of 

250
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,450
this scalar multiplication, i.e. the 

251
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,510
scalar product, is 0, both 

252
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,630
vectors are perpendicular to each other. 
This 

253
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,810
is always the case. So whenever the 

254
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,810
task is to show 

255
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,130
that the two vectors 

256
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,470
are perpendicular to each other, the 
solution is to 

257
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,890
form the scalar product and 

258
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,590
this must then be 0, then 

259
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,190
this is the proof that the two 

260
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,970
vectors 

261
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,490
are perpendicular to each other . 

262
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,990
We will show you how to form the scalar 
product here. So 

263
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,850
we have 2, 2, 4 times 1, minus 3, 1. 

264
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,310
We carry out the multiplication 

265
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,150
within the line, if you 

266
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,590
like. We could also 

267
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,150
divide it up like this , first line, 
second line, 

268
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,350
third line, if you like. 

269
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,270
However, we tend to speak of elements. 

270
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,110
In other words, we have 2 times 1 plus 2 

271
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,630
times minus 3 plus 4 times 1. So we 

272
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:02,230
multiply within the elements 

273
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,050
and then add the rows together. 

274
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,730
This gives us 2 times 1 plus 2 times 

275
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,450
minus 3 plus 4 times 1 and that is 0. 2 

276
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,510
times 1 is 2, 2 times minus 3 is minus 

277
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,450
6 and 4 times 1 is 4. This means we 

278
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,750
have 2 minus 6 plus 4. 2 plus 4 is 

279
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,910
also 6 and 6 minus 6 is then 0. This 

280
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,350
means that these two vectors are 

281
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,270
absolutely perpendicular to each other. 
Here we 

282
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,530
have a counterexample. 1, 0, 2 

283
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,130
times 3, 1, 4. 1 times 3 plus 0 times 1 

284
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,270
plus 2 times 4. 1 times 3 is 3. 0 times 1 

285
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,470
is 0. And 2 times 4 is 8. 

286
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,570
So we have 3 plus 8. That's 11. These 

287
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,970
two vectors 

288
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,270
are not perpendicular to each other, for 
example. 

289
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,070
Of course, you can not only 

290
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,930
distinguish between vectors 

291
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,110
that are perpendicular to each other and 
vectors 

292
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,330
that are not perpendicular to each other. 

293
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,310
You can also 

294
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,790

295
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,910
calculate the angle between these vectors 
. And this is 

296
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,850
the formula on the right. This formula is 
used 

297
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,930
to calculate the angle that 

298
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,210
exists between two vectors. Or 

299
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,510
that is enclosed by two vectors 

300
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,710
. This above, A times B vector, 

301
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,710
is simply the scalar product. 

302
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,850
These magnitude lines are the 

303
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,870
vector magnitude, i.e. the length. The 
important thing 

304
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,450
is that we multiply the 

305
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,550
vector length A by the vector length B. 

306
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,090
Yes, that's very important. And here 

307
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,510
above simply scalar product. We have 

308
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,310

309
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,890
done the whole thing for two vectors , so 
2, 0, 0 times 1, 2, 2, 

310
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,510
divided by the amount of 200 times 

311
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,370
the amount of 122 is equal to the 

312
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,870
cosine of alpha first 

313
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,190
we solve the scalar multiplication at the 
top 

314
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,890
2 times 1 plus 0 times 2 plus 0 times 2 

315
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,310
is 2 here at the bottom we have the root 

316
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,670
of 2 squared plus 0 squared 

317
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,750
plus 0 squared the root of 

318
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,170
2 squared is 2, then it 

319
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,690
continues here on the right, the root of 1 

320
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,570
squared plus 2 squared plus 2 squared 

321
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,830
, that's the root 

322
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,690
of 9 in total, so 1 squared 

323
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,430
plus 2 squared plus 2 squared 

324
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,590
is 9 and the root of 9 is 3, 

325
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,290
so we get 3 here and 

326
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,150
that' s how we get this nice fraction 

327
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,550
, that is 2 by 2 2 times 3 is the same 

328
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,110
as 2 sixths. You could also 

329
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,190
shorten it , but that's not so 

330
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,110
important. So we know that the 

331
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,030
cosine of alpha is equal to 2 

332
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,090
sixths. Of course, we don't want to 

333
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,270
know what the cosine of alpha 

334
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,410
is, but we want to know what 

335
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,830
alpha is. That's why we still need 

336
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,590
the inverse operation of the cosine. This 

337
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,910
is the cosine raised to the power of minus 
1, 

338
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,890
or sometimes the, 

339
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,910
or technically correct, the 

340
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,510
 argus-cosine. At school, 

341
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,910
however, we tend to talk about cosine 
raised to the power of minus 1. 

342
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,670
Well, we then know that alpha 

343
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,850
is equal to cosine raised to the power of 
minus 1 of 2 

344
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,290
sixths. And according to 

345
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,330
our calculator , that's about 70.5 

346
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,450
degrees. And that is the angle 

347
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,790
formed by the two vectors. And 

348
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,310
that brings us to the 

349
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,210
last point of our webinar, which 

350
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,950
is the position vector and the 

351
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,570
connection vector. A position vector 

352
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,870
always points from the origin of the 
coordinates 

353
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,030
to a point, i.e. we have 

354
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,670
some point and the vector 

355
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,410
points from the origin to this point. 

356
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,810
In principle, the 

357
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,370
coordinates are simply described as a 
vector. 

358
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:33,170
If you 

359
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,010
describe the points of a point as a 
vector, you 

360
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,350
automatically get the position vector. 
This is 

361
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,990
then labeled OP or 

362
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,630
simply P. It depends on 

363
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,910
what you want to do. 

364
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,890
Then there is the 

365
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,070
connection vector. As the name suggests 

366
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,470
, the connection vector 

367
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,930
connects two points. In other words, 

368
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,730
it indicates a displacement. And such a 

369
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,910
connecting vector is always 

370
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,370
used to set up straight lines 

371
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,790
and plane equations if you 

372
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,910

373
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,430
want to get from one point to another . 
For example, point 

374
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,950
A and point B in our case. So point A and 
point 

375
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,290
B are each 

376
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,990
indicated with a position vector , i.e. 
from the origin 

377
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,870
and therefore 

378
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,610
marked blue and orange here. And we now 
want to 

379
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,450
determine this green vector here, 

380
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,970
the connecting vector. We do this 

381
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,590
simply by 

382
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,390
calculating the target point minus the 
starting point, or also by 

383
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,570
calculating it as a point minus a foot. So 
in 

384
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,730
our example, B vector minus A 

385
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,110
 vector. The connecting vector 

386
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,170
AB is then our B vector minus 

387
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,850
our A vector. So Bx minus Ax, By 

388
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,270
minus Ay, Bz minus Az. So 4 minus 

389
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,690
2, minus 1, minus 3 and 3 minus 1. 4 

390
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,270
minus 2 is 2. Minus 1 minus 3 is 

391
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,050
minus 4 and 3 minus 1 is 2. And that 

392
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,250
is ultimately our 

393
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,570
connecting vector from the point. 

394
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,300
So minus 2, 4, minus 2, the 

395
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,980
vector would point from B to A. So the 

396
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,720
arrow would be the other way around. That 
would be 

397
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,620
the so-called opposite vector. 

398
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,820
That brings us to the end 

399
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,680
of the webinar. Thank you 

400
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
very much for your attention.
