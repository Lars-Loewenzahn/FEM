00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,460
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,560
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,580
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to give 
you 

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,620
an insight into the topic of 

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,820
homology and nomenclature. 

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,520
In 

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,220
chemistry , nomenclature refers to the 
systematic and 

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,700
internationally standardized 

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,440
naming of chemical substances. 

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,300

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,180
IUPAC, the International Union 

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,020
of Pure and Applied Chemistry, was 

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,660
founded over 100 years ago for this 
purpose. The 

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,340
global chemical nomenclature follows its 
rules. 

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,260
For this purpose, let us 

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,540
first look at the series of unbranched 

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,400
N-alkanes. Alkanes are the simplest 

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,920
hydrocarbons and have the 

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,120
general molecular formula CnH2n plus 2 

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,580

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,560
. The first and smallest 

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,960
alkane is methane with the molecular 
formula 

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,920
CH4 and the following structural formula, 

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,780
followed by ethane with C2H6, propane 

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,820
with C3H8 and butane with an 

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,780
additional CH2 group. Each 

27
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,500
further member of the series contains a 

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,440
further CH2 group. The names of the 

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,580
first ten alkanes have to be memorized 

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,280
, but this is 

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,620
made easier by the fact that from the 

32
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,640
fifth alkane onwards , the names are 

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
derived from the Greek counting words. 

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,240
Most people are probably familiar with the 

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,600
pentagon with its pentagons or the 
hexagonal 

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,720
structure of honeycombs, i.e. 

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,380
hexagonal . Hepta 

38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,200
stands for 7, octa is already 

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,780
known from the octet rule for 8, nona for 
9 

40
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,880
and deca is used for the decade of a 

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,760
decade, i.e. for 10. The 

42
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,400
rest of the naming follows the system 

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,340
of naming one digit followed 

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,080
by the 10th digit. So Undekan 

45
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,020
for 11, Dodekan for 12, Tridekan for 13, 

46
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,860
followed by Tetra- and Pentadekan. 

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,720
The 20 bears the name Eikosan 

48
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,580
, followed by Heneikosan and Dokosan. 

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,620

50
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,640
However, the system of further naming from 
Trikosan onwards remains the 

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,280
same. The C30 alkane is called 

52
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,040
tricontane, the C40 alkane tetracontane 

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,620
and the C50 alkane pentacontane. 

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,780

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,660
The 

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,700
homologous series of unbranched N 

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,780
-alkenes is analogous to the homologous 
series of alkanes and their nomenclature . 
Alkenes are 

58
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,060
hydrocarbons with a 

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,720
double bond and the general 

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,420
formula CnH2n. The smallest alkane with 

61
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,740
n equal to 2 is ethene, followed by 

62
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,540
propene and butene. The naming of 

63
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,120
alkenes differs from that of 

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,720
alkanes in the ending, in which an A 

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,600
is replaced by an E. The 1 before 

66
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,940
the ending indicates on which 

67
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,000
carbon atom, i.e. on which C 

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
 atom, the double bond is 

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,180
located and the Cs 

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,940
are named from the side on which the 

71
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,840
double bond is located so that the 

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,820
number is as small as possible. Although 
the 

73
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,580
Cs of propene 

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,780
could be named prop2ene or prop3ene 

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,340
, all three 

76
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,620
molecule names refer to the same molecule. 
The 

77
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,500
correct name applying the rules 

78
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,980
is prop1ene or simply propene. 

79
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,820
From butene onwards, the number before the 

80
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,460
ending becomes relevant for the structure, 

81
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,840
because here the 

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,380
double bond could also be 

83
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,580
located between the two middle Cs. But2ene 

84
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,080
would be a structural isomer of the 

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,840
but1ene shown here. Structural isomers 

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,020
have 

87
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,440
different structures despite an identical 
summation formula. In the case of alkenes 

88
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,860
, this means that the 

89
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,380
double bonds are in a different 

90
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,280
position. 

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
The homologous series of 

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,900
alkenes shown here always has the double 
bond 

93
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,060
at a terminal C. 

94
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,740
The hydrocarbons also include 

95
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,660
alkenes, which 

96
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,780
have a triple bond and the general 
molecular formula 

97
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:00,280
C2H2N-2. They have the ending 

98
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,180
and the number of the C to which the 

99
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,060
triple bond is attached, just like 

100
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,340
the alkenes. Otherwise 

101
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,080
, the naming system of the 

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,780
members of this homologous series remains 
unchanged. 

103
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,400
Apart from hydrocarbons 

104
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,300
, there are also other homologous series 

105
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,840
of organic compounds that 

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,460

107
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,160

108
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,060

109
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,180
are made up of other elements in addition 
to carbon and hydrogen . These include the 

110
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,420
oxygen-containing alcohols 

111
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,320
with the general molecular formula CnH2n 

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,120
plus 2O or CnH2n plus 1OH. 

113
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,480
Alcohols have the suffix "-ol", 

114
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,660
which 

115
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,420
stands for the hydroxyl group, i.e. the OH 
group. The simplest 

116
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,620
alcohol is methanol and is toxic to 

117
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,600
humans. The C2 alcohol ethanol 

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,340
is the 

119
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,900
common alcohol we are familiar with from 
everyday life and is 

120
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,500
contained in alcoholic beverages 

121
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,280
. It is followed by 

122
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,600
propanol, butanol and pentanol in the 
homologous series. Again 

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
, only those alcohols 

124
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,820
are shown which 

125
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820

126
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,340
have the hydroxyl group on a terminal C. 
Another group of 

127
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,760
organic compounds that 

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240

129
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,200
can be represented in a homologous series 
are the alkanoic acids 

130
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,140
or carboxylic acids with the general 

131
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,220
molecular formula CnH2n plus 1COOH. These 

132
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,220
consist of a carboxyl group, 

133
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,040
i.e. the COOH group, and an 

134
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,320
alkyl radical or, in the case of 

135
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,060
methanoic acid, only one hydrogen. 

136
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,540
In the general molecular formula of 

137
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,860
carboxylic acids, we can use the 

138
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,120
natural numbers from 0 for n. 

139
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,920
The simplest carboxylic acid is therefore 

140
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,980
methanoic acid with the formula HCOOH and 
the 

141
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,970
following structural formula. 

142
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,770
The next representatives of this 
homologous 

143
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,870
series are ethanoic acid, also 

144
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,230
known as acetic acid, 

145
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,190
propanoic acid and butanoic acid. In this 

146
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,770
homologous series, the 

147
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,350
functional group is again located at the 

148
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,350
terminal C, recognizable by the 

149
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,450
letter N in front of the molecule name. 

150
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,090
The N indicates that it is an 

151
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,890
unbranched alkyl radical. 

152
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,110
Branched alkyl radicals have the 

153
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,670
prefix ISO or the number of the C at which 
there 

154
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,390
is another alkyl group 

155
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,410
. Thank you for your 

156
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,190
attention. I hope this 

157
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,790
video has given you a better 

158
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,670
understanding of homologation 

159
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,150
and nomenclature. See you 

160
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,690
next time!
