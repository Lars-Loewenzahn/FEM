00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,350
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,430
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,910
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,090
something about the physical 

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,650
properties of metals. 

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,270
In our online learning center 

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,830
you will of course also 

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,730
find a wiki on this topic , in which 

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,210
the basic and important 

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,190
terms are explained in more detail. 

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,430
In contrast to chemical 

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,050
properties, which 

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,610

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,250
describe the behavior of metals in 
chemical reactions , 

15
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,090
physical properties describe the 

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,890
behavior of metals outside of 

17
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,370
chemical processes. But what are 

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,370
physical 

19
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,990
properties? Physical 

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,150
properties are divided into the 

21
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,910
sub-areas of physics. 

22
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,490
These are thermodynamics, mechanics, 

23
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,090
electrodynamics and optics. 

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,690
There are a large number 

25
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,090
of measured variables for each subject 
area. Here are a few 

26
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,050
examples of the four subject areas. 

27
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,090
In thermodynamics, you will find measured 
variables 

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,170
such as the state of matter, density, 

29
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,050
melting point, boiling point and 

30
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,570
thermal conductivity. 

31
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,390
In mechanics, the following measured 
variables are 

32
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,150
important. Strength, 

33
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,550
ductility, i.e. deformability 

34
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,090
and elasticity. In the field of 

35
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,750
electrodynamics 

36
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,810
, electrical conductivity, 

37
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,230
magnetic conductivity and 

38
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,490
magnetizability are very important to us. 

39
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,490
In the field of optics, we limit ourselves 

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,670
to color and reflection, also 

41
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,310
known as gloss. Here is some general 
information on 

42
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,990
physical properties. 

43
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,170
Firstly, the structure 

44
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,990
determines the properties, 

45
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,370
not only the physical 

46
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,970
properties, but also the 

47
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,710
chemical properties. Secondly, the 

48
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,270
physical properties are 

49
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,690
temperature-dependent. Table values 

50
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,030
usually refer to a 

51
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,730
specific temperature, for example 25 

52
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,210
degrees Celsius. Thirdly, many 

53
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,830
properties of metals can be 

54
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,970

55
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,030

56
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,530

57
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,650
traced back directly to the typical metal 
structure consisting of a metal ion 
lattice with freely moving electron gases. 
First, 

58
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,590
let's look at the thermodynamic 

59
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,590
properties. All metals are 

60
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,550
in a solid 

61
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,670
state at room temperature. There is only 

62
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,550
one exception and that 

63
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,070
is mercury . Now let's look 

64
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,190
at the density. This is 

65
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,790
called Rho in a formula and is 

66
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,750
calculated from the mass m and 

67
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,870
the volume V of the substance according to 
this 

68
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,190
formula. Rho is equal to m divided 

69
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,910
by V. As a rule of thumb, you can 

70
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,930
remember that increasing atomic numbers 

71
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,650
of elements also lead to increasing 

72
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,850
atomic masses and increasing 

73
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,010
atomic masses 

74
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,930
result in a higher density. 

75
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,530
You can easily determine differences in 
density if you 

76
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,290

77
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,230
hold objects of the same size in your 
hands, for example a 

78
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,310
plastic fork and a 

79
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,670
metal fork . The plastic fork 

80
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,530
has a much lower density than the 

81
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,450
metal fork . It is therefore much 

82
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,290
lighter, even though the two forks 

83
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,670
are the same size and therefore 

84
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,410
have the same volume. Then there are 

85
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,670
the melting and 

86
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,210
boiling temperatures of the metals. 

87
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,170
In most cases, these are much higher 

88
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,050
than for non-metals. The 

89
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,110
metal bond is a very strong 

90
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,170
bond, so a lot of energy in 

91
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,930
the form of heat is required to break the 

92
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,390
bond. However, this is 

93
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,290
a prerequisite for the transition 

94
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,090
to the liquid or gaseous 

95
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,470
state. 

96
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,070
However, there are differences between the 
various metals 

97
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,050
. 

98
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,290
It is therefore not possible to determine 
a generally valid rule. 

99
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,530
However, elements with a 

100
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,990
similar atomic structure, i.e. the same 

101
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,850
main or secondary group in the 

102
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,510
periodic table, also have similar melting 

103
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,030
 and boiling temperatures. For the 

104
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,870
thermal conductivity, I will 

105
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,010
first explain what heat actually is. 

106
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,290
In short, heat is the 

107
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,090
kinetic energy of the particles. The 

108
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,350
more the particles 

109
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,670
vibrate in the crystal lattice, the higher 

110
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,790
the temperature. So 

111
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,250
the particles in a crystal lattice vibrate 

112
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,350
more strongly the more the material is 

113
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,910
heated. The particles vibrate 

114
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,470
together as a whole. The 

115
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,130
kinetic energy is always 

116
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,570
transferred to the neighboring particles 

117
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,010
. In this way, the 

118
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,410
heat is 

119
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,130
transported through the crystal lattice . 
With regard to 

120
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,910
metals, we can 

121
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,150
deduce from the structure how the 

122
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,470
thermal conductivity behaves. This is 
where 

123
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,250
the typical structure of 

124
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,590
metals comes into play again. The freely 

125
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,210
moving electrons can 

126
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,210

127
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,350
transport the heat, i.e. the kinetic 
energy, quickly. 

128
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,170
The thermal conductivity of metals is 

129
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,250
therefore very good. In the field of 

130
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,190
mechanics , too, many properties 

131
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,610
of metals can be 

132
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,010
attributed to the metal bond. The forces 
of attraction 

133
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,590
between the metal ion lattice and the 

134
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,450
electron gas are very high. 

135
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,490
A large force is therefore required to 

136
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,810
break the metals. This is what is 

137
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,150
meant by the term mechanical 

138
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,570
strength. But let's start 

139
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,250
at the beginning. 

140
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,970
If a force is applied to a metal object, 

141
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,090
it first deforms elastically. 

142
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,410
You can think of it like 

143
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,290
a rubber band, except that the 

144
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,990
elongation of the metal is not 

145
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,750
as great as that of a rubber band. 

146
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,030
When the force disappears, the metal 

147
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,970

148
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,790
returns to its previous shape , just like 
the rubber band. How great the 

149
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,450
elongation 

150
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,310
is in relation to the force is 

151
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,530
described by the elasticity . It is 

152
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,450
different for every metal. In addition, 
the end of 

153
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,110
the elastic deformation is also 

154
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,870
different for each metal. At some point, 

155
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,390
the force becomes too great and the metal 

156
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,810
begins to deform. This time, 

157
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,930
however, in such a way that 

158
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,690
the deformation remains when the force is 
released. 

159
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,910
This property is called 

160
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,130
ductility and is also directly 

161
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,450
attributable to the metal bond. The 

162
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,970
electron gas ensures that 

163
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,690
different levels of the crystal 

164
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,790
can move without 

165
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,510
breaking apart. This makes the 

166
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,830
metals ductile, i.e. malleable. If 

167
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,270
the force on the metal is increased even 

168
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,190
further, at some point the 

169
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,710
final limit is reached and the metal 

170
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,330
breaks. This force is 

171
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,110
called strength. Like the other 

172
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,410
properties, 

173
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,270
electrical conductivity is also directly 

174
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,970

175
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,210
attributable to the electrical gas in the 
metal lattice . Electrical 

176
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,310
conductivity presupposes that freely 

177
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,250
movable charge carriers, i.e. 

178
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,330
charged particles, 

179
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,290
are present in metals. 

180
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,650
Silver, copper 

181
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,810
and gold have the best conductivity . Some 
metals 

182
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,190
also have magnetic properties. These 

183
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,090
metals are iron, cobalt and 

184
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,630
nickel. They have 

185
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,810
microscopically small magnetic areas in 
their structures 

186
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,830
, which 

187
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,110
are called Weiß's districts . Initially, 
they are 

188
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,030
disordered and their magnetic fields 

189
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,550
point in different directions 

190
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,070
so that they do not 

191
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,130
appear magnetic to the outside world. 

192
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,070
However, if you bring a magnet close to 
them, 

193
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,510
some of the 

194
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,150
magnetic fields align in the same 
direction 

195
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,570
. This allows the magnet to adhere to the 

196
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,710
metal. If the metal remains 

197
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,910
in the magnetic field for longer or if 

198
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,910
the magnetic field is strengthened, 

199
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,650
all the white areas in the 

200
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,250
magnetic field align in the same direction 

201
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,470
. The metal has then been 

202
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,250
magnetized. 

203
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,330
The 

204
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,930
electron gas also plays a decisive 

205
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,110
role in the optical properties. It 
reflects the light 

206
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,650
almost completely, which means 

207
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,370
that the light 

208
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,690
is mirrored on the surface. We perceive 
this as 

209
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,590
a metallic shine. The small 

210
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,510
amounts of light that 

211
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,030
are absorbed, i.e. swallowed, cause 

212
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,790
the different colors of the metals. 

213
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,590
I hope that you now know more about the 

214
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,930
physical properties of 

215
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,050
metals. If you still have questions about 

216
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,570
these or other topics, 

217
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,170
