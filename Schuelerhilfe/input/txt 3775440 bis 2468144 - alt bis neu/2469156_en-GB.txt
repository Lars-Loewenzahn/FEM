00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,510
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,570
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,430
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,210
the basics of orbitals in 

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,390
chemistry to you. In our online 

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,170
 learning center you will 

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,470
also find a wiki  on this topic 

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,670
, in which the 

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,350
basic and important terms 

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,410
are explained in more detail. Perhaps 

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,950
you 

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,410
have already heard the term orbit in other 
areas. It 

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,470
describes the elliptical 

14
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,130
orbit, for example of a 

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,730
satellite, around the earth. Earth. Both 

16
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,210
words come from the Latin 

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,650
word orbis, which 

18
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,790

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,050
can mean, among other things, circle, 
roundness or the round. In chemistry, 

20
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,230
orbitals also indicate where an electron 
is located in 

21
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,010
relation to the nucleus of an atom. 

22
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,810
In contrast to satellites, which 

23
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,970

24
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,790
have a fixed mathematical, clearly 
describable orbit 

25
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,110
, it should be noted that 

26
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,850
this 

27
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,790
cannot be clearly determined with our 
current means 

28
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,950
, which is why the orbital 

29
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,590
describes a space in which the electron 

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,450

31
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,210
is located with a probability of 90% . 
There are different types 

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,310
of orbitals. 

33
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,930
A distinction is usually made between S, P 
and D 

34
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,930
 orbitals. Above a certain 

35
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,830
number of electrons, F 

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,390
 orbitals, G orbitals, S orbitals and 

37
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,030
H orbitals can also occur. In the case of 
G and H orbitals 

38
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,070
, it should be noted that they 

39
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,710
usually only occur when the 

40
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,970
electrons are excited. 

41
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,830
However, we will 

42
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,150
not deal with these orbitals today. Let us 
now look at 

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,290
their appearance, their arrangement around 
the atomic nucleus and 

44
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,210
the number of electrons within the 

45
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,470
orbitals. S orbitals are spherical 

46
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,370
and can 

47
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,290
accommodate up to two electrons . As the 
same 

48
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,250
orbital shape appears several times, 

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,930
they are 

50
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,170

51
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,910
differentiated using numbers, the 
principal quantum numbers. For example, 
the 

52
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,770
1s and 2s orbitals are occupied first 
before 

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,610
p orbitals are formed. They resemble 

54
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,470
a dumbbell in appearance, with 

55
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,030
space for two electrons 

56
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,530
. From the second 

57
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,370
main quantum number, 

58
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,770
up to three p orbitals can form, which 

59
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,530

60
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,670
are aligned along the x, y and z axes in 
the model. From 20 

61
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,950
electrons, d orbitals can 

62
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,910
occur. There are five of them. 

63
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,410
Four look like a double dumbbell. 

64
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,490
The fifth d-orbital is a dumbbell 

65
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,130
with a center ring. Each d orbital 

66
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,930
can contain up to two electrons. 

67
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,030
Let's take a look at this using an 

68
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,650
example. Let's look at 

69
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,150
Bohr. Bohr has the atomic number 5, which 
means that 

70
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,850

71
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,810
there are 5 protons in the atomic nucleus 
and therefore it also has 

72
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,450
5 electrons. The atomic nucleus is 
surrounded by the 

73
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,250
first s orbital. It contains 

74
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,790
2 electrons. This means that the first s 

75
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,170
 orbital is already fully occupied. 

76
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,230
This is followed by the second s orbital 
with the 

77
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,390
principal 

78
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,670

79
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,870
quantum number 2. Finally comes the p 
orbital, which also has the principal 
quantum number 2. 

80
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,810
It contains the last electron. The 

81
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,910
whole thing can also be 

82
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,670
represented in writing. The first s 

83
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,010
 orbital contains two electrons 

84
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,270
, as does  the second. The 

85
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,490
p 

86
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,590
orbital assigned to the second principal 
quantum number contains one electron. This 

87
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,090
is one way of representing the 

88
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,970
electron configuration. Let's summarize 

89
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,290
this briefly. 1. 

90
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,930
orbitals indicate where an 

91
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,790
electron is located with a 90% 

92
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,250
probability. 2. there 

93
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,690
are 6 different orbitals distributed 

94
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,630
over different 

95
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,310
principal quantum numbers, with S, P and 

96
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,730
D orbitals being the most commonly used 

97
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,390
orbital forms. 3. each of these 

98
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,990
orbitals contains 

99
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,270
a maximum of 2 electrons. 4. 

100
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,430
if you 

101
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,070
write out all the occupied orbitals in the 
orbitals, you get the 

102
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,750
electron configuration. I hope 

103
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,030
that I have been able to help you 
understand the 

104
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,450
basics of orbitals 

105
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,590
. 

106
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,390
You can 

107

atoms in the second video on orbitals . In
