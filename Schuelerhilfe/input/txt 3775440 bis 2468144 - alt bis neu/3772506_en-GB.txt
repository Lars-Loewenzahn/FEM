00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,680
Combinatorial Counting Methods. 

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,620
In this webinar , we will 

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,240

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,020
look at various counting methods. We will 
first look 

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,440
at why we need the 

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,940
counting methods and which methods 

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,580
exist at all. We will then 

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,220
look at these, I'll 

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,320
say it in advance, three 

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,080
methods. These are 

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,400
permutation, combination and 

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,560
variation. We will 

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,220

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,260
present the three cases or a total of six 
cases using an example and 

16
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,500
at the very end we will 

17
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,120

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,480

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,880
summarize the formulas that we have shown 
or used again using a small collection of 
formulas. 

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,120
It is important here that we 

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,900
differentiate between combination and 

22
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,940
variation without 

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,400
repetition and with repetition, and 

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,660
with permutation 

25
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,000
we differentiate between 

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,440
can we differentiate the elements 

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,240
and cannot differentiate. 

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,400

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,720
Of course, I will explain again in which 
case we have each case and 

30
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,440
also why we have this case. 

31
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,080
But let's start first, why do 

32
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,300
we need counting methods and what 

33
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,020
are they anyway? 

34
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,300
Counting methods are methods for 

35
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,280

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,060

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,320
counting combinations, permutations and 
variations of sets in a distinguishable or 
indistinguishable way. 

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,460
In other words, we often need this 

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,540
in probability theory, 

40
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,420
because the general 

41
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,700
concept of probability is 

42
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,720
the number of favorable outcomes divided 
by 

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,280
the number of all possible outcomes. 

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,800
Using these three methods, i.e. 

45
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,220
combination, permutation and 

46
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,300
variation, we can 

47
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,920
determine the denominator of this 
fraction. This is because the 

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,460
numerator of the fraction is actually 

49
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,600
always determined quite quickly or 

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,100
perhaps 

51
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,000
already indirectly 

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,460
specified in the task. However, it is 

53
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,140
often difficult to 

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,360

55
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
determine the denominator, i.e. the number 
of all possible results . Cases 

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
can occur? How 

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,360
many combinations are there? And that's 
exactly 

58
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,280
what we'll be looking at in this 

59
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,860
webinar. In other words, we 

60
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,260
are less concerned with the 

61
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,320
calculation of probability and 

62
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,120
more with the number of all possible 

63
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,680
events, i.e. combinations. 

64
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,540
And that brings us to 

65
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,200
permutation, variation and 

66
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,600
combination. The permutation indicates 

67
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,520
how many possibilities there are to 

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,460
sort the elements of a set. 

69
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,960
An example of this is the 

70
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,540
allocation of seats at a table. 

71
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,220
We also have this as an example. And with 

72
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,300
permutation, we differentiate 

73
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,380
between distinguishable and 

74
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,320
indistinguishable. The variation gives 

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
all the many possibilities that there 

76
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,200
is an ordered and an 

77
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,740
unordered sub-distribution of a 

78
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,780
subset of L elements. 

79
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,260
In other words, we have an example. 

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,600
A number of athletes take part 

81
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,260
in a competition with gold, 

82
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,860
silver and bronze medals. The important 

83
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,400
thing is always whether you 

84
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,660

85
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,580
look at this with repetition or without 
repetition . And that also depends 

86
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,820
on examples. We have 

87
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,300
one example with repetition 

88
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,700
and one example without repetition. 

89
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,740
The same applies to the combination. 

90
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,140
We also have two examples for this, 

91
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,820
so that you can easily see what 

92
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,480
it depends on. I'll 

93
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,840
start by saying that this is actually 
always from 

94
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
the 

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,860
Unfortunately, you have to read the text 
accordingly and 

96
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,460
understand and interpret it. 

97
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,440
Finally, we have the 

98
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,720
combination. Combinations indicate 

99
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,360
how many possibilities there are to 

100
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,160

101
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,660
take k elements from an n-element set. 
This is simply the 

102
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,260
binomial coefficient. So 

103
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,820
combinations are actually 

104
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,200
what we 

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
need in stochastics for the binomial 
coefficient 

106
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
, or for the Benulli chain. 

107
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,860
An example of this would be 

108
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
How often do you hear it clarified when 

109
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,440
ten people post each other? And 

110
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,260
so I would say, let's start 

111
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,480
with the permutation. In this 

112
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,120
case, the permutation is of 

113
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,980
distinguishable quantities, because we 

114
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,400
have the example of 

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,260
five people sitting at a table. And the 

116
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,380
question now is, how many 

117
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,800
possible distributions are there? 

118
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,740

119
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,660
Of course, we can keep the five people 
apart. 

120
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,020
Let's assume that they all have a 

121
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,800
name, so we can 

122
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,380
easily tell them apart and 

123
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
calculate how many 

124
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,880
ways there are to distribute these five 

125
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,460
people at this beautiful table 

126
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,480
. The formula for this is 

127
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,040
simply the factorial of n, i.e. the 

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
n exclamation mark. The exclamation mark 

129
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,180
is the formula symbol for the 

130
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,780
factorial, which means that 

131
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,960
all numbers up to n 

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,540
should be multiplied together. This means 
that if 

133
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,860
the factorial of 5 is 

134
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,740
described here , that is 5 times 4 times 3 

135
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,840
times 2 times 1 or 1 times 2 times 3 times 
4 

136
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,600
times 5. In this case, that is 120. This 
means that 

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,940
there are 120 ways to distribute the 

138
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,880
seats. 

139
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,200
How do we come up with that? You can 

140
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
also imagine the whole thing. The 

141
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,640
first person takes a seat. They have 5 

142
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,220
seats to choose from, which they 

143
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,520
can use. When they have sat down, 

144
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,860
the next person has four more 

145
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,060
seats to choose from. Once they have sat 
down, 

146
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,520
the next person has 

147
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,560
three more seats to 

148
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,660
choose from and the next person only has 

149
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,180
two, until the last person only 

150
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,540
has one seat left and that's how 

151
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,560
it all adds up. If we do 

152
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,200
the math, 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 is 

153
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,080
already 120 and then 1. That's how we get 

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,120
to 120, or rather we have. 

155
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,340
.. nothing more than the 

156
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,180
faculty. And that brings us 

157
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,300
to permutation 

158
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,260
2. We are dealing with a 

159
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,080
group of indistinguishable elements. 

160
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,800
In other words, we now have the case 

161
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,040
that we have spheres, blue, red and 

162
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,900
green, but we can 

163
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,240
no longer 

164
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,840
distinguish the blue spheres from each 
other. That's the big 

165
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,040
difference compared to just now. 

166
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,720
We could tell all the people apart. 

167
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,860
In this case, we can't 

168
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,600
tell the balls apart. We have seven blue 

169
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
balls that we can 

170
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,160
't tell apart. Ten red ones that 

171
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,180
we 

172
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,880
can 't tell apart. And three green balls 
that we 

173
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,680

174
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,560
can 't tell apart. This means that the 
result of 

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,140
the distribution of these balls is 

176
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,640
then given according to the pattern blue, 

177
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,320
red, green, green, blue, red. This 

178
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,900
does not mean a red ball with the number 

179
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,640
1, because they have no numbers. 

180
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,180
There is only one red ball for us. 

181
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,500
As we have already 

182
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,440
said several times , we cannot distinguish 
between the red balls. 

183
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,900
And that's why we now have 

184
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,660
permutations with groups of 

185
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,180
indistinguishable elements. And that's 
what 

186
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,140
we calculate. We simply form the 

187
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,080
factorial of the number of all spheres and 

188
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,380
then divide this factorial by 

189
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,320
the product of the factorials of the 

190
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,920
subgroups. In other words, we have 

191
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,200
seven blue spheres here, i.e. 

192
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,920
20 factorials divided by the factorial of 

193
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,960
seven times ten red spheres, i.e. times 

194
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,040
the factorial of ten times the 

195
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,620
factorial of three for the three 

196
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,900
green spheres. And as 

197
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,420
I said, these are numbers that can only be 
calculated 

198
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,500
with a calculator, 

199
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,040
otherwise they would be too large, and 
that is the 

200
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,280
number of possible combinations 

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
that we can create in this way. 

202
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,680
As I said, the combinations 

203
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,880
only consist of blue, red and green and 

204
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,310
, as I said, that's the number and that 

205
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,410
's a lot. 

206
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,620
That brings us to 

207
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,820
combinations, in this case without 

208
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,520
repetition. Yes, I 

209
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,400
said at the beginning that we always have 
an 

210
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,340
example of combination and 

211
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,180
variation without repetition and 

212
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,900
with repetition. In this case, the 

213
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,780
example is without repetition. 

214
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,840
In other words, this corresponds to 
drawing without 

215
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,480
putting back, without observing the 

216
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,980
sequence. We have the 

217
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,160
task of 

218
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,840
selecting three people from a group of 15 

219
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,660
. How many 

220
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,360
grouping options are there? 

221
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,020
In this case, I'll explain again how this 

222
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,160
comes about. In this case, 

223
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,740
one person is selected 

224
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,520
and this person is then no longer 

225
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,860
available for selection. In other words, 
after the 

226
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,720
first person of the 15 

227
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,160
has been selected , there are only 14 left 
to 

228
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,840
choose from. After the second person has 
been 

229
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,400
selected, there are only 13 left 

230
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,340
to choose from. That's why it's without 

231
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,240
a reserve. And it's 

232
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,580
simply about putting together 

233
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,220
a group or a team, if 

234
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,520
you like. There's no 

235
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,680
hierarchy in there or nothing that 

236
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,940
should or 

237
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,800
can differentiate them. So it doesn't 
really matter 

238
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,040
in which order the people 

239
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,000
were chosen or drawn. 

240
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
They are in the group and that's all 

241
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,780
we can say about it. Therefore, 

242
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,040
the order doesn't matter. Therefore, 

243
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,680
draw without putting them back, regardless 

244
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,900
of the order. 

245
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,440
To answer the question, we need 

246
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,980
the so-called 

247
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,480
binomial coefficient. This is the one 

248
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,360
we always 

249
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,200
 need in the Bernoulli  chain. In other 

250
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,080
words, the formula is n over k, which is 
the 

251
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,820

252
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,060
prime coefficient . And this can be 

253
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,500
calculated by 

254
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,320
dividing the factorial of n by k factorial 
times n minus k and 

255
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
then the factorial. In this case n is 

256
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
the number of people we have, 

257
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,820
in this case 15, and the k is the 

258
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,980
number of people we choose, 

259
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,060
so how many do we choose, in this 

260
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,160
case three. So we get F 

261
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,260
-faculty of 15 by faculty of 3 

262
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,120
times 15 minus 3 and from that the 

263
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,240
faculty. That's 455 in total, which 

264
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,720
means there are 455 ways of 

265
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,960
putting the group together. And therefore, 

266
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,620
the task is already 

267
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,140
calculated. 

268
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,680
You 

269
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,260
don't always have to calculate a binomial 
coefficient like this. 

270
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,780
The calculator can also work it out. 

271
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,680
The command for this is usually 

272
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,660
this ncr. Yes, that should be 

273
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,180
somewhere in the menu or on the 

274
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,360
calculator and then 

275
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,780
it can also 

276
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,540
solve such binomial coefficients . 

277
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,490
And that brings us to 

278
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,430
combination with repetition. 

279
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,730
In this case, we have the task of 

280
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,470
18 

281
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,350
participants taking part in a decathlon . 

282
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,090
There can be exactly one winner in each 
event. How 

283
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,050
many possibilities are there for 

284
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,130
distributing the winners? 

285
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,570
Decathlon means that ten 

286
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,650
competitions are held and in 

287
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,030
our case 18 participants take part 

288
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,790
. It is important to note that there will 

289
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,910
not be one overall winner of 

290
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,630
the event, but 

291
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,950
there can be one winner for each of the 
ten fights 

292
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,310
. Conversely, this 

293
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,730
also means that one participant can 

294
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,250
have ten winners. And that's why there's a 
draw 

295
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,750
. In each fight, 

296
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,190
regardless of whether the previous fight 

297
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,890
was won or lost, 

298
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,910
all 18 participants still have the 

299
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,950
chance to win or not. 

300
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,730
That's why it's a draw with a 

301
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,650
reset, because 18 participants always 

302
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,430
have the chance to win. 

303
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,270
Furthermore, the order doesn't matter, 

304
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,350
because it's 

305
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,500
about the possibility... the 

306
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,800
distribution of the winners. It's not 

307
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,040
about who has won what and it's 

308
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,540
only about the possibilities 

309
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,080
of the winner distribution and there is 
only 

310
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,780
one victory and no victory. We 

311
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,980
don't differentiate between gold, 

312
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,420
bronze, silver, we'll do that 

313
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,200
again later and so it's without 

314
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,220
regard to the order. The 

315
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,580
formula we need for this is 

316
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,080
also a binomial coefficient. It's 

317
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,680
just heavily modified. 

318
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,300
Earlier we had N over K, now we have, 

319
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,500
as I said, in a 

320
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,260
binomial coefficient n plus k minus 1 

321
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,640
over k. 

322
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,180
But we calculate the binomial coefficient 

323
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,160
in the same way as before, either using 
the 

324
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,740
calculator or n plus k minus 1 

325
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,720
of which the factorial is divided by k 
factorial 

326
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,340
times n minus 1 factorial. And so 

327
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,220
this n minus 1 simply comes from the fact 

328
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,780
that we would actually have 

329
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,740
written here 

330
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,480
what we 

331
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,820
had written on the last slide and that can 

332
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,960
of course be simplified here 

333
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,080
because we also 

334
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,200
have n and k in here. That's why it is, 

335
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,680
let's say , simplified . We 

336
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,140
actually had n minus k in here 

337
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,240
and for us it would now be n 

338
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,280
plus k minus 1 minus k plus k plus k minus 
k 

339
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,920
is n minus 1. So just take 

340
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,520
the formula and then you have 

341
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,900
the result directly or you can 

342
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,000
use it directly. In our case, the n equals 

343
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,240
17 and the k equals 10, so we arrive 

344
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,180
at the factorial of 27 by the 

345
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,400
factorial of 10 times the factorial of 

346
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,940
17 and we have this 

347
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,240
number of different possibilities 

348
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,880
for the distribution of the winners. 

349
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,980
In this case, that's 8,436,285, so that 

350
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,550
's quite a few. And that's it 

351
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,910
for the combinations. 

352
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,450
And we are now looking at the 

353
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,770
variation. We now have 

354
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,710
the variation without repetition. 

355
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,230

356
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,910
Of course, I'll explain why this is the 
case in a moment. In our 

357
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,990
case, this now corresponds to drawing 

358
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,990
without putting back and observing the 

359
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,990
sequence. Our task is, 

360
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,870
or rather the factual context 

361
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,490
is, 15 athletes are taking part in a 

362
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,470
competition. There is one gold, 

363
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,730
one silver and one bronze 

364
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,290
 medal. How many possible 

365
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,350
outcomes are there? In this case, 

366
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,150
we are only looking at one 

367
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,830
competition and there is 

368
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,790
only one winner distribution. That's 

369
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,070
the big difference to the 

370
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,810
decathlon just now. And this time, 

371
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,170
there is not only victory or no 

372
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,370
victory, but also a distribution. 

373
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,870
There is a 

374
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,890
gold medal, a 

375
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,110
silver medal and a 

376
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,430
bronze medal. This 

377
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,750
means that there are three medals 

378
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,450
that are distributed and then 

379
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,590
of course the order is important, 

380
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,430
because it makes a 

381
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,670
difference whether I 

382
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,270
get the gold medal or the bronze medal. 

383
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,710
That's why the order is so 

384
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,650
important. It's pulling without 

385
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,130
putting it back, because if I 

386
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,190
win the gold medal, I can 

387
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,570
't 

388
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,670
get the silver or bronze medal . I can 
only 

389
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,470
win one medal at a time. 

390
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,200
To do this, we need this 

391
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,280
formula, namely the faculty of N 

392
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,560
by N-K faculty. As I said, N is 

393
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,400
the number of athletes who 

394
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,140
took part. K is the number 

395
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,700
of medals that are awarded. 

396
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,060
In this case, that is three. 

397
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,960
We now have the faculty 

398
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,140
of 15 through brackets to 15 minus 3 

399
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,800
faculty This is then the faculty 

400
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,240
of 12 And now the calculation 

401
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,080
with faculties comes 

402
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,540
into play a little The faculty of 15 is 15 

403
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,120
times 14 times 13 times 12 times 11 and so 

404
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,920
on The faculty of 12 is 12 times 

405
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,300
11 times 10 and so on That means 

406
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,600
we can shorten it out What remains 

407
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,640
is 15 times 14 

408
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,920
times 13. That means there are 2730 

409
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,620
possible results. 

410
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,100
Yes, so 2730 possible outcomes 

411
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,850
for this race. The idea 

412
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,150
behind this is, of course, that if 15 
people 

413
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,870
take part, there are 15 possibilities 

414
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,610
for gold. If the gold medal 

415
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,770
is awarded, there are only 14 

416
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,410
possibilities for silver and so 

417
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,390
on. Yes, so that's the one with no 

418
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,150
backing up and so it's 

419
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,890
definitely without backing up and 

420
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,990
because of the gold-silver-bronze 

421
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,950
 principle, the order is also 

422
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,650
important. This brings us to the 

423
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,870
last part of the variation with 

424
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,090
repetition. 

425
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,870
For example, we have a 

426
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,370
combination lock that has four 

427
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,790
digits and you can 

428
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,090
enter the numbers from 0 to 9. 

429
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,650
It is important to note that the numbers 
from 0 to 9 are 

430
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,990
a total of 10 possibilities and 

431
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,790
of course we have the case with repetition 
here 

432
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,470
, because if the first 

433
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,750
digit is a 1, we can 

434
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,770
continue to 

435
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:41,010
use 1 as the second digit and then always 

436
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,330
use the same digit. So 

437
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,790
it is not used up after it has 

438
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,110
been used once. This means 

439
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,790
that repetitions are possible. 

440
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,430

441
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,050
Of course , the order is important here. 
The end of the number 

442
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,710
always has a sequence, which is 

443
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,550
also important. This means that if 

444
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,930
I set the code 1234 

445
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,230
, it will not work with 4321 

446
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,430
, which is why the sequence is also 

447
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,690
important. And for the variation with 

448
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,990
consideration of the sequence 

449
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,930
, you simply calculate n to the power of 
k. In other words, the number 

450
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,250
of possible digits . For 

451
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,810
us , this is all digits from 0 to 0. 9, 
i.e. 10 and 

452
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,290
k is the number of digits, is 

453
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,430
4 for us, i.e. 10 to the power of 4. 

454
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,870
So there are 10,000 combinations. 

455
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,190
You can also visualize this 

456
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,850
quite well with the number finder . These 
are 

457
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,590
all combinations from 0, 0, 

458
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:40,410
0, 0 to 9,999 and so 

459
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,710
there are 10,000 

460
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,690
possible combinations. 

461
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,610
Finally, here is 

462
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,130
our small collection of formulas 

463
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,670
, as we said during the webinar. 

464
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,270
In permutation, we 

465
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,790
always distinguish between distinguishable 
and 

466
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,430
indistinguishable. If it is 
distinguishable 

467
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,110
, we have the 

468
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,930
factorial of n. If it is indistinguishable 

469
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,350
, we have 

470
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,510
the factorial of n by the individual 

471
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,870
factorials of the subgroups. When we 

472
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,430
deal with combinations, 

473
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,770
we distinguish between put back without 

474
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,750
put back and 

475
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,230
put back with put back. If we 

476
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,770
have without putting back, we simply take 

477
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,470
the binomial coefficient n over 

478
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,350
k. This can always be calculated 

479
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,090
by the factorial of n by k 

480
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,930
-factorial times n-k-factorial. If we 

481
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,930

482
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,830
look at it with put back and repeat , this 

483
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,170
binomial coefficient changes to this. 

484
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,970
This means that we have n plus k minus 1 

485
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,810
over k. This can 

486
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,150
then be resolved using the same approach 
and this 

487
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,410
then results in n plus k minus 1, of which 

488
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,470
the factorial, by k factorial times n 

489
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,990
minus 1 factorial. For the variation, 

490
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,630
we also differentiate between 

491
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,610
without restoring and with restoring. 

492
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,230
If we do not put back, we 

493
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,810
simply have factorial of n by n minus 

494
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,510
k factorial and if we 

495
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,350
look at the variation with putting back, 
we 

496
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,130
simply have n to the power of k. We just 

497
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,310
have it with the combination lock. That 
brings us to 

498
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,790
the end of the webinar. 

499
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,390
Thank you for your 

500
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,090
attention.
