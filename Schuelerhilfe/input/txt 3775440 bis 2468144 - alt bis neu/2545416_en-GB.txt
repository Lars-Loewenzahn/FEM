00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,090
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,210
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,150
at Schülerhilfe. Today I 

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,950
would like to explain something to you 
about nutrition and 

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,250
enzymes. 

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,270
There are countless 

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,750
different biochemical 

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,770
processes going on in our body at any 
given time . Most of these 

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,230
processes involve the 

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,070
conversion of one molecule into 

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,090
another. A prominent example 

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,790
of this is the stomach. 

13
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,090

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,190
Enzymes are a core component of these 
conversion processes. 

15
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,470
Enzymes are proteins and therefore 

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,170
organic macromolecules. Their name 

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,750
usually ends with the syllable "-ase", 

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,170
for example in transferase. Enzymes 

19
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,290
have a so-called active 

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,370
center to which the substrate, 

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,210
i.e. the substance to be converted, 

22
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,030
is bound. It is important to know 

23
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,610
that enzymes are very specific, i.e. 

24
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,970
substrate-specific. 

25
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,170
This means that they only bind a specific 

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,810
substrate to their active center. This 

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,270
works according to the 

28
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,250
 lock-and-key principle. Only certain 

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,790
substances fit into a certain 

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,610
protein and vice versa. The function 

31
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,630
of enzymes is diverse and 

32
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,630
depends on the process in which they 

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,010
are involved. As an example, 

34
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,390
let's take a 

35
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,330

36
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,590
closer look at the function of enzymes in 
the stomach, blood and saliva . 

37
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,230
The enzyme pepsin is mainly found in the 
stomach. The 

38
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,130
precursor pepsinogen 

39
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,250
is produced by the gastric mucosa. On 

40
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,410
contact with the low pH value of 

41
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,470
stomach acid, pepsinogen is converted into 

42
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,290
pepsin. This 

43
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,770
prevents pepsin 

44
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,570
from becoming active in the body and 

45
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,590
digesting its own cells in an uncontrolled 
manner. 

46
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,270
Pepsin breaks down proteins into 

47
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,510
amino acids. It requires 

48
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,630
chloride as a cofactor. This means 

49
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,670
that both substances, pepsin and chloride, 

50
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,350
must be present for the 

51
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,030
reaction to take place. 

52
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,090
Next, let's take a look at enzymes in the 
blood. 

53
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,070
Enzymes can be 

54
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,490

55
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,730
present in the blood for two different 
reasons. Firstly, many 

56
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,750
enzymes are transported through the blood 

57
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,730
and secondly, some 

58
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,750
enzymes work in the blood. The 

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,790
enzymes active in the blood are involved 
in blood clotting and 

60
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,710
fat and cholesterol metabolism 

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,530
. On to the mouth. 

62
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,510

63
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,790
The body produces around 1 to 1.5 liters 
of saliva every day . Saliva 

64
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,610
contains the enzyme amylase. This 

65
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,410
breaks down polysaccharides into 

66
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,410
monosaccharide molecules, i.e. glucose. 

67
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,110
This means that the first step of 

68
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,550
digestion 

69
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,010
takes place in the mouth. We can see that 
enzymes 

70
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,470

71
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,090
can fulfill various functions. In addition 
to those already 

72
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,230
described, enzymes can 

73
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,970
act as biocatalysts, i.e. 

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,850
they accelerate a certain 

75
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,310
chemical reaction in the body by 

76
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,110

77
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,790

78
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,310
reducing the activation energy of a 
certain chemical process . The special 
thing about 

79
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,150
enzymes is that 

80
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,270

81
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,890
they emerge unchanged from the catalyzed 
reactions and 

82
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,810
are immediately ready for use again. 
Enzymes are 

83
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,270

84
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,010
named differently depending on their 
function. The 

85
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,230
main functional groups are 
oxido-reductases, 

86
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,750
transferases, hydrolases, lyases 

87
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,850
, isomerases and ligases. Now that we 

88
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,550

89
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,430
have taken a closer look at some of the 
functions of enzymes 

90
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,550
, the next step is to look at the 

91
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,230
different types of enzymes. 

92
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,890
We have already learned from pepsin 

93
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,070
that there are enzymes that only 

94
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,830

95
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,030
function in the presence of a cofactor . 
On the other hand, there are also 

96
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,670
enzymes that work without a cofactor 

97
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,450
. These enzymes 

98
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,290
are called protein enzymes. In addition to 
the 

99
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,310
presence of a coenzyme 

100
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,970
, there are other factors that 

101
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,670
influence enzyme activity. 

102
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,910
These include the temperature, the 

103
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,410
substrate concentration, i.e. how much 

104
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,490
of the substance to be converted 

105
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,590
is present, the pH value and the presence 

106
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,410
of toxins. The RGT 

107
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,950
 rule, i.e. the 

108
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,310
reaction 

109
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,710
rate-temperature rule, is also important. 

110
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,190
According to this rule, 

111
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,990
the reaction rate doubles to triples 

112
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,230
when the temperature is increased by 10 
degrees. 

113
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,850
Other factors influencing 

114
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,010
enzyme activity are competitive 

115
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,590
and allosteric inhibition. In 

116
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,410
allosteric inhibition, the 

117
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,170
inhibitor binds to the allosteric 

118
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,650
center of the enzyme. This reduces the 

119
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,550
efficiency of the enzyme. 

120
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,730
Incidentally, in addition to 

121
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,330
allosteric inhibition, there is also 

122
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,650
competitive inhibition. In this case, 

123
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,690

124
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,850
the active center is 

125
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,210
blocked by a substance that is chemically 
similar to the target substrate. This 
creates an 

126
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,550
enzyme inhibitor complex as opposed 

127
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,750
to an enzyme substrate complex. As a 
result, 

128
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,550
the enzyme changes its structure. 

129
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,010
More precisely, it is a 

130
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,750
change in the three-dimensional 

131
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,450
structure of the enzyme. As a result, 

132
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,370
the substrate no longer fits the active 

133
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,290
center of the enzyme and therefore 

134
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,770
cannot be converted. Depending on the 

135
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,710
quantity ratio, the conversion of the 

136
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,570
actual target substrate can 

137
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,430
be slowed down or even prevented. 

138
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,890
However, by increasing the 

139
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,610
substrate concentration, the 

140
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,390
competitive inhibition can be reversed 

141
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,070
, as the enzyme 

142
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,330
is more likely to encounter a substrate 
molecule than 

143
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,330
an inhibitor. 

144
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,790

145
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,850
In addition, bound inhibitors can 

146
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,230
be displaced from the active site, making 

147
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,690
competitive inhibition a 

148
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,110
reversible inhibition . Inhibition. 

149
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,530
The function of enzymes 

150
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,370

151
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,050
is vital for human survival and they 

152
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,390
perform many important tasks in the 

153
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,710
human organism . The problem, however, is 
that 

154
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,450
enzymes are only 

155
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,750
heat-resistant to a limited extent ; at 
temperatures above 40 degrees 

156
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,890
they break down and denature. This 

157
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,830
is also one of the reasons why we 

158
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,730
can die from a very high fever. 

159
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,290
I hope that you now know more about 

160
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,210
enzymes. However, if you 

161
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,310
