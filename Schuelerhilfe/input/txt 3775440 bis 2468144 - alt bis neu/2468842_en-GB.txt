00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,790
Hello, my name is Paula and I 

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,070
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,270
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,110
something to you about binary salts 

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,570
in chemistry. In our 

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,270
online learning center, you will 

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,870
of course also find a wiki on this topic 

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,390
, in which the 

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,890
basic and important terms 

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,830
are explained in more detail. Let's start 
with 

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,330
an illustrative 

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,710
example. If you 

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,590
mix two primary colors , for example red 
and blue, 

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,510
you get a so-called 

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,730
secondary color, in our case purple. 

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,630
Based on color theory, you can 

17
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,410

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,210
determine the secondary color in advance. 

19
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,070
Similar 

20
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,470
rules can be applied to the synthesis of 
binary salts . But what is 

21
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,550
binary salt anyway? Binary 

22
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,830
means that it consists of two 

23
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,230
components. And since it is 

24
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,650
a salt, these 

25
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,530
components must be 

26
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,270
present in their ionic form. To determine 
the two 

27
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,930
components , let's take a 

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,950
look at the main groups of the periodic 
table 

29
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,970
. All the elements listed here can 

30
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,150

31
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,730
be divided into three groups. The metals, 
the 

32
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,990
semi-metals and the non-metals. 

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,790
To form a salt, you need 

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,730
a component that donates electrons 

35
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,690
, the electron donor. These are 

36
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,710
semi-metals and non-metals, with 

37
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,750
the exception of noble gases. Due to their 

38
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,570
different reaction behavior 

39
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,170
, the semimetals are not 

40
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,290
discussed further here. And the 

41
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,950
noble gases are also 

42
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,910
excluded for salt formation. We have now 

43
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,190
determined our possible components. But 
how do 

44
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,890
the salts form? And what 

45
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,530
reactions take place in this process 

46
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,850
? Let's start with the metals. 

47
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,310
They give off a number of electrons 

48
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,610
that is identical to their 

49
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,130
main group. So lithium 

50
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,390
gives off one electron. Magnesium 2, 

51
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,130
aluminum 3 and so on. For 

52
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,910
non-metals, you can 

53
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,730

54
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,250
calculate the number of electrons they 
accept by 

55
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,650
subtracting the main group from 8. The 
only 

56
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,970
exception is hydrogen, which 

57
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,630
can only accept one more electron. 

58
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,850
Now we come to the actual 

59
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,330
salt formation. To do this, we choose a 

60
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,010
metal and a non-metal. 

61
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,610
First sodium and chlorine. Sodium 

62
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,690
releases an electron and chlorine 

63
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,730
accepts an electron. 

64
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,790
The result is sodium chloride, i.e. 

65
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,390
ordinary table salt. It is important 

66
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,110
that the number of 

67
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,410
electrons exchanged is always identical. 

68
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,430
That was easy here. But what if 

69
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,790
you choose a different pair 

70
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,530
? Let's take 

71
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,110
aluminum and oxygen, for example . 
Aluminum 

72
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,070
gives up three electrons. 

73
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,010
However, an oxygen atom can only accept 
two 

74
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,450
electrons. 

75
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,650
So we need more atoms. Since the number of 

76
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,370
electrons exchanged 

77
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,470
must be identical , we simply multiply 

78
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,210
2 and 3, which 

79
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,470
gives us 6 as the common denominator. Two 
aluminum atoms 

80
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,390
give up 6 electrons and three 

81
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,730
oxygen atoms take up 6 electrons 

82
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,910
. The resulting salt is therefore 

83
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,230
Al2U3. These indices are only 

84
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,890
noted if they 

85
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,230
differ from one another. So the correct 

86
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,130
spelling of calcium sulphide is CAS 

87
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,470
and not CA2S2. Finally, the 

88
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,310
summary. First, binary 

89
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,430
salts are composed of metal ions 

90
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,750
and non-metal ions. 

91
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,950
Second, metal atoms give 

92
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,170
off electrons. Third, 

93
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,210
 non-metal atoms accept electrons. 

94
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,050
Fourthly, the number of 

95
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,050
ions exchanged must 

96
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,890
be identical. Fifthly 

97
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,090
, if the number of the respective ions 
differs , 

98
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,190
their number is indicated by indices. 

99
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,490
I hope that you now have a better 

100
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,410
understanding of how binary sides 

101
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,890
are formed. If you still have questions
