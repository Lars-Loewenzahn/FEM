00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,390
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,670
Schülerhilfe webinar. 

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,470
Today we want to 

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,810
look at the German sentence. This means 
that we will 

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,510
first look at the types of sentences, 

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,810
then we will look at which 

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,990
sentences there are and which 
sub-sentences 

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,870
we can structure, which 

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,110
sentence elements the sentences consist of 
and 

10
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,930
how we 

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,650

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,530
can recognize the individual sentence 
elements with the help of the Umstellprobe 
. Let's move on to the types of sentences. 

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,890
Sentence types are primarily 

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,110
different ways 

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,790
of expressing something. We can see five 

16
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,390
examples here : the declarative sentence, 

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,410
the interrogative sentence, the request 
sentence, 

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,250
the exclamatory sentence and the request 
sentence. 

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,310
We can see that in addition to the 

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,370
punctuation, i.e. the 

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,670
end of the sentence, 

22
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,410
the verb and the general 

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,370
order of the clauses also change. This 
means the 

24
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,530
position of the individual elements in the 

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,230
sentence. In the declarative sentence, 

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,010
we 

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,230
have Jana likes to eat chocolate. This 
means 

28
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,430
that we have our subject, then our 
predicate, 

29
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,510
then an adverb and then our 

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,930
object. The 

31
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,130
verb, here inflected, i.e. the predicate, 
is in the 

32
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,950
normal indicative. 

33
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,150
Indicative means meaningful. So 

34
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,990
here we have a declarative sentence. So 
here we have 

35
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,710
a predicate that is made. 

36
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,710
Unlike in the interrogative sentence. Here 

37
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,110
the verb, i.e. the inflected verb, 

38
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,510
is called the predicate, the predicate 
moves to the 

39
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,590
beginning and we have a question mark 

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,610
instead of a period. The sentence 

41
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,830
changes slightly. Does Jana like 

42
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,010
chocolate? So we also raise 

43
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,110
our voice. We make it clear 

44
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,750
that this is an interrogative sentence 

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,090
. In other words, we don't know 

46
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,890
whether she likes chocolate. In other 
words, we're 

47
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,670
asking. This is such an... 

48
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,190
interrogative sentence. The 

49
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,110
request sentence is 

50
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,150
different again. 

51
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,650
The verb clearly changes its mode. 

52
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,350
That is, it is 

53
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,730

54
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,190
turned from the indicative, as in these 
two initial examples, into the imperative. 
That is, 

55
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,290
into the imperative form. Jana, is your 

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,550
chocolate a request, an 

57
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,830
appeal, a command and an order. 

58
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,490
Then we have the exclamatory sentence A. 

59
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,290
So Jana likes chocolate. Here 

60
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,950
we want to make an emphatic 

61
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,290
statement. So unlike 

62
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,710
in the declarative sentence, where we 

63
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,530

64
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,330

65
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,730
make a statement soberly without any 
evaluation, without any kind of intention 
, here we already have 

66
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,510
an intention 

67
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,910
characterized by the fact that we 

68
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,130
have an interjection like A and an 

69
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,730
exclamation mark at the end of the 
sentence. 

70
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,530
So here we are making a 

71
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,490
statement with astonishment and 

72
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,210
realization. In the wishful sentence, 

73
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,870
in addition to an if, we 

74
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,390
also 

75
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,710
find the verb in the subjunctive . This 
means 

76
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,530
that the entire sentence construction 
changes here, 

77
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,050
as we 

78
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,030
have already seen above. So if Jana likes 
to 

79
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,430
eat chocolate, we 

80
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,830
always have the chocolate at the end of 
the sentence. Here, 

81
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,530
however, 

82
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,450

83
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,250

84
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,450
we find the S next to, or rather after, 
the actual chocolate, i.e. the object of 
the sentence. 

85
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,870
This is because we 

86
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,590
have an if-phrase here , which means that 
we are 

87
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,930
expressing a possibility, i.e. 

88
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,070
a wish-phrase. This means that a 

89
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,530
wish is ultimately just the 

90
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,550
expression of a possibility and the 

91
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,130
wish says that one of the 

92
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,410
existing possibilities 

93
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,630
should come true . In other words, that 
you 

94
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,570
have a certain preference. 

95
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,850
If Jana likes chocolate, 

96
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,850
then she would probably like this 

97
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,710
chocolate cake. In other words 

98
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,810
, you are setting a condition, a 

99
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,750
wish, a possibility. 

100
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,690
So we can see that, in addition to the 

101
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,730
different punctuation marks, 

102
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,670
the verb also changes and the 

103
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,550
individual sentence elements also 

104
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,750
move around a little in the sentence, 
although we 

105
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,770
can see that in 

106
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,410
most cases the predicate 

107
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,690
is at the beginning , except for the wish 
sentence, and that 

108
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,610
the chocolate, as in all sentences 

109
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,750
, i.e. the object, 

110
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,030
is always at the end of the sentence. Now 
let's move on to the 

111
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,810
different types of sentences and then 

112
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,990
we will also realize why we 

113
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,030

114
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,030
have this different sentence order here. 

115
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,450
In German, we 

116
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,370
distinguish between a main clause and a 
subordinate clause. 

117
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,610
A main clause 

118
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,830
can stand alone, it is sovereign 

119
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,750
and independent. We can see this in the 

120
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,710
example, Maria goes to her 

121
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,550
bedroom. We could even 

122
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,510
say Maria goes. Maria bakes, these 

123
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,450
are simple sentences, and 

124
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,490
we don't even need an object or 

125
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,930
, as here, an adverbial in the sense of 

126
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,530
a direction. We can 

127
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,170
say, okay, we have a 

128
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,910
prepositional object here , because we are 
saying 

129
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,270
going into something. But we can 

130
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,230
also 

131
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,350

132
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,650
declare the whole thing as an adverbial 
determination, where is she going. In 
other words, we 

133
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,510
have an accusative of direction in 

134
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,690
conjunction with a verb of 

135
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,110
movement. 

136
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,990
However, we don't want to dwell on that 
now , because 

137
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,470
we want to 

138
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,270
concentrate on something else. Namely on 
the 

139
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,610
difference between the main 

140
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,950
clause and the subordinate clause. We have 

141
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,510
established that the main clause 

142
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,650
can stand alone and the subordinate clause 

143
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,410
cannot. Why can't it 

144
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,670
stand alone? Because it 

145
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,570

146
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,450

147
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,010

148
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,550
is subordinated by a so-called 
conjunction, also called a subjunction, 
which is a subordination or a conjunction 
is a connective word. 

149
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,730
In other words, Maria goes to her 

150
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,210
bedroom because she is tired. The 

151
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,330
because she is tired indicates the reason 

152
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,970
why she goes. In other words, 

153
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,410
we can see that 

154
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,210
this is an adverbial clause, 

155
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,030
the because, which 

156
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,270
refers to the going. However, 

157
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,150
we cannot say this sentence on its own, 

158
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,910
as we always need the reference to 

159
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,070
our main predicate. So 

160
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,130
we need the reference to the Geh. 

161
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,410
In other words, we cannot say, because 

162
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,230
she is tired, because we 

163
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,070
have no origin at all. We can say 

164
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,130
that Mary walks because she is tired. 

165
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,370
We can say that. But here, if 

166
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,930
we have not named the predicate 

167
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,830
, we have no reference in our 

168
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,010
subordinate clause. 

169
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,270
In this case, it is an 

170
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,490
adverbial clause, or there are 

171
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,590
different types of subordinate clauses, 
for 

172
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,350
example relative clauses, where 

173
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,730
the subordinate clause does not refer to 
the 

174
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,390
predicate of the sentence, but for 

175
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,030
example to a noun such as 

176
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,090
bedroom, so Maria goes to the 

177
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,310
bedroom, which is cold, or 

178
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,510
which is cold, the room, so we have 

179
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,870
a connection to the 

180
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,750
bedroom here, but even that could 

181
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,410
not stand alone without us 

182
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,790
knowing that this is a 

183
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,070
bedroom. This means that 

184
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,690
Maria goes to her bedroom, which 

185
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,570
is cold, or Maria goes to her 

186
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,150
bedroom because she is tired, 

187
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,150

188
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,990

189
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,210
always needs a main clause , regardless of 
what is said in the subordinate clause . 

190
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,190
So we have learned that the subordinate 
clause 

191
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,770
can never stand alone because it is 

192
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,670
dependent on... words from the 

193
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,310
main clause and the main clause can 

194
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,770
stand alone because it is not 

195
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,590
dependent on other clauses. 

196
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,150
We differentiate 

197
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,370
between further sentence structures and 
sentence series, 

198
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,230
i.e. sentence arrangements in the big 
picture 

199
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,130

200
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,530
. Between the sentence series and the 

201
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,770
sentence structure, we find that we 

202
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,150

203
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,910
have connected two main clauses with each 
other on the one hand and 

204
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,170

205
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,890
connected a main clause with a subordinate 
clause in the sentence structure. Now 

206
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,510
we have just established that 

207
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,350
a main clause is independent. 

208
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,130
This means that the series of sentences 

209
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,470
only connects two independent main clauses 

210
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,250
. We can see this here in 

211
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
the example of Maria going into the 

212
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,890
bedroom and reading a book. 

213
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,930
So we can say 

214
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,690
that Maria goes into the bedroom and 

215
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,350
we can say that she reads a book. 

216
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,010
Or we can say Maria is reading 

217
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,750
a book. Of course, in order to avoid 
always 

218
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,410
and constantly 

219
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,390
repeating the subject, in this case Maria, 

220
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,250
or always 

221
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,230
finding a different meaning for it , Maria 
goes into the 

222
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,330
bedroom, the woman reads a 

223
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,310
book or the girl reads a book 

224
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,670
or the little girl, the boy reads a 

225
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,430
book, i.e. always 

226
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,610
finding a different word for our subject, 

227
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,750
we have the option of using 

228
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,270
a link here, the 

229
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,830
conjunction and 

230
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,370
to change these two main clauses with each 
other. 

231
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,510
link and thus the second time, 

232
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,650
i.e. the mention of the subject for the 

233
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,050
second time, i.e. again, in order to avoid 

234
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,330

235
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,230
mentioning the subject a second time. In 
other words, we 

236
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,730
can say Maria goes into the 

237
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,570
bedroom and reads a book. We 

238
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,230
don't have to mention again that 

239
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,030
this is Maria. In this way, 

240
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,110
we can combine several main clauses that 

241
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,610
have the same subject or 

242
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,190
that basically 

243
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,190
have the same reference word in the 
sentence, as in this case 

244
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,170
the subject, we have 

245
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,770
the option of using the AND 

246
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,290
to connect these two main clauses 

247
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,850
and do not have to 

248
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,930
mention the subject again. Other 
subordinating 

249
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,570
conjunctions are aber, oder, sowie, 

250
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,570
auch noch und liest auch noch ein 

251
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,230
Buch, you could say. So 

252
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,670
here we have and as the most important and 

253
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,110
as the best-known link. 

254
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,990
It's different in the sentence structure. 
There we have 

255
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,310
Maria goes to the bedroom 

256
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,950
because she is tired. Here we have 

257
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,850
a subordinating conjunction, 

258
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,490
a so-called subjunction. 

259
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,630
We have da, also da, weil, sodass, 

260
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:19,250
obwohl, jedoch and so on. Yes, 

261
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,930
but also works. So we have 

262
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,650
a dependency here. The subordinate clause 
is 

263
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,590
dependent and the main clause is 

264
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,590
independent. However, we can 

265
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,430
construct a sentence structure by 

266
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,790

267
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,430
naming a main clause with a subordinate 
clause. We can 

268
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,110
also add several 

269
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,830
subordinate clauses. So we can 

270
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,010

271
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,710
combine several subordinate clauses in a 
sentence structure , just as we can 

272
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,410

273
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,890
combine several main clauses in a sentence 
series. In other words, 

274
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,730
it is 

275
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,590
important for us to understand that 

276
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,490
a series of sentences consists of several 

277
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,890
main clauses and a 

278
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,070
sentence structure consists of a main 
clause and 

279
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,810
subordinate clauses or a 

280
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,990
subordinate clause. We must 

281
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,450
always pay attention to the conjunction. 

282
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,830
We differentiate 

283
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,830
between subordinating 

284
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,050

285
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,710
conjunctions and subordinating 
conjunctions. Now let's move on to the 

286
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,870
clauses. We have already 

287
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,350
talked about this at the beginning and 
have 

288
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,370
already 

289
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,210
analyzed the individual sentence elements 
and there we 

290
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,610
came across a few technical terms, namely 

291
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,810
predicate, subject, We see them 

292
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,110
arranged here in this way because they 

293
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,050
are in the general sentence order. 

294
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,790
The general sentence order of the German 

295
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,410
sentence is subject, predicate, 

296
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,650
object and adverbial clause. 

297
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,970
We need to know that the 

298
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,690
adverbial clause can also follow 

299
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,770
the predicate and the object 

300
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,730
can come at the end of the sentence. What 

301
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,810
is important for us, however, is 

302
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,230
this core. That means subject, 

303
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,110
predicate, object. We have 

304
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,470
learned that the dependencies of 

305
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,830
subordinate clauses 

306
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,570

307
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,210
are either with the subject or object, as 
in relative clauses, for example, or 

308
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,050
with the predicate , as in adverbial 
clauses. 

309
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,370
This means that this is where 

310
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,890
subordinate clauses are linked. 

311
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,930
The subject is the 

312
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,590
subject of the sentence, i.e. the doer in 
the 

313
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,730
sentence. This is always 

314
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,350
stated in the nominative case . means who 
or what. The 

315
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,150
predicate is the sentence statement or the 

316
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,650
action, comes from the part of speech, 

317
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,110
so it is a 

318
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,010
verb . I have already said that. 

319
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,250
We have learned that a 

320
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,410
predicate 

321
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,150

322
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,570

323
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,550
is an inflected verb, i.e. a verb that is 
adapted to a subject and a sentence. So, 
an object is a 

324
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,510
so-called sentence complement. That is, 

325
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,330
so, if we like, either a 

326
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,910
sentence complement or an acted upon, 

327
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,690
an originator and an addressee. That 

328
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,310
is, someone to whom the action applies. 

329
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,830
For example, if I say, I'll help 

330
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,130
you, then the addressee is the 

331
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,290
dative object, in this case 

332
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,430
you. This means that we have 

333
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,510
an addressee here. Or we have a 

334
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,910
traded object, for example, if I 

335
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,070
say I bake a cake, then 

336
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,810
the cake is the one 

337
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,070
being baked . So we have different 

338
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,290
types of object, and we differentiate 

339
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,890
between the genitive, the dative, the 

340
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,770
accusative object and the 

341
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,910
prepositional object in combination with 

342
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,090
a preposition. We remember 

343
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,470
the example of 

344
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,070
going into the bedroom. We have 

345
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,310
different and here we need to 

346
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,350
briefly mention that these 

347
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,430
objects result from the predicate. 

348
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,010
This means that in most cases 

349
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,790
it is an accusative. We have 

350
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,990
just 

351
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,150
seen an example with, for example, helfen 
with the dative case. 

352
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,950
However, we can also use a 

353
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,790
genitive object, such 

354
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,690
as ich erinnere mich der 

355
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,950
schönen Zeit. Or I am enjoying 

356
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,290
the best of health. Here we need 

357
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,850
a genitive object. An adverbial 

358
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,130
clause is a 

359
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,390
description of circumstances. This means 
that it 

360
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,950
adds further things. 

361
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,730
We'll take a closer look at this in a 
moment 

362
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,430
. So far, we'll 

363
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,290
just leave it as a description of 
circumstances 

364
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,250
and note that 

365
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,970

366
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,070
the adverbial clause 

367
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,230

368
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,230
can also be mentioned as an independent 
sentence structure alongside the subject, 
the predicate and the object. However, it 
should be 

369
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,010
noted that the adverbial clause 

370
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,150
is an addition. This means that it is 

371
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,030
not necessary in the sentence. While 

372
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,190
the subject, predicate and object 

373
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,450

374
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,690

375
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,210

376
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,190
are necessary for the sentence, depending 
on whether the verb needs an object , 
which is called transitivity . Here is an 

377
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,310
example sentence. Subject, predicate, 

378
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,990
object, then prepositional, genitive, 

379
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,130
dative, accusative, object. In the first 

380
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,170
example, we find a 

381
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,390
prepositional object. The 

382
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,790
neighbor 's son is waiting for the 
messenger. Here 

383
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,770
we have the neighbor's son. Here 

384
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,770
we come to why we 

385
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,810

386
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,250
have only talked about these four sentence 
clues . Of course we have 

387
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,090
the neighbor here. This is a 

388
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,610
so-called genitive object. 

389
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,210
Sorry, it's a 

390
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,630
so-called genitive attribute. But 

391
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,730
this genitive attribute, because 

392
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,070
it's an attribute 

393
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,850
, it counts or becomes part of the 

394
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,870
subject. In other words, we note 

395
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,030
that a subject 

396
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,270

397
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,150

398
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,650

399
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,450
can not only necessarily consist of a noun 
and an article or a pronoun or a 
possessive pronoun , but that it can also 

400
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,410
be enriched with attributes. 

401
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,450
So here we have the 

402
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,030
neighbor 's son as the object, waits as 
the 

403
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,510
predicate, for the letter carrier as the 

404
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,130
prepositional object. Then we 

405
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,050
now have an accusative object. Er möchte, 

406
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,890
yes here subject, first part of the 

407
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,470
predicate, so here primarily 

408
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,210
a modality, like, er möchte 

409
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,270
ihm ein Weihnachtsgeschenk 

410
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,110
überreichen. In other words, we have 

411
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,190
ihm as a dative object here. This 

412
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,890
is also called an indirect object, because 
we 

413
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,330
could also say he would like to 

414
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,250
give him a Christmas present, but 

415
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,310

416
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,910
we couldn 't say he would like to give him 
a present. This means that we 

417
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,030
also have to 

418
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,870
differentiate between indirect and direct 
objects. 

419
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,710
We simply 

420
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,970
determine which of these two objects 

421
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,150
is necessary and which is not. The 

422
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,130
indirect object is not necessary, the 

423
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,030
direct object is necessary. 

424
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,010
So we realize that a 

425
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,810
Christmas present is 

426
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,610
necessary as an accusative and that is in 

427
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,490
second place if we 

428
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,310
have two objects , such as the indirect 
and 

429
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,050
direct object here , i.e. dative and 

430
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,850
accusative. As a 

431
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,850
rule of thumb , we can also remember that 
in 

432
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,970
most cases, when we have a dative 

433
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,650
and an accusative, it 

434
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,370
always depends on how 

435
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,090
the transitivity, I 

436
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,430
just explained that 

437
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,730
transitivity is about 

438
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,210
which case, i.e. which object 

439
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,910
the individual verb stands with . The 

440
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,730
accusative object, the direct 

441
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,170
object and the indirect object 

442
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,450
are usually the dative case. Now let's 

443
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,650
take a look at a genitive object. Here 

444
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,730
we already had the example 

445
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,370
I just gave. 

446
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,290
The letter carrier is in good 

447
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,790
health. So we can see 

448
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,490
that sentence elements 

449
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,970
can be combined in different ways , i.e. 
they 

450
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,530
can be linked together. 

451
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,310
We have also 

452
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,150
learned something new, and that is that we 
have 

453
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,430
discovered that 

454
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,210
the neighbor, which we will come to 

455
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,630
in a moment, 

456
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,690
is an attribute, which I just wanted to 

457
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,170
clarify here in the example, 

458
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,310
that this attribute, namely the 

459
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,650
genitive attribute, 

460
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,930
becomes part of the subject in this case 
because it 

461
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,030
is attached to the subject. 

462
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,720
This means that we also have to 

463
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,860
differentiate 

464
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,500
between there are attributes on the one 
hand and 

465
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,480
objects on the other. This means that the 

466
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,360
genitive can be both. 

467
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Now let's move on to the adverbial 

468
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,780
clauses that we have just discussed 

469
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,340
. Adverbial 

470
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,640
determinations, as we 

471
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,260
have seen , are several descriptions 

472
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,460
of the verb, i.e. the action. This 

473
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,360
means that we have a reference to 

474
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,020
our predicate. 

475
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,760
We distinguish between four categories of 
adverbial 

476
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,860
determination of time, place, 

477
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,200
manner and reason. That 

478
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,680
is, here we are talking about 

479
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,740
temporal, local, modal and causal. 

480
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,600
So, we have individual signal words. 

481
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
For example, we see time. These 

482
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,280
can be things like today, last 

483
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,280
night, at 10 o'clock in the morning, in 
the morning. 

484
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,600
That is, in 2014, which means that 

485
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,800
we have different 

486
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,460
time specifications here. These are 

487
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,500
adverbial determiners. We can 

488
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,760
form sentences by 

489
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,420
omitting these time specifications. 

490
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,980
However, we can 

491
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,120
also add time specifications . 

492
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,520
On the one hand, they can, but to 

493
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,420
put it simply , they 

494
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,520
are usually 

495
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,880

496
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,660

497
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,960
formed, as we see here with the adverbial 
determination of time , with an article 
and a noun, yes, or 

498
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,240
also with a preposition as here, 

499
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,840
i.e. preposition, article and 

500
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,100
noun. Here we 

501
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,060
also have an adjective, i.e. a 

502
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,500
worse attribute. In addition to the time, 

503
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,420
there is also the place, the manner and 

504
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,000
the reason. Here is 

505
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,580
an example of the reason. 

506
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,420
I was 

507
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,240
grounded for a week because of the bad 
grade. We 

508
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,660
reduce the sentence to the 

509
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,240
essential sentence elements. I was 

510
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,720
grounded. We realize that 

511
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,680
adverbial determination changes 

512
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,980
the sentence structure. While we 

513
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,520
normally 

514
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,280
have subject, predicate and object, we can 

515
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,180

516
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,640

517
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,620
put the adverbial clause at the beginning 
, the predicate is always in 

518
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,560
second place, if we 

519
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,660
reverse this , then the subject must be in 

520
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,520
third place and then there is 

521
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,180
another adverbial clause 

522
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,260
and then at the end, who or 

523
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,160
what was I 

524
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,520
grounded, that is, 

525
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
the accusative object, that is, the 

526
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,980
direct object is usually always 

527
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,560
at the end of the sentence. So, 

528
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,400
of course , we can also say, 

529
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
I was 

530
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,980
grounded for a week because of the bad 
grade, but 

531
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,000
then we 

532
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,620
go by linguistic feeling. 

533
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,820
However, we can remember that 

534
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,480
, as a rule , we first 

535
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,880

536
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,800
have the time, then the reason, then the 
manner and then the place. If 

537
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,620
we 

538
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,360
want to string together a lot of adverbial 
clauses 

539
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,120
, we can memorize them in this 

540
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,500
order. Now let's move on to 

541
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,040
the attributes. We have just 

542
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,700
learned about one, 

543
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,020
the genitive attribute, and we have 

544
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,220
just 

545
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,340
learned about an adjective , which is also 
an 

546
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,240
attribute. An attribute 

547
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,340
is a more detailed description and 

548
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,020
we have just learned that 

549
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,460
it becomes part of the clause. Let's 

550
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,560
look at two 

551
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,820
clarifying examples again . The 

552
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,140
chirping bird is sitting in the tree 

553
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,320
or my neighbor's dog 

554
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,580
is always barking loudly. Here it is the 
case that 

555
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,520
Zwitschern consists of Vogel, which 

556
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,480
means that here we have the subject der 

557
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,380
zwitschernde Vogel and here we have 

558
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,240
a genitive object on Hund. 

559
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,820
So let's see what the 

560
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,260
difference is. Attributes can We 

561
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,560
can 

562
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,700
consist of adjectives on the one hand. 
Adjectives are separate 

563
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,360
word types that 

564
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,420
add properties to nouns. Or we 

565
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,280
can use the genitive case, 

566
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,980
mostly here for example, so like 

567
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,120
here, for example, through a 

568
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,420
possessive pronoun. or we could 

569
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,160
also say the neighbor's dog, 

570
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,240
so through an article in the genitive case 

571
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,520
and then another noun, 

572
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,120
attributes, 

573
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,620
either adjectives as 

574
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,400
well as whole nouns and articles or 

575
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
possessive pronouns. We can also 

576
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,860
form whole relative clauses, as we 

577
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,020
have just seen in the introduction 

578
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,480
. Strictly 

579
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,760
speaking, of course, these are all 
attributes. They 

580
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
are subordinate clauses, of course, but 

581
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,220
these subordinate clauses 

582
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,280
are to be treated as attributes because 
they are attached to 

583
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,060
a noun. We can 

584
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,740
say, the dog that 

585
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,820
belongs to my neighbor always barks 
loudly. 

586
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,520
That means that my neighbor's dog is 

587
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,020
an attributive dependent clause, 

588
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,040
i.e. a relative clause, and refers 

589
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,960
to dog here. I think that's 

590
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,100
clear so far. Now let's move on to 

591
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,240
how we can find out which 

592
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,860
clause it is. 

593
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,280
Let's take a look at different 

594
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
methods. Let's start with the 

595
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,400
interrogative test. With the interrogative 
test 

596
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,680
, we 

597
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,040

598
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,740
can basically ask about all sentence 
elements and all individual functions. 
After the 

599
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,660
subject, we usually ask who or 

600
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,900
what. We ask about the predicate 

601
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,300
, i.e. the verb was, was, was tun Sie, 

602
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,200
was. geschieht, was wird getan. After 

603
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,060
the dative we always ask whom. 

604
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,200
For example, here for the birthday we ask 

605
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,300
with wozu. That means we ask 

606
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,340
for the purpose. 

607
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,140
So the accusative after whom or what. 

608
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,320
So we can ask who or what is 

609
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,500
doing something, to whom, what for, whom 
or what. 

610
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,380
Of course, that doesn't even 

611
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,580
make sense. That's why we have to 

612
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,560
ask individual questions and 

613
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,180
pick up the remaining parts of the 
sentence. In other words, who 

614
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,440
or what gave her 

615
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,540
a huge bouquet of flowers for her birthday 
? Her 

616
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,380
colleagues gave her a 

617
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,660
huge bouquet of flowers for her birthday . 
Who 

618
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,320
did her colleagues give her 

619
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,920
a huge 

620
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,320
bouquet of flowers for her birthday ? Why 
did her colleagues give her 

621
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,620
a huge bouquet of flowers 

622
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,480
for her birthday? Who did her colleagues 
give 

623
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,760

624
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,140
her a huge bouquet of flowers for her ? In 
other words, we see 

625
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,940
that we 

626
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,740

627
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,600
can use the interrogative test to ask 
about the individual sentence elements. We 
can also 

628
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,520

629
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
use the transposition test. In doing so, 
we swap the 

630
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,500
individual sentence elements and we 

631
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,580
realize how we 

632
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,940
have to construct the sentence and where 
the individual 

633
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,500
sentence elements are located. In doing 
so, we have 

634
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,900
established or always 

635
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
establish that the predicate always 

636
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,120
comes second. That is very 

637
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,420
important. And that, for 

638
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,700
example , when we start with, here we have 

639
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,620
the subject, here we have the 

640
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,220
object and here we have the 

641
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,600
adverbial clause. In other words, we 

642
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,900
realize that if we 

643
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,540
have the subject here , the general 

644
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,420
sentence order follows. In other words, 

645
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,320
we have the object here, then we have 

646
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,200
an adverbial clause here and 

647
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,240
then we have an 

648
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,740
object here again. We have already 

649
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,240
established that there is an 

650
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,140
indirect object and a 

651
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,060
direct object. We have already 

652
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,640
explained how this works. I 

653
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,200
hope that is also clear. 

654
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,260
So if the subject 

655
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,040
follows, that doesn't sound good. That's 

656
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,060
because we 

657
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,020
have an indirect object. So who can we put 
at 

658
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,060
the beginning? Subjects, direct 

659
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,760
objects and alphabale determination. 

660
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,620
This changes in such a way that 

661
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,360
the subject follows the predicate if the 
subject 

662
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,900
is not at the beginning 

663
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,120
. and otherwise, as we would have to 

664
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,580
put it here, 

665
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,180
send your colleagues to 

666
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,580
Blumenstraß for their birthday , here we 
find 

667
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,260
that the special feature is that the 

668
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,520
subject has moved to the end 

669
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,080
and that we 

670
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
have the indirect object here and then 

671
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,300
have the direct object here , that is, we 

672
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,440
have found that 

673
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,640
the sentence structure is basically such 

674
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,160
that we 

675
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,940
have the subject at the beginning or it 
moves directly after the 

676
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,860
predicate. 

677
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,780
We 

678
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,280
have 

679
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,720

680
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,800
it after the predicate or if we have it 
like in this context, for her birthday, 
her colleagues give her a bouquet of 
flowers, that we have it in such a way 

681
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,300
that we 

682
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,160
bundle the main clause elements at the end 
to emphasize that we 

683
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,760
have the adverbial clause here, 

684
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,620
then the indirect object and then 

685
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,320
the subject and the object. 

686
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,300
So we basically have it like this and can 

687
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,020
remember 

688
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,440
that we actually have the most important 
sentence elements 

689
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
at the beginning. 

690
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,360
However, if we want to swap it around, 

691
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,580
we can also put the most important 

692
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,280
sentence elements at the end. 

693
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,160
However, we should remember that 

694
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,900
the predicate always comes second 

695
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,300
. Okay, we can do this with 

696
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,500
the help of the transposition test. The 

697
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,140
general replacement test shows us 

698
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,920
that we 

699
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,560
can exchange individual sentence elements 

700
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,040
and thus also shows us 

701
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,100
which of the individual sentence elements 
we are dealing 

702
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,380
with here. Let 

703
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,420
's take an example. Your colleagues 

704
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,500
are now giving you a huge 

705
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,900
bouquet of flowers. We can 

706
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,820
exchange the subject and the predicate. 

707
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,080
They gave her. They gave. Then we have 

708
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,540
the dative object here. 

709
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,140
Gave her a huge bunch of flowers for her 
birthday 

710
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,180
. Her colleagues gave 

711
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,740
her a huge 

712
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,560
bunch of flowers for her birthday . We 
could say that her colleagues 

713
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,360
gave Maria a 

714
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
huge 

715
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
bunch of flowers for her birthday . Her 
colleagues gave 

716
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,160
her a huge 

717
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,040
bouquet of flowers for her birthday . Or 
we could say that 

718
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,780
her colleagues gave someone a 

719
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,220
birthday present . That's another 

720
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,880
very good clue here , because here 

721
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,900
we have, we could even 

722
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,560
say , if we wanted to, that someone gave 

723
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,640
someone something for their birthday. 

724
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
In other words, we have made it clear here 

725
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,040
that we 

726
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,360

727
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,240

728
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,260
can also generalize the general, i.e. the 
direct sentence songs. We can remember 

729
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,900
that you can either 

730
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,840
say someone or something here. With the 
dative 

731
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
we say someone and with the 

732
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,460
nominative we say somebody. This helps 

733
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,560
us to determine the individual sentence 
elements 

734
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,480
and also helps us to 

735
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,880
better recognize the sentence in the 
formulation 

736
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
. So today we have 

737
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,500
learned that there are different 

738
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,180
types of sentences. We have 

739
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,320
discovered that there are sentence types 

740
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,500
with different intentions 

741
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,240
, i.e. with different 

742
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,440
purposes. 

743
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,900
The statement and 

744
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,140
the interrogative sentence are the most 
popular and 

745
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,200
most common. 

746
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,900
The request sentence expresses a request 

747
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,340
. The exclamatory sentence states 
something 

748
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,720
with astonishment and 

749
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,240
realization. And the request sentence 

750
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,780
formulates something in the subjunctive 

751
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,460
, i.e. in the possible form. 

752
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,960
This means that something is wished for. 

753
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,880
We then established 

754
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,200
that there are different types of 
sentences 

755
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,420
. We differentiate 

756
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,660
between the main clause and the 

757
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,460
subordinate clause. We can therefore see 

758
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,680
that the main clause 

759
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,980
can stand alone , as it contains the 
subject, predicate and object 

760
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,900
, and that the subordinate clause 

761
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
usually refers to a sentence element of 
the 

762
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,060
main clause. This means that it 

763
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,940
cannot stand alone. We have 

764
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,400
the option of 

765
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
combining several main clauses in a series 
of sentences . To do this, 

766
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,440
we use so-called conjunctions 

767
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,300
such as UNS, SOWI or AUCH. In 

768
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,780
sentence structures, we 

769
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,620
have a main clause and 

770
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,200
can add subordinate clauses . This means 
that a 

771
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,540
sentence structure consists of a 

772
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,200
main clause and at least one 

773
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,360
subordinate clause. The main clause and 

774
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,900
subordinate clause are linked by a 

775
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,640
subordinating conjunction. That is, 

776
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,680
a subordinating conjunction, 

777
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,700
such as because, since, although or 

778
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,380
nevertheless. We have looked at the 

779
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,380
different parts of the sentence 

780
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,900
and have established 

781
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,740
that the subject 

782
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,860
is the doer in the sentence and is 
expressed in the nominative case 

783
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,280
, the predicate is the verb in the 
sentence 

784
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,600
, which is inflected and which 

785
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,480
usually also tells us 

786
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,060
which object we need. 

787
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,580
For example, we have 

788
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,080
established that helfen 

789
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,060
needs a dative and write an accusative 

790
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,480
or, for example, gehen a 

791
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,860
prepositional. object or for 

792
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,340
example erinnern a genitive object. 

793
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,140
So we also talked about the 

794
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,980
objects that 

795
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,360
are inevitably indicated by the predicate. 

796
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,800
This means that when we say write 
something 

797
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,500
, we know that something, 

798
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,200
which we have 

799
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,220

800
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,900
learned here in the conversion test or in 
the replacement test. When I say write 
something 

801
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,460
, I mean an 

802
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,380
accusative. This means that I can 

803
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,820
use an accusative for something. 

804
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,580
We then looked at the 

805
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,220
two subordinate clauses 

806
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,580
, namely the adverbials and the 

807
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,240
attributes. We 

808
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,620
discovered that the difference 

809
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,140
between the two is 

810
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,800
that adverbial clauses 

811
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,880
are independent clauses and that 
attributes 

812
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,180
are attached to other clauses. 

813
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,260
The adverbial 

814
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,900
clause 

815
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,860
always 

816
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,220
refers to the predicate in terms of its 
origin. We also saw this in 

817
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,720
the example of adverbial clauses. 

818
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,760
This means that because 

819
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,060
she is tired refers to walking. And we 

820
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,700
have established 

821
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,370
that an adverb beautiful or 

822
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:03,670
chirping or my neighbor 

823
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,830

824
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,990
refers to the subject in this case. 
However, we have also 

825
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,490
discovered that it does not 

826
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,510
necessarily have to be the case that an 
attribute 

827
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,810
only 

828
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,130
refers to a subject. We have also learned 

829
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,350
that relative clauses are attributes. 

830
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,630
These are also 

831
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,310
subordinate clauses, but they 

832
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,230
can also be connected to objects or 

833
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,970
subjects. This means that they 

834
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,770
define the individual sentence elements, 

835
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,290
i.e. subject or object, in more detail. 

836
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,810
Finally, we looked at the 

837
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,330
three circumstances and three methods 

838
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,370
that make it clear to us 

839
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,130
which clause it is and 

840
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,490
how we 

841
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,350
can find out the individual clauses . 

842
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,090
We asked the interrogative test with the 
individual 

843
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,710
questions about the corresponding 

844
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,710
sentence elements. We did the 

845
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,990
changeover test and 

846
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,010
found that the sentence order 

847
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,690
can change, but that it 

848
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,550
is already such that the predicate always 

849
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,350
comes second. And we 

850
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,870
have found that we 

851
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,450

852
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,850
can also find other words for the 
different parts of the sentence. I would 
like to 

853
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,610
thank you for your attention 

854
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,570
and take my leave.
