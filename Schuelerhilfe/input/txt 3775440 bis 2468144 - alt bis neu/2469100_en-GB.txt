00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello, my name is Paula and I 

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,240
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,660
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,640
explain to you what 

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,920
proteins are all about in chemistry. In 
our 

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,720
online learning center you will 

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,280
of course also find a wiki on this topic 

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,860
, in which the 

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,420
basic and important terms 

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,860
are explained in more detail. Proteins are 

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,480
an essential part of our 

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,200
diet and you are probably 

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,420
most familiar with proteins in connection 

14
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,240
with muscle building. However, 

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,140
proteins are not only essential for 
athletes, 

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,860
but for everyone. 

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,280
We should 

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,780

19
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,520
consume at least 0.8 to 1 g of protein per 
kg of body weight every day . But what 

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,180
exactly are proteins and why does 

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,840
our body need them? Proteins 

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
are made up of amino acids. Amino acids 
have 

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,160
a basic structure consisting of an acidic 

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,020
carboxyl group, a basic 

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,180
amino group and an H ion. 

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,220
In addition, a variable C atom is attached 
to their central 

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,800
body. C atom is a variable residue R, 

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
which 

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,240
is specific to the respective amino acid. 
21 Amino acids are 

30
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,100
proteinogenic, i.e. they are the 

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,800
building blocks of proteins. 

32
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,420
The body cannot 

33
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,260
produce some amino acids itself, which is 
why it 

34
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,640
is dependent on a daily supply. These are 

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,180
known as essential 

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,680
amino acids. Proteins and their 

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,580
function are largely determined by the 

38
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,920
various side groups. 

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,240
Let's 

40
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,800
take a closer look at some possible 
residues. These can 

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,140
have sulphur bound as a side chain. These 
include the amino acids 

43
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,680
cysteine and methionine. 

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,280
Hydroxyl groups can also 

45
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,840
be bound to the central C atom. 

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
Additional amino groups in the 

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,660
side chain make the amino acid 

48
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,940
basic, while additional 

49
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,400
carboxyl groups 

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,920
make the amino acid acidic . The 
interaction of 

51
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
different side chains and the 

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,380
resulting bonds is 

53
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,820
decisive for the structure of a 

54
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,620
protein. But how do the 

55
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,040
amino acids become a protein? The 

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,000
connection of two amino acids by 

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,900
splitting off water is called 

58
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,740
a peptide bond. The 

59
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,820
carboxyl group and amino group react 

60
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,540
with each other. This bond is planar 

61
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,220
and cannot be freely rotated. The 

62
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,920
linking of two amino acids 

63
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,800
is referred to as a dipeptide. 

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,920
Up to 10 linked amino acids form 

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,500
an oligopeptide and more than 10 are 

66
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
referred to as polypeptides. These 

67
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,640
polypeptides form the basic structure 

68
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,500
of proteins. In the formation of 

69
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,180
proteins, a distinction is made between 

70
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,880
the primary, secondary, tertiary and 

71
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,120
quaternary structure. The 

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,080
primary structure is characterized by 

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,800
the simple sequence of 

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,620
amino acids. The secondary structure is 

75
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,660
formed by the formation of 

76
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,240
hydrogen bonds. 

77
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,120
The polypeptide can 

78
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,320
attach itself in an alpha-helix structure, 
which 

79
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,000
you may recognize from DNA, 

80
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,660
or in a beta-sheet structure. 

81
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,680
The tertiary structure is 

82
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,180
characterized by the formation of 

83
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,220
further bonds, which are mainly 

84
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,980

85
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,480
determined by the variable side chains of 
the amino acids. 

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,780
Van der Waals forces, 

87
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,940
disulfide bridges or ionic bonds 

88
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,360
play a role here. This results in the 
spatial 

89
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,440
arrangement of the structure. If 

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,300
several such tertiary structures 

91
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,440
are specifically arranged together, the 

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,800
quaternary structure is formed . But what 
exactly do 

93
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,380
we need proteins for ? 

94
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,680
They fulfill many tasks in the 

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,520
organism, so we 

96
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,100
can only go into some of them in more 
detail here. For example, 

97
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,500
proteins are involved in numerous 

98
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,440
metabolic processes that 

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
also 

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,860

101
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,760
produce the energy for our entire body, 
adenosine trifosphate, or ATP for short. 
They accelerate 

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,260
chemical reactions as 

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,160
biocatalysts. 

104
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,060
Proteins can also be used to produce 
hormones and 

105
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,260
signaling substances, which 

106
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,900

107
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,620
are important for controlling the organism 
. Proteins are essential for 

108
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,720
building cellular structures such as 

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,760
the cell membrane, for immune defense, 

110
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,220
for blood clotting and for much 

111
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,500
more. One last important point 

112
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,140
that we want to discuss today is 

113
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,860
that proteins easily 

114
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,540
denature when exposed to heat. An altered 
pH 

115
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,360
 value can also 

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,300

117
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,840
lead to denaturation and thus to 
inactivation of the protein. The body 
therefore tries to 

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,000

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,240
keep the pH value and body temperature 
very constant. Incidentally, this is 
exactly what happens 

121
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,380
when you heat an egg 

122
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,540
in a pan. The 

123
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,020
protein inside denatures, the 

124
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,820
spatial structure changes and 

125
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,200
the egg white turns white and solid. 

126
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,140
Denaturation can be reversible 

127
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,960
or irreversible. I hope 

128
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,360
that I have been able to help you 

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,760
understand this topic better.
