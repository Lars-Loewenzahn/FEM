00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,060
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,520
Schülerhilfe webinar on Reported 

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Speech. Today we are going to go 

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,800
through how we 

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,840
use indirect speech in English, how it 

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,560
is formed and how we deal with it 

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,880
when the reporting verb is 

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,420
used in the present and past tenses 

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,960
. We will also 

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,380
take a look at the so-called backshift of 

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,980
tenses. And finally, we'll take a look 

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,400
at how pronouns, place and 

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,700
tenses change in reported 

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,540
speech. But let's start with 

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,340
the application. What is reported 

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,780
speech? It's about 

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,400

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,440
reproducing what someone else has said. We 
can see this 

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,520
well here in an example. We have 

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,800
two people, a boy and a 

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,400
girl, who are talking to each other. 

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,800
The girl says I saw Julia 

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,220
yesterday and the next day 

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,180
the boy tells another 

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,040
girl that the girl says 

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,980
she saw Julia yesterday. And 

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,000
this girl says she saw Julia 

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,680
yesterday. This is 

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,460
indirect speech or 

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,800
reported speech in English. So, 

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,480
how is reported speech formed in 

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,160
English? It is always 

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,480
introduced by an accompanying clause 

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,600
with a reporting verb and a 

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,760
conjunction . In a declarative sentence, 

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,020
for example, this would be Mark says 

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,300
that he had a dog when he was little. 

38
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,080
Our reporting verb in this case is 

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,780
says. This 

40
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,140
introduces the reported speech. Our 

41
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,480
conjunction is that. 

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,840
We must note that as a conjunction, that 

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,060
can also be omitted. 

44
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,480
In this case, we would only have the 

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,320
reporting verb. 

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,410
If we 

47
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,070

48
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,210
want to present interrogative sentences 
without an interrogative word in indirect 
speech, we 

49
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,950
use asked, for example, as the 

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,770
reporting verb and 

51
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,970
if as the conjunction. So Jane asked if I 
wanted to go 

52
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,120
to the cinema with her. If we 

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,820
have interrogative sentences with an 
interrogative word 

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,700
, we use the 

55
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,240
interrogative word as the conjunction . 
For example, what. 

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,660
As in our example Steve wanted 

57
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,020
to know what we had planned for New 

58
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,860
Year's Eve. 

59
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,420
The reported verb in this case is 

60
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,080
wanted to know, but could of course 

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,400
also be asked, for example. So 

62
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,860
Steve asked what. If 

63
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,030
the reporting verb is in the present 
tense, 

64
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,930
the time of the literal speech 

65
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,050
in the indirect speech remains unchanged. 

66
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,870
For example, Julia, I am 

67
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,690
hungry. Our verb is am in the present 
tense. 

68
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,030
In indirect speech, it then 

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,270
looks like this. Julia says, 

70
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,970
so our reporting verb is in the present 
tense, that she 

71
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,130
is hungry. As the reporting verb is in the 

72
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,130
present tense, the tense of the 

73
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,550
literal speech remains unchanged. 

74
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,530
So both remain in the simple present. 

75
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,170
Exactly the same applies if 

76
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,570
the simple past is used in the literal 
speech 

77
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:20,830
. Mario says 

78
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,010
he ordered pizza last night. Says is 

79
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,230
in the present tense, so the reporting 
verb 

80
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,710
is in the present tense. This means that 
the verb 

81
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,750
in the literal 

82
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,830
speech remains unchanged in the indirect 
speech. 

83
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,750
So what happens when the reporting verb is 

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,870
in the past tense? Then 

85
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,850
we use the so-called 

86
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,190
backshift of tenses. If the 

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,250
reporting verb 

88
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,670
is in the past , for example in the simple 

89
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,830
past or past perfect, 

90
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,870
the tenses of the verbs 

91
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,810
change from direct to indirect speech. 

92
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,570
Simple present then becomes simple past, 

93
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,250
present perfect becomes past 

94
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,730
perfect, simple simple past 

95
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,410
also becomes past perfect and past 

96
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,830
perfect remains past perfect. Be 

97
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,450
going to and the infinitive becomes was 

98
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,390
or were going to and the infinitive 

99
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,370
and will with the infinitive becomes would 

100
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,810
with the infinitive. We have 

101
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,750
prepared a few examples. 

102
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,990
First, the backshift from simple 

103
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,170
present to simple past. We have the 

104
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,330
statement Jake, I like basketball. So 

105
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,070
like in the simple present. In 

106
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,390
indirect speech or reported speech 

107
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,170
, it is then Jake said he liked 

108
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,610
basketball. Said is the reporting 

109
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,650
verb and is in the simple past. 

110
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,250
This means that we use the 

111
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,810
backshift here and change like to 

112
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,630
liked. So, Jake said he liked 

113
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,990
basketball. And here you can also see 

114
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,430
that the That 

115
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:24,910
can be omitted . 

116
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,720
Present perfect becomes past 

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,780
perfect, so John. Janice has hurt 

118
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,520
her foot, has hurt in the present 

119
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,220
perfect. This becomes John said, 

120
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,040
Janice had hurt her foot. So past 

121
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,920
perfect in indirect speech. Exactly 

122
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,620
the same applies in the simple past. 

123
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,240
Here, too, it becomes the past perfect. So 

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,020
Mike, did Alex send you a message 

125
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:11,320
last night? Mike asked if Alex had 

126
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,600
sent you a message last night. 

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,480
So we have the past tense, 

128
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,680
the simple past of send as a question, 

129
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,920
therefore it is do as an auxiliary verb of 
the 

130
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,140
question in the simple past and have our 

131
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,660
question in the indirect speech, our 

132
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,340
reporting verb in the simple past, the 

133
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,940
conjunction and therefore through the 

134
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,200
backshift of tenses. Send in the past 

135
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,760
perfect, so had sent. 

136
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,580
The will with the infinitive becomes 

137
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,580
would with the infinitive. For 

138
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,380
example, George. Anna will call you 

139
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,480
later. And in the Reported Speech. 

140
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,720
George said that Anna would call you 

141
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,080
later. 

142
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,900
How do pronouns change in the... 

143
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,040
indirect speech. First, 

144
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,680
let's look at the subject pronouns. I or 
you 

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,420
becomes he or she, depending on who 

146
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,320
is speaking. We or you becomes they. 

147
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,520
Here we have to pay attention to 

148
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,880
who, uh, who is speaking. Is you a 

149
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,680
single person or is you several 

150
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,720
people who form the subject. 

151
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,280
Accordingly, it then becomes he 

152
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,600
or she or they. For example, 

153
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,670
Paul, we went to the cinema. Paul 

154
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,730
said they had gone to the cinema. 

155
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,350
So we becomes they. 

156
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,520
Object changes me or you 

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,160
to him or her accordingly and us 

158
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,220
or you changes to them. Here too, 

159
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
as with the 

160
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,280
subject pronoun you, we have to pay 
attention to whether we are 

161
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,140

162
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,020
dealing with a singular or plural object. 
As an example, we have Mike. 

163
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,640
Mr. Miller doesn't like me. This means 
that 

164
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,760
in indirect speech 

165
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,080
, we know that me changes to him or her as 
the 

166
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,460
object. So, Mike said that Mr. Miller 

167
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,360
didn't like him, because it's about Mike 

168
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,680
, i.e. him, not her. 

169
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,560
Possessive pronouns change my or 

170
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,880
your to his or her accordingly. 

171
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,700
And and our or your to their. For 

172
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,800
example, My car broke on my way to 

173
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,280
the game. So in 

174
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,440
indirect speech , change to Vince said his 
car 

175
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,580
had broken on his way to the game. 

176
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,410
How do place and 

177
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,370
time references change when switching from 

178
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,820
direct to indirect speech? We 

179
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,660
use different vocabulary 

180
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,640
for direct and indirect speech. 

181
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,780
This means that the direct Now becomes 

182
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,000
Then or At 

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,260
that moment in indirect speech. Today 
becomes That day. 

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,540
Tonight becomes That night. 

185
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,580
Yesterday becomes The day before. 

186
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,000
Tomorrow becomes The next. Or the 

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,020
following day. This becomes that. 

188
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,040
And here becomes there. That looks 

189
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,700
like a lot of things 

190
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,920
that change at first. 

191
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,540

192
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,880

193
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,920
But once you get into it and take another 
look at these words, you 'll quickly get 
the hang of it. So, let's 

194
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,040
summarize. If we 

195
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,060

196
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,400
have the reporting verb in the present 
tense in indirect speech , the tense of 
the 

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,000
indirect speech remains unchanged. 

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
However, if the reporting verb is in the 

199
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,720
past tense, we apply the 

200
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,760
backshift of tenses. This means that 

201
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,320
simple present becomes simple past, 

202
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
present perfect becomes past perfect, 

203
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,020
simple past becomes past perfect, past 

204
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,280
perfect remains past perfect, be going 

205
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,280
to do something becomes was or were 

206
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,840
going to do something will under 

207
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,940
infinitive becomes would under 

208
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,520
infinitive. We also have to make sure 

209
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,980
that the 

210
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,500
pronouns, whether subject, object 

211
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,880
or possessive pronoun, and time and 

212
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,020
place specifications change accordingly. 
And that brings us to 

213
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,520
the end of 

214
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,760
today's webinar. 

215
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,620
Thank you for your attention 

216
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,680
and have a nice day.
