00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,370
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,850
statistics webinar . In this 

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,510
webinar, we will be looking at the 
statistics of 

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,470
stochastics. This means that we 

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,270
will first 

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,670
do a short review of the average, 

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,770
how to calculate it and I will 

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,750
also briefly anticipate that we 

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,690
will 

10
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,610
need it at some point during the webinar. 

11
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,550
Then we'll look at the importance 

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,070
of the expected value and how to 

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,170
calculate it. Then we'll move 

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,270
on to the variance and standard deviation. 

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,370
We'll do an 

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,590
example of this right away and 

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,130
we'll also look at the sigma rule at the 
very end 

18
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,940
. At the very end, there is 

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,840
a brief overview of the 

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,320
parameters for different 

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,580
distributions. This is a small 

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,840
table, 

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,780
you could say it' s like a little memo 
sheet , and I'll go into that 

24
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,240
again briefly. 

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,280
Well, let's start with the average 

26
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,480
. The average is what you 

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,640
actually calculate the climate, so 

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,700
for example with the grade point average, 

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,720
you also divide the sum of all grades 

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,900
by the number of 

31
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,300
grades distributed. This means that you 

32
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,480
first add up everything, i.e. x1 plus x2 

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
plus x3 and so on until xn, 

34
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,300
i.e. until you 

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,780
have added up all the values and divide by 
the total number. 

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,820
The advantage of this is that you get 

37
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,800
a very good overview of the 

38
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,480
values and can average them. 

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,700
In other words, you can say what 

40
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,320
the average grades are when it comes to 

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,420
grades, what the average 

42
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,660
performance was. The 

43
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,140
expected value is a value that 

44
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,260
, if you 

45
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,060
carry out a random experiment very often, 

46
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,120
should then be achieved in the long term 
and the 

47
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,780
expected value then becomes equal 

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,000
to the average. To achieve this, 

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
however, you really have to carry out the 
random experiment 

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,200
a corresponding number of times. That is 

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,280
very important. The expected value has 

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,600
this µ as a formula symbol and 

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,080
x1 times p of x1 applies. In other words, 
x1 

54
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,420
is the event and then it says 

55
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
what this event can do. We 

56
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,440
also have an exercise on this in a moment 

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,720
and I think that will make it very 

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,300
clear . So you always multiply 

59
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,820
the event by its 

60
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,040
probability. And you do this 

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,980
until 

62
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,940
you have no more events. Of course, all 

63
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,160
probabilities together must add up 

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,020
to 100%, otherwise 

65
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,980
there is an error. We have 

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,860

67
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,280
explained this using a small street game. 
It's about 

68
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,900
tossing a coin. And 

69
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,880
of course there are only two 
possibilities. 

70
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,280
Either you have heads or tails. The fact 
that 

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,680
the coin somehow 

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,660
remains on the edge 

73
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,220
is ruled out here. 

74
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,920
It doesn't actually correspond to reality 
either. In other words 

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,660
, we now know that we have 

76
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,380
defined X1 as winning 1 euro 

77
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,680
and X2 as losing 2 euros. 

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,200
The probability of a coin toss 

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
is that both sides are equally 

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,400
justified, i.e. 50% or 0 

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,700
.5. And so we arrive at X1 times P of 

82
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,080
X1 plus X2 times P of X equals 2. That 

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,040
is the approach for the 

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,760
expected value. And our X1 is now 

85
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
that we win 1 euro. That is, 

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
1 euro... times the probability, 

87
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,680
i.e. 0.5, plus the probability 

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,500
x2, which is that we 

89
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,380
lose 2 euros , therefore minus 2 euros, 
has 

90
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,670
0.5 minus 1 and that is then minus 0 

91
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,430
.5. This means that if we play the game 

92
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,170
for a very long time, we will 

93
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,450

94
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,030
have lost an average of 0.5 euros per 
round in the end. 

95
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,720
Next we come to the variance. 

96
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,720
Calculating the variance 

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
is much more difficult. In order to 

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,860
calculate the variance first, 

99
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,280
we need the average. 

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,540
This x across is the average. 

101
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,520
x1 to xn are values 

102
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,540
that we have. So, for 

103
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,360
example, if we 

104
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,120
are given a set of data and we are 
supposed to 

105
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,500

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,260
calculate the variance of this set of data 
, x1 to xn is the 

107
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,540
corresponding data. And you go 

108
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,900
ahead, calculate the difference from the 

109
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,440
first value to the average, 

110
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,220

111
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,120

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,780
square that and add the difference from 
the second value to the average to the 
square and so 

113
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,140
on. It always works like this. 

114
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,480
At the end, you also divide this by N, 

115
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,320
i.e. by the number of all 

116
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,660
values we have. This means that if 

117
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,600
we use five values here above, 

118
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,980
we have to divide by five at the end. 

119
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,460
The variance indicates the mean 

120
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,160
squared deviation at the end , i.e. from 
the 

121
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,460
mean value. Alternatively, if you 

122
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,060
know the expected value, you can 

123
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
also calculate that the variance of x is 

124
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,760
equal to the expected value of x minus 

125
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,080
µ squared. This is simply based 

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,180
on the assumption that the 

127
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,160
expected value will 

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,520

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
approach the mean if it is carried out 
sufficiently often. The 

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,820
standard deviation is nothing more 

131
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,420
than the square root of the variance. 
Therefore, 

132
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,160
the standard deviation, in 

133
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,960
contrast to the variance , also indicates 
the dispersion around 

134
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,640
the mean value. The variance 

135
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,460
simply indicates the squared deviation. 

136
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,500
And because we now take the square root, 

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
we only have the dispersion around 

138
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,040
the mean. This is why 

139
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,060
the standard deviation is used much more 
often 

140
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,920
than the variance. You may have already 

141
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,760
seen that we are about to 

142
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,680
look at the sigma rule and the sigma 

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,040
 rule is also based on the 

144
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,060
standard deviation. Well, let's move 

145
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,380
on to the application. That was 

146
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,180
perhaps quite a lot of theory, which 

147
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,540

148
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,420
is not always so clear due to the 
abundance of variables. 

149
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,720
Let's take the example of 

150
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,620
Paula observing 

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,680
how long it takes her to get to school in 
the morning for five days. On the 

152
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,060
first day she records 37 minutes, on the 

153
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,520
second day 30 minutes, on the third day 

154
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
45 minutes , on the fourth day 26 minutes 
and on the fifth 

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,720
day 40 minutes, i.e. we have five 

156
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,180
measured values. the first thing we do is 
calculate the 

157
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,300
average, i.e. we add 

158
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,320
up all the times, which means we 

159
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,060
consider how long she 

160
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,180
walked in these five days together, i.e. 
37 

161
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,540
to 30 45 26 plus plus 40. the whole thing 
is 

162
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,000
divided by 5, because we 

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
have 5 measured values, i.e. because 

164
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,040
she walked to school on 5 days 

165
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,200
. We then arrive at an 

166
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,780
average duration of 35.6 

167
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,920
minutes. Here you can also see the 

168
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,280
formula symbol, the x² is the 

169
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,700
average time. 

170
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,340
We need this average in a moment, 

171
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,340
as I said, it is important. Because 

172
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,960
next we want to 

173
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
determine the variance . We now have 5 
values. 

174
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,660

175
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,060
Our x1 is then 37, x2 

176
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,880
is 30, x3 is 45, x4 is 26 

177
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,080
and x5 is 40. And so we 

178
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,220
arrive at 37 minus 35.6 squared plus 30 

179
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,520
minus 35.6 squared. 

180
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,880
So please always square it, 

181
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,260
because you have to square this difference 
here 

182
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,620
. Otherwise only the 35... 

183
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,100
35.6 is squared. 

184
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
It took her 45 minutes on the third day , 
so 45 

185
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,400
minus 35.6 squared. On the fourth day, 

186
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
she needed 26 minutes, 

187
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,000
therefore 26 minus 35.6 squared. 

188
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,960
On the last day she needed 40 minutes, 

189
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,980
therefore 40 minus 35.6 

190
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,480
squared. Again, this is divided by n, 

191
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,560
i.e. divided by 5, the number 

192
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,140
of our measured values and you can enter 
this 

193
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,220
directly into the calculator 

194
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,740
or you can work 

195
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,000
out the values in brackets first , which 
you can choose 

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
. Just make sure that 

197
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,880
if you 

198
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,960
calculate the values in brackets first , 
the minus must 

199
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,420
be squared at the end , there is 

200
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,260
always a plus in between. Because 

201
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,900
we have minus 5.6 squared 

202
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,760
and the minus is then squared away 

203
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,720
or something positive comes out. 

204
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
We then end up with a 

205
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,520
variance of 46.64. 

206
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,180
As I have just said, 

207
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,320
the variance is not quite so common, 

208
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
so it is always calculated, but it 

209
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,960
is much better to work with the 

210
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,660
standard deviation. Therefore, the 

211
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,520
standard deviation was the square root 

212
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,320
of the variance. Consequently, 

213
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,640
we now take the square root of 46.64 to 

214
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,820

215
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
obtain the standard deviation . This is 
then 6.83. 

216
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,540
This means that 

217
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,940

218
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,620
if you want to determine the standard 
deviation , you can either 

219
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,640

220
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,020
enter the square root directly using the 
formula for the variance, which is 

221
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,540
also available, or you can first calculate 
the 

222
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,700
variance and then take 

223
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,900
the square root. 

224
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,400

225
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
If it is a binomial distribution and you 

226
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,400
have no measured values, you can 

227
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
also 

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,060
calculate the standard deviation using 
this formula. 

229
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,540
Of course, this is much more convenient 

230
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,760
because you only have to 

231
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,160
enter n and p here. Where n is the 

232
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,380
total number and p is the 

233
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,320
probability. In other words, n 

234
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,700
indicates how often you 

235
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,300
carry out the experiment and p is the 

236
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,640
probability of a single 

237
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,880
hit . 

238
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,380
If this standard deviation, which 

239
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,000
is calculated here, 

240
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,620
is greater than 3 , this binomial 
distribution can 

241
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,220
also 

242
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,300
be approximated to the normal 
distribution. However, as already 
mentioned, this is only possible 

243
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,280
if the standard deviation is greater 

244
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,440
than 3. 

245
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,270
Now we come to the sigma rule. The sigma 

246
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,450
 rule has the advantage that you can 

247
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,550
start with an interval right away, 

248
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,050
i.e. you 

249
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,990
first calculate the expected value and 
then 

250
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,010
the standard deviation. And then 

251
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,330
you calculate minus sigma once and 

252
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,230
plus sigma once. The interval 

253
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,010
that is spanned by this is then 

254
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,850
the so-called 1 sigma interval. And 

255
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,650
the 1 sigma interval has a 

256
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,850
probability of 68%. 

257
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,050
This means that if you carry out this 
experiment... 

258
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,830
moment, you will 

259
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,930

260
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,900
end up in this interval with a probability 
of 68% . 

261
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,020
Of course, you can also 

262
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,500
increase the interval accordingly. If the 
interval 

263
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,120
becomes larger, it is of course the 

264
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,440
logical consequence that the 

265
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,740
probability of 

266
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,620
landing in this interval also increases 

267
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,740
. For example, the 2 sigma 

268
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,840
interval, where the 

269
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,300
expected value µ minus 2 sigma is 

270
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,460
calculated and the other, the upper 

271
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,980
interval limit is then the 

272
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,860
expected value 

273
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,180
with a probability of 95.5%. 

274
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,980
Very characteristic values, 1.96 sigma 

275
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,360
interval are for example 95% 

276
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,500
and the 3 sigma interval here is 

277
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,280
almost never used, has even 99.7%. 

278
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,980
Now we come to the brief overview. 

279
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,700
We first see here with the 

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,960
Bernoulli distribution how to 

281
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,200
determine the variance, i.e. p times 1 
minus 

282
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,820
p. or the standard deviation, which 

283
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,140
is the square root of the variance, 

284
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,620
i.e. we simply take 

285
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,400
the square root here , which is then sigma 
is 

286
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,320
equal to the square root of P times 
bracket 

287
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,160
on 1 minus P bracket off. 

288
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,760
This is actually 

289
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,280
the same for the expected value , i.e. µ 
is n times P, which 

290
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,640
is easy to calculate and 

291
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,800
very important for hypergeometric 

292
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
distributions or 

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,740
hypergeometric distributions in general , 
which are 

294
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,380
completely different from 

295
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,320
binomial distributions. With 

296
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,280
hypergeometric distributions 

297
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,820
, the probability p or 

298
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,500
the number of elements is not 

299
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,560
constant. This is why 

300
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,440
the formulas are so complex. 

301
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,240
In the binomial distribution, 

302
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,500
as already mentioned, we have n times p 

303
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,720
times 1 minus p for the variance and 

304
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,300
7 times is equal to n 

305
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,740
times p for the standard deviation . p 
times 1 minus p. This formula 

306
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,600
here is the one that 

307
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,980
is used most often in the 

308
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,620
epidemic distribution. That brings us to 

309
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,960
the end of the webinar. I 

310
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,280
hope you enjoyed the 

311
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,620
webinar. 

312
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,580
In any case, thank you very much for your 

313
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,260
attention.
