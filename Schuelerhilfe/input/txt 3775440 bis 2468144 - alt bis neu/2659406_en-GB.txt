00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,200
Schülerhilfe webinar. Let's start with a 

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,140
quick technology check. Can you hear me 

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,660
well? 

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,800
If so, write a short 

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,780
message in the chat. 

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,960
Bene. Good. So, 

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,720
today we're going to look at the formation 
and 

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,560
declension of nouns in 

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,940
the Latin language. This means that we 

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,500
will first 

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,820
look at the definition of declension and 

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,200
then look at the individual 

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,420
declensions... declension classes 

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,560
. We will look at the 

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,260
A, the O, the consonantal, 

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,980
the U and the E declension and 

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,440
then conclude our webinar 

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,060
by looking at an overview of the 

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,000
different genera, i.e. the 

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,820
individual genders of the 

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,860
different declensions 

23
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,040
as a rule. Let's start with the 

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,340
definition of declension, i.e. the 

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,180
question, what does declination mean 

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,780
? We 

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,640
usually know declension in the context of 
nouns. 

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,200
This means that nouns are 

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,040
declined. We also know this under 

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,340
the term inflected. They 

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,980
are inflected. A declension 

32
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,440
is a so-called inflection, i.e. the 

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,140
adaptation of a noun 

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,700
. 

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,600
In other words , if we remember, 

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,100
subjects, objects or other 

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,860
nouns are nouns. 

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,720
Nouns and they are given a 

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,660
declension. This means 

40
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,860
that they are adapted to a case and, in 
addition to the 

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,940
case, they are also given a number 

42
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,340
and a gender. In other words, a number 

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,880
and a gender. In other words, we 

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,500
adapt a noun, a substance, 

45
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
a noun to a situation, 

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,280
namely the case, to a number, 

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
singular or plural and then a 

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,460
gender. The declension always forms 

49
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,600
according to all three criteria. This is 
called 

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
inflection. This means 

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,180
that all three criteria are always 

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,020
taken into account. This means that case, 

53
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,160
number and gender are always 

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,960
connected. Nouns 

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,660
are assigned to different 

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,700
declension classes. This 

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,980
means that it is important, as 

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,760
we know it from verbs, with the 

59
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,240
three verb stems: the present, the 

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,640
perfect and the participle stem, that 

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,980
we always 

62
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,540

63
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,100
learn the nominative and also the genitive 
singular for nouns . This is 

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,840
important because some forms 

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,460
occur more than once. This means that we 

66
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,980
can 

67
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,720
always recognize which form we are dealing 
with based on the genitive singular 

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,780
. With the nominative 

69
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,060
case, it is generally not completely 
definable. 

70
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,480
For example, when we talk about the U 

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
 declension or the U 

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,540
 declension, we 

73
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,240
don't know in between whether it is 

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,840
a nominative or 

75
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,340
an accusative. The sixth case, that 

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,180
is, when we talk about cases, 

77
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,140
we know four from the German 

78
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,680
nominative, genitive, dative and 

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,580
accusative. In Latin, there is 

80
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,440
also the adverbial 

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,200
case, the adverbial case, which is the 
applicative 

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,420
, and the sixth case, the vocative . 

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,300
This is used as a form of address and 

84
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,600
often or usually resembles the nominative. 

85
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,700
Declining therefore means adapting 

86
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,180
to the following criteria. The case, 

87
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,520
nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, 

88
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,260
applicative or vocative. One of these 

89
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,080
will occur, the number, singular 

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,300
or plural, that is either or or 

91
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,320
genus, that is and the gender, 

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,460
that is either masculine or 

93
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,040
feminine or neuter. These three 

94
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,000
, or one point of each of the three, are 

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,660
selected and then 

96
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,580
ultimately form the inflection, i.e. 

97
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,700
the inflection, the declension of a 

98
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,550
noun. Any 

99
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,830
questions so far ? 

100
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,900
Wonderful. The structure and 

101
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,980
declension order 

102
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,880
of the A-declension. The A declension 

103
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,220
is mostly 

104
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
used for nouns with feminine genders. That 

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,060
is, all of these, or most of them, 

106
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,800
there are of course always a few 

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,220
deviations, but most 

108
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,220
nouns 

109
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,540
that are in the A declension are also 
feminine. That is, 

110
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,400
with a few exceptions, such as 

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,660
pirata or agricola, which 

112
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,360
mean the farmer or the pirate, which 

113
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,300
is masculine , most nouns are 

114
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,980
feminine . Let's take the 

115
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,620
example of via. This means that the 

116
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,340
declension follows the following 

117
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,540
principle. We have the word stem, 

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,500
wie, and then add the 

119
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,020
declension ending. This means that the 

120
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,420
different case forms, and 

121
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,200
the case forms 

122
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,360
also contain the number and the 

123
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,500
gender. This means, 

124
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,300
for example, that if 

125
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,220
we imagine it this way, we have 

126
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,460
the number and the case within 

127
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,840
the declension ending and 

128
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,220
then we understand 

129
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,500
the gender by 

130
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,400

131
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,780
knowing the basic principles of the 
individual declensions. This means that if 

132
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,140
we know, for example, that the A 

133
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,420
 declension is mostly feminine and 

134
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,220
we have a noun 

135
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,280
, such as pirate, which 

136
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,540
is not feminine at all , we can recognize 
from the 

137
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,120
adjective, which always follows the 

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,240
basic principle that, for 

139
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,960
example, an A declension 

140
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,340
is always feminine and that the O 

141
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,480
 declension is masculine and the 

142
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,680
neuter is the consonantal 

143
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,500
declension, then we can 

144
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,700
recognize from the adjective which gender 

145
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,300
the noun has. Basically 

146
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,380
, however, it is the case 

147
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,120
that the adjective and the 

148
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,660
noun have the same gender, i.e. 

149
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,340
the same declension ending 

150
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,140
. Let's 

151
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,980
take a look at the mostly feminine 

152
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,260
declension of A. That is, we, 

153
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,400
we, we, we, we, we. In the plural 

154
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,720
, we, weum, wes, so wes, wes 

155
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,440
, wes. We. We realize that there are 

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,940
many, as I 

157
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,060
mentioned at the beginning , many forms 
that 

158
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,700
are congruent. 

159
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,700
For example, we take the dative and the 
nominative 

160
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,180
, or the dative and the 

161
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,600
plural of the applicative . These things 
need to be 

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,120
taken into account and memorized. 

163
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
For example, if we know 

164
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,400
that we always 

165
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,860
have a genitive plural with a rum form, 
i.e. A-rum form, 

166
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
we can quickly and easily 

167
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,560
recognize which case we are 

168
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,720
dealing with. In the case of the dative 
and 

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
the numerative, i.e. the dative 

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,700
singular and the numerative plural 

171
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,380
, we have to 

172
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,260
recognize from the context of the sentence 

173
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,180
whether it is actually the dative or 

174
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,460
the nominative. A brief digression. 

175
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,140
We usually recognize the nominative 

176
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,220
by the fact that the predicate, in this 

177
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,100
case, if we had we now, 

178
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,580
we would have to decide whether it is 

179
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,680
genitive, dative or plural. So 

180
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,940
nominative, plural. So genitive, 

181
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,740
singular, dative, singular or 

182
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,640
nominative, plural. we would have to use 

183
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,760
the predicate to check whether 

184
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,180
a nominative would be possible here. 

185
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,140
This means that the predicate would also 
have to 

186
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,940
be plural for the nominative 

187
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,640
to work. If not, 

188
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,360
we have to decide 

189
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,800
whether it is a genitive or a 

190
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,980
dative. We can also 

191
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,800
make this dependent on the predicate 

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,360
, for example if we have a predicate 

193
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,520
that needs a dative. Also, if, 

194
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,040
for example, wilkon-sulere 

195
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,620
can be formed with a dative 

196
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,980
, there is a high probability that 

197
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,640
we are dealing with the dative here. 

198
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,420
This means that we have to 

199
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,120
check which 

200
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,960
case it is and whether it 

201
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,560
really is this case using the other parts 
of the sentence. 

202
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,800
Right, let's move on to the 

203
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,500
original declension. The odeclension 

204
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,600
is used for most nouns with a 

205
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,880
masculine or neuter gender. 

206
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,660
The nouns end in "-us", 

207
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,480
i.e. in the nominative case. This 

208
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,700

209
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,700
means that nominatives ending in "-us" are 
also masculine in 

210
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,940
most cases. The vocative 

211
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,300
is formed in the singular with "-e". These 
are the 

212
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,160
basic principles for the 

213
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,640
declension. So we have 

214
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,740
established that there are both 

215
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,600
masculine and neuter 

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,900
 nouns 

217
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,760
that are formed with the original 
declension 

218
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,240
. We must then 

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,020
note that the nouns 

220
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,440

221
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,860
that have a primary S-handling in the 
nominative case 

222
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,500
are usually or always masculine and do not 

223
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,760
have a neuter gender. We can see this here 
with 

224
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,680
the example of advocatus. 

225
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,080
Advocatus, Advocati, Advocato, 

226
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,120
Advocatum, Advocato, Advocate. 

227
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,440
Advocati, Advocatorum, Advocatis 

228
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,660
, Advocatos, Advocatis, Advocati. We 

229
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,700
quickly realize that we 

230
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,680
also 

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,980
have the genitive plural with a rum ending 
here. 

232
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,360
We have A-rum in the O-declension and 

233
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
O-rum in the O-declension. So we can see 

234
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,760
that for the A and O 

235
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,620
 declensions 

236
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,660
, we have a rum in the genitive plural in 
most cases . 

237
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,580
This makes it easier for us to 

238
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,440
come up with easy mnemonic devices to help 
us 

239
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,480

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,420

241
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,560
classify the nouns in the sentence more 
quickly in the correct case. We also 

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,860
notice that we have the 

243
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,000
genitive singular and nominative plural 

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,700
problem here again. 

245
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,100
The following method applies here too. We 

246
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,300
also note that vocatis and 

247
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,080
vocatis, i.e. dative and appellative 

248
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,680
plural, 

249
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,800
are the same with the ending of the A 
declension. We also have 

250
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,260
the IS ending again. This is also 

251
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,620
a characteristic of these two 

252
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,620
declensions. So if 

253
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,840
we have an IS ending and we 

254
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,500
are dealing with the A or O declension 

255
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,560
, we can 

256
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,080
always conclude that we 

257
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
have either or. 

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
Of course, we also have to check this 
again within the 

259
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,920
sentence. Ablatives 

260
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,200
, for example, are usually in the context 
of 

261
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,760
adverbials. For example, 

262
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,980
adlativus locus or temporis and 

263
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,360
others. The dative tends to be used as a 

264
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,400
direct or indirect object in the 

265
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,300
sentence. Okay, now we come to the 

266
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,420
declension with a special ending. 

267
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,980
This means that some of these nouns 

268
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,160
in the original declension have no US 

269
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,600
ending at all , i.e. not only. As I said, 
it' 

270
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,140
s important that we know that the US 

271
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,760
 ending is 

272
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,200
masculine  in most cases. There are also 

273
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,720
neuter nouns, which we'll look at 

274
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,000
in a moment. But there are also 

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,100
nouns 

276
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,460
that have no US ending at all in the 
nominative singular. 

277
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,380
This means, for example, that 

278
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,500
Puer, the boy, is 

279
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,220
formed without US , but follows the 

280
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,200
same declension order. 

281
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,220
This means that we can only 

282
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,300

283
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,600
recognize that this is 

284
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,160
the O-declension masculine with the help 
of the genitive singular, as mentioned at 
the beginning 

285
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,140
. Okay, we also see 

286
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,660
IS, IS or the O again . Now let's move on 
to 

287
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,460
the O-declension with gender. 

288
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,780
Neuter. Here it is the case that 

289
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,740
nominatives, i.e. the nominative 

290
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,460
singular on um, are neuter. This 

291
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,520
means that we can determine us 

292
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,980
masculine, um neuter. Now, 

293
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,760
however, we have to be careful, there is 

294
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,360
of course also 

295
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,080
the um in the original masculine 
declaration , i.e. the um ending, such 

296
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,840
as puero. 

297
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,680
We must not confuse this with the 
nominative of the 

298
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,900
neutra. O declension. 

299
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,320
We can recognize this by the fact that 

300
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,100
the plural is formed with A. 

301
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,720
This means that in the O-declension with 

302
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,740
neuter gender, as we 

303
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,700
can see here in the example of templum 

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,360
, the nominative plural and the 

305
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,160
accusative plural end with A 

306
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,780
and not 

307
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,940
with I or OS as we know it from the 
others. 

308
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,660
Okay, that's enough to say. Are there 

309
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,540
any questions so far? 

310
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,220
Very good. Now let's move on to the 

311
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,200
consonantal declension. So that 

312
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,120
would be important 

313
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,620
to say about the original declension. 

314
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,660
So we can see that there is the US ending 
with 

315
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,360
masculine, i.e. the ending of 

316
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,280
masculines that don't have a US ending 

317
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,100
but a different one, 

318
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,580
such as er or nur er and the 

319
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,980
neuter, which 

320
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,660
has um as a special feature in the 
nominative and the a in the plural, 

321
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,060
both in the nominative and 

322
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,880
the accusative. Now we come to the 

323
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,140
consonantal declension. 

324
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,500
Nouns in the consonantal 

325
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,900
declension have two 

326
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,100
orders of declension. Most 

327
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,960
nouns follow the principle of the 

328
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,720
first declension. 

329
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,420
I will now 

330
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,560
introduce the order of declension . The 
nominative 

331
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
singular has no additional 

332
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,560
case ending. This means that it remains 

333
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,900
as it is. It is basically 

334
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,120
just the nucleus. We can see it here in 

335
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,820
the example of senator. Senator remains 

336
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,160
senator. Senatoris, Senatori, 

337
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,420
Senatorim, Senatori, Senator. 

338
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,140
Note that the vocative also remains 
without a 

339
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,320
declension ending. Then Senatores, 

340
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,360
Senatorum, Senatoribus, Senatores 

341
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,640
, Senatoribus, Senatores. Here, too, 

342
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,560
we have the same 

343
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,600
change in the vocative as the nominative. 
If we 

344
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,540
imagine this or if 

345
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,980
we 

346
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,280

347
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,600
want to point out the special features of 
this declension change , we can see that 
the 

348
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,960
nominative and accusative plural 

349
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,040
are the same. We have 

350
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,800
the E in the accusative singular here , 
but we also have an 

351
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
M again and we also have an um. Not an 

352
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,380
Orum, not an Arum, but only an 

353
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Um . If we look closely, 

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,700
we see that the R and 

355
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,600
in this case also the O, i.e. the 

356
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,840
orum, are already contained in the word. 

357
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,940
As a special feature, 

358
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,560
the dative and the applative 

359
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,880
are again the same in the plural. the 
ending. 

360
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,580
However, some nouns also follow 

361
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,020
the second declension order. These 

362
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,900
have the IUM in the 

363
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,040
plural as a special feature. Many of their 
kind are 

364
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,940
also the same in the nominative and 
genitive 

365
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,040
singular, such as KIVES. It is 

366
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,820
also masculine, so there is no 

367
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,760
difference between the 

368
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,180
genera, no 

369
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,120
difference between the genders, but 

370
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,840
the simple declension. and 

371
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,420
we can recognize the difference by the 
fact 

372
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,240
that it is called Kivis Kivis 

373
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
and then we automatically know that it 

374
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,660
is called Kivium in the genitive plural. 

375
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,160
This means that here we have an 

376
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,500
additional I and we realize that 

377
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,580
we 

378
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,640
have neither an O nor an R, i.e. no rum, 
but an Ium 

379
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,060
. The rest of the formulas remain the 

380
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,420
same . 

381
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,660
If we now 

382
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,500
look at the consonantal declension with 
genus neuter 

383
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,020
, we see that it 

384
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,580

385
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,400
is similar to the original definition in 
its special features. Here we have 

386
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,460
the nominative and accusative plural with 
an A 

387
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,940
 ending. No I in the genitive 

388
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,140
plural, but we do have corpus 

389
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,420
corporis. Yes, we know this 

390
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,560
from the fact that the form changes. 

391
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,600
This means that we have corpus here and we 

392
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
have to 

393
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,140
add an OR to the word stem 

394
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,480
and then 

395
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,220
add the declension ending and this remains 

396
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,940
the same for the rest of the declension 
order, 

397
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,780
except for the vocative, which, as 

398
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,340
already mentioned, 

399
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,880
is the same in most cases in the 
nominative. And so 

400
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,580
we see again that 

401
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,540
we don't need an ion in the genitive , 
because 

402
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,600
here we have the orm again, as we 

403
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,720
know it from the original declension, and 

404
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,360
here we have the OR part as the word stem 
and 

405
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,480
the UM attached. Okay, 

406
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,900
of course we have to bear in mind that the 

407
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,140
genitive 

408
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,920
is formative , as already explained. Okay, 
some nouns 

409
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,880
change several forms and take on 

410
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,340
all the peculiarities of the other. 

411
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,280
Declension. 

412
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,640
Basically , this means 

413
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,040
that we can see the maximum of the 
consonantal declension 

414
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,240
here in the example of mare, mares. 

415
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,440
Here we see that we have 

416
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,300
the nominative again unchanged, 

417
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,500
i.e. without declension order, but 

418
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,980
this time with Re, i.e. Mare. Then we have 

419
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,680
Mares, Mare, Mare, Marie in the 

420
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,880
applicative, which is important, so 

421
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,860
the same here, then Mare. So, 

422
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,060
we also notice that we 

423
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,900
have Maria here. So we have not only 

424
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,080
added the A, but also an I and an 

425
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,960
Ium, as we already 

426
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
knew earlier. We have seen this here in 
the 

427
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,040
example of Kivium. And the 

428
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,900
nominative and the accusative 

429
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,260
are the same, as we 

430
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,560
know from the consonantal. But with the 

431
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,940
special feature that we don't just 

432
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,340
have an A, but an Ia. And this 

433
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,100
is also followed. Also in the 

434
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,020
vocative. Attention! Some nouns 

435
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,980
with a consonantal 

436
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,320
declension order are also femina. 

437
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,100
For example, Regio Regiones, 

438
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,900
Plebs Plebis or Vox Vocis. They have 

439
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,380
the feminine gender. 

440
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,920
Any questions so far? 

441
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:52,200
Great! Now let's move on to the U 

442
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,460
 declension. Most nouns 

443
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,420
in the U declension are masculine. 

444
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,720
There are some exceptions to the 

445
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,220
distribution of genders, but let's 

446
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,700

447
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
take a look at the basic example here. We 
can see it here 

448
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,940
with the example of case, masculine 

449
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,280
case. Kasus, kasus, kasui, kasum 

450
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,680
, kasu, kasus. Kasus, kasuum, kasibus, 

451
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,800
kasus, kasibus, kasus. Here too, 

452
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,380
Observation , the OS is not 

453
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,800
the identifying word for the original 
declaration. we 

454
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,120
remember that the genitive 

455
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,300
is also the same. That is, as soon as the 
genitive 

456
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,360
is with an Us ending, 

457
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,040
we know it is the U-declension and 

458
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,100
then a few things take effect. 

459
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,840
We realize that 

460
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,540
all 

461
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,500
forms except for the dative and the 
ablative plural are formed with a U. 

462
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,880
This means that, unlike in the U 

463
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
 declension, we 

464
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,700
often have an I, for example. Here we have 
the U 

465
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,040
We therefore establish case, i.e. 

466
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,380
case, case. And we have a 

467
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,260
double 

468
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,720
U in the genitive plural case. The 
nominative and the accusative 

469
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,240
are the same, as we 

470
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,980
know from the consonantal. Both 

471
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,640
formed with US. And we have another 

472
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,260
peculiarity. We cannot clearly 

473
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,320
differentiate whether it is singular or 

474
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,020
plural. We can 

475
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,800

476
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,560
explain this again from the context of the 
sentence. Some nouns can 

477
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,760

478
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,540
take on the ending of the O declension , 
as we 

479
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,620
know from domus, domus, for example, is 
feminine 

480
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,000
and can also 

481
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,260
be formed with domus in the accusative 
plural . Yes, so it 

482
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,760
doesn't always have to 

483
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,100
be domus , but can also 

484
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,220
contain the OS. So much for the 
O-declension. 

485
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,900
The E declension is mostly 

486
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,680
feminine, the nominative and accusative 

487
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,040
endings are the same in the consonantal 

488
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,560
declension of masculines. So 

489
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,880
here we have ES endings, ES endings 

490
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
and we have, as we 

491
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
also 

492
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,900
want to sing here in the nominative, for 
example, Res, Re, Re, Rem, 

493
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,840
ja, Re, Res, Re, Rum, here 

494
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,700
again the Rum, this time only with E, 

495
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,520
for the E declension, so like 

496
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,480
the U declension it is also very E-heavy. 

497
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,420
Here we don't have a single form 

498
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,420
that is not formed with E. 

499
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,220
We already know the rebus from ribus, 

500
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,200
here in the E-declension with rebus. 

501
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,660
I've already mentioned res and res, 

502
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,480
as well as the dative and the applative. 

503
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,960
Okay, there are also 

504
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,680
exceptions to the E declension , such as 

505
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,360
Dies or Diei is masculine. The day 

506
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,500
is masculine. Otherwise, in 

507
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,400
most cases the E declension is 

508
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,260
feminine. Any questions so far? 

509
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,470
Great. Now let's move on to the 

510
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,950
overview of the general. The form ending 

511
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,030
and the corresponding gender. 

512
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,790
For example, we see that or we' 

513
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,090
ve established that we 

514
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,610
have exceptions and it's 

515
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,130
still difficult and it's 

516
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,010
difficult to recognize and 

517
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,310
characterize a pattern. However, there are 

518
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,830
some universal patterns that 

519
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,690
we can remember. 

520
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,310
For example , if we 

521
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,070
have an OR or an ES with genitive ITIS, 
then we have 

522
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,390
the masculine gender, 

523
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,810
such as Senator or Miles. With 

524
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,830
the endings O, AS, ES or IS, 

525
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,110
we usually have feminines as the gender, 
such 

526
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,150
as Optio Clamatas, 

527
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,790
sorry, Clamati Satia 

528
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,310
clarmitas, sorry, as 

529
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,210
damage and misfortune, or nubes or 

530
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,470
navis, the cloud or the ship, 

531
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,670
feminine, or, as I forgot 

532
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,370
to say, the S or the X for 

533
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,450
plebs and vox, which we have just 

534
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,910
seen as an example. The US 

535
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,050
 ending and the EN ending are 

536
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,810
usually 

537
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,730
responsible for the neuter gender. 
Attention, in the O 

538
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,530
 declension we have said, 

539
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,930
for example, we  have Servus as the US 

540
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,710
 ending. However, this is not 

541
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,630
formative. This changes, 

542
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,190
so we can only 

543
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,090
see the US ending as a neuter, such as 

544
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,410
corpus or opus. These are neutre. 

545
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,730
Neuter forms and the en ending, 

546
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,530
such as nouns in the nominative case. 

547
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,350
Okay, that's a brief 

548
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,330
overview of the 

549
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,910
declension classes. 

550
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,930
If there are no more questions 

551
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,130
, I hope that this webinar 

552
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,710
has helped you and I

554
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,770
attention. You can still 

555
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,730

556
