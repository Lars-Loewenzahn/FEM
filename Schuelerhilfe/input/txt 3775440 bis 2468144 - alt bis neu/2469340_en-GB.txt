Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,930
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,050
at Schülerhilfe. 

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,070
Today I 'm happy to 

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,230

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,570
explain the topic of valence line 
formulas, single and multiple bonds to 
you. In addition to this video, 

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,710
you can also 

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,390
 find a wiki 

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,230
on this topic in our online learning 
center, where 

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,490
the most important terms and 

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,410
basics are explained. As a 

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,470
reminder, valence electrons are the 

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,430
outer electrons of an atom, which are 

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,410
located in the outermost shell and 

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,770

16
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,410
are involved in bonds between atoms . In 
the 

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,070
main group elements, the 

18
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,910
main group number, i.e. the 

19
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,970
columns from 1 to 8, corresponds to the 
number of 

20
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,850
valence electrons. These 

21
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,470
valence electrons can be 

22
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,530
easily 

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,490
represented using the valence-dash line 
notation . 

24
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,470
A dot symbolizes one electron 

25
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,190
and a dash two electrons, which are 

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,850
to be regarded as an electron pair. 

27
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,830
Now all atoms strive for a 

28
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,210
completely filled outer shell, the 

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,230
so-called noble gas configuration. To 

30
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,870
achieve this goal, 

31
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,310

32
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,130
electron pair bonds can be 

33
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,770
formed between the bonding partners in 
addition to ion formation. 

34
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,210
In an electron pair bond, 

35
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,770
the bonding partners 

36
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,770
share electron pairs in order to 

37
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,010

38
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,410

39
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,870
carry the full number of electrons in the 
outer shell , i.e. usually 8. Questions. 

40
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,190
When atoms of the same element join 
together , they form 

41
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,910
as many electron pair bonds 

42
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,310
between each other as each atom 

43
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,390

44
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,750
lacks valence electrons to achieve the 
noble gas configuration. 

45
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,550

46
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,670

47
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,430
There is a 

48
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,610
single bond between the chlorine atoms of 
the biatomic molecule , i.e. a chlorine 
molecule consisting of two atoms . This is 

49
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,550

50
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,630

51
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,990

52
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,210
represented in the valence line notation 
by a line, which stands for the electron 
pair bond. Through the bond, 

53
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,730
both atoms reach the 

54
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,830
noble gas configuration, in this case the 

55
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,970
electron configuration of argon. 

56
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,310

57
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,250
 There is a so-called 

58
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,290
double bond between the oxygen atoms of 
the O2 molecule . This gives 

59
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,130
oxygen the 

60
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,270
electron configuration of neon 

61
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,550
, just like nitrogen, where 

62
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,750

63
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,550
 a triple bond 

64
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,570
is formed between the nitrogen atoms of 
the N2 molecule . 

65
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,250

66
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,130
However, more than a triple bond is not 
possible between two atoms. 

67
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,470

68
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,030

69
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,750

70
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,570

71
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,710
Valence line formulas can also be easily 
established for bonds between atoms of 
different elements due to their electron 
configuration . 

72
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,270
When hydrogen and 

73
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,690
oxygen are combined , H2O is formed 
because 

74
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,890
oxygen needs two 

75
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,790
electron pair bonds to 

76
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,450
fill up to 8 outer electrons. A 

77
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,030
hydrogen atom can only 

78
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,910
form one electron bond, as 

79
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,990
each atom only has one electron. 

80
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,090
For this reason, an 

81
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,530
oxygen atom binds two hydrogen atoms. 

82
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,890
Oxygen reaches the configuration 

83
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,210
of neon and hydrogen that of 

84
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,970
helium. If we combine carbon and 

85
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,010
oxygen to form CO2, we see that 

86
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,650
the carbon atoms 

87
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,150

88
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,790
must each form two double bonds with the 
oxygen atoms. In the case of 

89
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,950
carbon, which as an atom 

90
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,050

91
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,330
had one bar and two dots in the valence 
bar notation 

92
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,130
, the bar is transformed into two 

93
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,690
dots for bonding , as carbon 

94
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,730
must have four bonds in order 

95
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,810
to achieve the noble gas configuration 

96
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,330
. This means that carbon atoms 

97
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,510
can 

98
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,870
bind between two and four atoms , 
depending on which bond, 

99
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,010
single or multiple, you 

100
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,570
form with the bonding partners. For 

101
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,410
a given molecular formula, 

102
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,190
the valence bar notation helps to 

103
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,950

104
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,210
establish the structural formula , taking 
into account the octet rule . The 

105
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,410
octet rule states that the atoms of 

106
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,170
all elements with the exception of 

107
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,170
hydrogen and helium 

108
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,910

109
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,010

110
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,030
strive for 8 electrons in their outer 
shell , the Latin word for this is octo . 
Let's take a look at this using 

111
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,810
a few examples. Ethane with 

112
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,610
the molecular formula C2H6 can only 

113
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,090
have the following structure. 

114
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,670
Four 

115
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,910
single bonds emanate from each carbon atom 
. There are four 

116
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,670
lines attached to each C. Six of these 

117
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,050
single bonds go to the 

118
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,050
hydrogen atoms. In ethene with the 

119
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,670
formula C2H4 

120
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,410
, there is a double bond between the 
carbon atoms 

121
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,950
so that they 

122
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,890
reach the noble gas configuration. 

123
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,930
Ethyne with C2H2 even has a 

124
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,450
triple bond between the 

125
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,510
carbon atoms. Formic acid with 

126
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,310
the molecular formula CH2O2 or CHOOH 

127
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,910
looks like this. The four-bond 

128
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,530
carbon has a single bond to 

129
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,870
one hydrogen and one 

130
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,630
oxygen, which 

131
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,450

132
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,930
shares a second electron pair bond with 
the second hydrogen atom, as well as a 

133
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,590
double bond to the second 

134
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,430
oxygen atom. In this way, all 

135
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,570
atoms achieve the noble gas configuration. 
In 

136
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,050
formaldehyde with the formula CH2O 

137
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,850
, the carbon atom forms single bonds 

138
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,830
to the two hydrogen atoms 

139
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,750
and a double bond to 

140
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,130
oxygen. Acetonitrile with the 

141
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,610
sum formula CH3CN shows a 

142
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,270
triple bond between nitrogen 

143
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,970
and one carbon atom. The other 

144
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,910
carbon atom has four 

145
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,710
single bonds, three to the 

146
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,050
hydrogen atoms and one to the CN 

147
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,850
 group. Thank you for your 

148
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,710
attention. I hope this 

149
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,350
video has 

150
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,090

151
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,130
contributed to your understanding of the 
topic of valence bond formulas . In order 
to 

152
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,010
deepen the content even more, 

153
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,590
 there are of course other 

154
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,250
offers available to you in the Online 
Learning Center. For example, 

155
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,930
we have interactive tasks, 

156
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,770
worksheets and webinars in which 

157
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,210
our tutors 

158
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,350

159
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,350
explain various topics in more detail.
