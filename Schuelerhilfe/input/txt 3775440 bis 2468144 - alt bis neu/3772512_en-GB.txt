00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,280
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,040
Trigonometry. In 

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,640
this webinar , we will look at 
trigonometric 

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,520
functions and the sine and cosine 

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,300
theorems. 

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,900
We will also look at when 

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,560
something is used and why we 

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,020

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,880
need the sine and cosine theorems . 

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,160
We will also 

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,040
convey this knowledge using these three 
examples , which we will then of course 

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,760
work on together and 

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,180

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,740
apply what we have already learned and 

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,300
explain again accordingly . Let's start 

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,060
with the three 

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,580
trigonometric 

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,020
functions commonly used in school. But 
before we do that 

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,980
, let's first look at what 

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,900
trigonometric functions are. 

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,240
In fact, trigonometric functions 

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,360
are actually a very practical 

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,860
thing, because they represent 

24
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,700

25
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,520
or show relationships in a right-angled 
triangle . Very importantly, this 

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,200
only applies in a right-angled triangle. 

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,800
We can therefore only 

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,120

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,320
use them in right-angled triangles . This 
means that if 

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,060
there is no right-angled triangle 

31
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,480
, we unfortunately cannot 

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,400
use them. A right angle in 

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,780
a triangle is always marked by such a 

34
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,780
point, 

35
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,420
i.e. it is a 90-degree angle, which means 

36
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,780
that there is a right angle 

37
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,300
and then we can also 

38
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,720

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,360
use the trigonometric functions 
accordingly. And if we are 

40
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,700

41
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,400

42
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,500

43
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,760

44
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,880
working with the sine, cosine or tangent , 
which are the three trigonometric 
functions used at school , then we are 
also talking about 

45
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,180
cathets and hypotenuses or, more precisely 

46
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,180
, the ante- and anticathets 

47
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,200
and a hypotenuse. I would always 

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,820
advise that you look at the 

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,560
hypotenuse first , because 

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
you can always 

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,600
get a good overview from there. This is 
very important. The 

52
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,920
hypotenuse is really always the 

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
longest side of the triangle and is 

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,740
opposite the right angle. 

55
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
This means that if this is our 

56
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,420
right angle, then this is 

57
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,780
the hypotenuse. I think you can 

58
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,100
also see that side C is 

59
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,380
the longest side in this triangle and it 
is 

60
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,180
also the hypotenuse. 

61
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,500
Unfortunately, things get 

62
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,960
a bit more complex with the anchoring 
catheter and the counter-catheter . So if 
this is 

63
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,860
the hypotenuse, A and B are 

64
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,780
catheters. Which of the two 

65
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,680

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,420
is the anterior and which of the two is 
the posterior catheter must then 

67
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,120
be clarified accordingly using 

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
the angle. And that's what we' 

69
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,520
re going to look at now. Because the 
anathema 

70
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,440
is always the cathetus of the angle 

71
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,940
. We still have the triangle 

72
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,020
from before, which means that C is still 

73
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,780
our hypotenuse. And here we have 

74
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,040
beta in the land angle. And that is 

75
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
a cathetus here, so A and B are 

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,820
also a cathetus. And for beta 

77
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,300
, A is the anathema, because 

78
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,120
that's the cathetus of the angle 

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
. And B is 

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,860
the opposite cathetus, i.e. the cathetus 

81
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,240
opposite the angle. The 

82
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,920
whole thing changes, of course, as soon as 

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,680
we look at the alpha angle. If 

84
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,280
we look at the angle alpha 

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,200
, C is of course still the hypotenuse. 

86
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,080
But then side B is the on-cathetus 

87
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,260
 and side A is the 

88
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,020
off-cathetus. This is very important. So 

89
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,080
the on-cathetus is always the cathetus 

90
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,660
that is at the angle, and the off-cathetus 

91
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,040
is the cathetus that 

92
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,100
is opposite the angle. Please 

93
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,000
check this 

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,360
carefully every time you are given a 
different angle , because if you 

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,340

96
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,940
have to calculate a triangle like this, 
you 

97
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,300
sometimes calculate with the angle beta. 
And 

98
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,160
sometimes with the angle alpha. And 

99
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,820
then, of course, the 

100
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,100
anchor and opposite cathets also change. 
Because, as 

101
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,140
I said, B is the anchor cathetus of alpha 

102
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,740
and A is the anchor cathetus of beta. 

103
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,640
So please pay attention here. Well, let' 

104
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,340
s now move on to what this is 

105
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,720
all about. So, we see that 

106
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,980
the sine of an angle is always 

107
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,860
a fraction. So the sine, for 

108
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,880
example, is the opposite cathetus 

109
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,640
divided by the hypotenuse that 

110
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
means if we 

111
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,080
look at the angle alpha against the 
cathetus here 

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,780
alpha is our hypotenuse 

113
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,340
because here is the right angle that 

114
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,680
means this is the an-cathetus and a is 

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,820
then correspondingly the opposite cathetus 

116
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,500
that means in this triangle the 

117
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,620
sine of alpha is a by c as we 

118
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,200
see we have an equation with 

119
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
three parameters that means if we 

120
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,220
now insert two we can determine the 

121
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,100
third as a variable 

122
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,320
so if we know two quantities here, 

123
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,340
either an angle or a length 

124
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,160
or the length, we can 

125
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,620
determine the third quantity the sine 

126
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,920
function is 

127
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,140
programmed into the calculator this is the 
good 

128
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,000
news and is located under 

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,360
a sine button very important is 

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
the calculator or mathematics 

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,180
is also often calculated with the 

132
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,980
radial measure we We 

133
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,640
always calculate here in geometry with the 
degree 

134
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,020
mode. This means that we 

135
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,840
specify the angles in degrees. And that 
means it 

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,960
is very important that the 

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
calculators are also set to this degree 

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,380
mode. Otherwise the correct value is 

139
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,160
entered and the 

140
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,140
result is strange. 

141
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,600
Unfortunately, this then comes out in 
radians and we 

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,520
want it in degrees. 

143
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
It looks similar for the cosine and the 

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,720
tangent. The cosine of an 

145
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,180
angle is the anathema divided 

146
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,800
by the hypotenuse. We still have 

147
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
the same triangle as before. 

148
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,140
The right angle is at the top here. 

149
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,660
That means C is still our 

150
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,780
hypotenuse and our angle alpha is 

151
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,520
still at the bottom left. That means B 

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,920
is the anathema and therefore 

153
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,060
the cosine of alpha is B through C. 

154
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,610
The tangent is the trigonometric 

155
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,510
function where you don't 

156
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,770
need a hypotenuse . This means that we 
only need the 

157
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,990
anticathetus and the anathema because, as 

158
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,510
you can see, the tangent of the 

159
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,750
angle alpha is equal to the 

160
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,570
anticathetus through the anathema. 

161
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,610
Again, the same triangle as 

162
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,310
before, i.e. here is the 

163
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,750
right angle, that would be our 

164
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,450
hypotenuse, which we 

165
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,050
don't need for the tangent . B is 

166
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,950
therefore the anathema and A 

167
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,770
the anticathema. And 

168
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,010
we could now use this to 

169
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,670
calculate an angle. So much for that. 

170
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,430
Functions must also be in the 

171
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,670
formulary. However, it is 

172
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,470
definitely an advantage if you know them 

173
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,670
by heart. Then the knowledge is 

174
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,170
always available and you are 

175
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,270
more productive. 

176
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,610
So far, we have only used angles 

177
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,490
, or rather 

178
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,790
, as is almost always the case, there is 
of course also 

179
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,690
an inverse function. This 

180
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,470
inverse function is used when 

181
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,330
we want to calculate an angle. 

182
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,410
If we insert two side lengths 

183
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,770
and want to calculate an angle, 

184
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,950
we have to 

185
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,230

186
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,010
get the angle alpha from this sine 
function here. And for this we need 

187
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,050
the inverse function. And the 

188
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,910
inverse function of sine 

189
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,170
is sine raised to the power of minus 1. 
The 

190
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,570
inverse function of cosine 

191
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,330
is cosine raised to the power of minus 1 
and 

192
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,030
the tangent is tangent raised to the power 
of minus 1. 

193
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,410
It should be called 

194
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,030
arc sine instead of sine raised to the 
power of minus 1. 

195
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,670
However, on all calculators 

196
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,950
used in schools, 

197
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,890
sine raised to the power of minus 1 is 
used and this 

198
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,650
is also 

199
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,030
perfectly acceptable in a school context 
Well, as I said, 

200
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,710
this key is also on 

201
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,310
the calculator And this is how 

202
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,950
you use the sine raised to the power of 
minus 1 function, 

203
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,130
This is the inverse function And then 

204
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,270
you can 

205
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,190
rearrange it accordingly, as you can see 
here The important thing is that 

206
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,310
the sine raised to the power of minus 1 
naturally 

207
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,910
cancels out the sine, i.e. 

208
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,890
only alpha remains and if you 

209
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,130
didn't have anything before , then you 
take 

210
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,450
the sine raised to the power of minus 1 of 
A through C 

211
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,050
and can thus determine the angle. 

212
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,080
The three trinometric functions, 

213
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,180
sine, cosine and tangent, which 

214
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,260
have just been introduced, can 

215
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,940

216
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,780
only 

217
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,420
be used in a right-angled triangle , as 
was hopefully mentioned at the beginning. 

218
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,840
Unfortunately, if you have a triangle 

219
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,460
that 

220
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,900
is not right-angled 

221
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,820
, you cannot use them. This means 

222
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,340
that you first have to 

223
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,680
divide the triangle in such a way that 

224
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,460
you get a right-angled triangle. 

225
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,780
Unfortunately, this is not always 
possible. 

226
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,420
And if this 

227
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,220
is unfortunately not possible , you have 
to 

228
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,520
help yourself with other means. These are 

229
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,300
the sine and cosine theorems. These 

230
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,240
can also be used in 

231
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,900
non-right-angled triangles. And 

232
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,920
you can already see here that the sine 
theorem 

233
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,600
is A by the sine of alpha is 

234
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
equal to B by the sine of beta and 

235
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,800
that is equal to C by the sine of 

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,420
gamma. As you can see, it simply 

237
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,960
follows the alphabet ABC alpha beta 

238
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,700
gamma. And conversely, this means 

239
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,780
nothing more than the angle, the 

240
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,420
side divided by the sine of the 

241
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,440
opposite angle. If you 

242
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,820
look at this in a triangle 

243
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,520
, you will see this accordingly. 

244
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,240
So, as you can see here, you can use this 

245
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,700
very well to 

246
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,760
calculate a side or an angle if 

247
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
two angles and a side or two 

248
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,240
sides and an angle are given. 

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,740
In other words, if you have three 
quantities, 

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
you can calculate the fourth. This 

251
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,340
is very practical and 

252
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,400
, as 

253
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,480
mentioned earlier , also applies to 

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,160
non-right-angled triangles. 

255
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,420
You can see this here if we now 

256
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,380
know alpha, B and beta , for example. 

257
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,700
All we have to do is convert to A. This is 
quite 

258
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,720
simple if we 

259
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,040
multiply by the sine of alpha . Then the A 

260
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,100
is equal to B by the sine of beta 

261
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,960
times the sine of alpha. 

262
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,620
By inserting B, beta and alpha 

263
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,980
, we can now determine the 

264
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,480
side length A. The second 

265
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,820
possibility is the cosine theorem. 

266
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,260
That's why it's called the sine and 

267
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,800
cosine theorem. 

268
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,220
In my opinion, the cosine theorem is a 
little 

269
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,100
more complex. To use the cosine theorem 

270
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,060
, you always need two 

271
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,960
sides and the 

272
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,920
angles enclosed by the two sides. 

273
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,460
You can then use this information to 
determine the 

274
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,180
side opposite the angle , in this case 

275
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,700
c. You also need this 

276
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,160
quite often and the cosine theorem 

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,860
is simply c² equals a² plus b² 

278
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,680
minus 2ab times the cosine of phi. 

279
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,920
If you now 

280
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,240
want to calculate c directly, you can see 

281
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,600
the square root. This means that you 

282
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,060
can also go there and say that c is 

283
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,020
equal to the root of the whole. 

284
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,300
It's a bit quicker then, 

285
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,500
you 've saved yourself a calculation step, 

286
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,740
but otherwise it's absolutely 

287
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,880
correct, just as it says. Right, 

288
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,160
now let's move on to our 

289
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,780
example problems. We'll 

290
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,400

291
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,520

292
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,760
need the cosine theorem right at the end, 
I'll say it in advance, in example 
exercise 3 and then 

293
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,160
we'll go into it in more detail. 

294
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,740
Example problems 1 and 2 are 

295
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,500

296
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,740

297
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,300
to be solved with the normal three 
trigonometric functions, as I presented 
them at the beginning , and 

298
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,380
we will now take a 

299
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,160
closer look at them. Here we see 

300
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,620
example problem 1, where we 

301
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,780
have a right-angled 

302
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,980
triangle, which means we can 

303
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,600
work with sine, cosine or tangent. 

304
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,060
So we don't need a sine or 

305
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,380
cosine theorem. That's very 

306
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,460
good, because it's a 

307
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,500
bit quicker. We can also see that 

308
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,400
we have given two side lengths. 

309
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,280
And our task 

310
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,120
now is to 

311
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,800
calculate the missing angles and lengths. 
We can see that 

312
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,380
one length is currently missing, which is 

313
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,780
length B and two angles. We can 

314
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,920
now 

315
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,860
go with several possibilities. 

316
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,180
For example, we could use the Pythagorean 
theorem 

317
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,360
to help us 

318
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,380
calculate the length B. For now, however, 
we will 

319
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,040
continue or start with the angle alpha 

320
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,400
. To calculate the angle alpha 

321
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,220
, let's 

322
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,500
take a look at this. Here is the right 
angle, 

323
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,740
i.e. this side with the 7 cm 

324
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,720
is our hypotenuse, because it is 

325
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,580
opposite the right angle and also 

326
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,780
the longest side. If we 

327
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,840
look at the angle alpha here , then B is 

328
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,220
the anathema because it is at the angle 

329
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,860
and the 5 cm is the anticathema 

330
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,460
because it is opposite the angle. 

331
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,600
In other words, we know the opposite 
cathetus 

332
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,160
and hypotenuse. In other words, we choose 

333
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,620
the trigonometric function that 

334
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,120
contains these two components. And 

335
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
that is the sine. The sine is 

336
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,000
, after all, the sine of alpha is equal to 
the 

337
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,500
opposite cathetus divided by the 
hypotenuse. So 

338
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,060
in our case 5 cm by 7 cm. Because 

339
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,580
we 

340
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,660
want to calculate an angle in this case , 
we must 

341
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,920
of course use the inverse function, 

342
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,680
1 of 5 by 7 cm. And then 

343
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,920
we arrive at an angle of 45.6°. And 

344
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
so we have already 

345
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,260
calculated our angle alpha. Now 

346
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,340
we continue with side B. 

347
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,900
As I said, we 

348
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,000
could have helped ourselves with 
Pythagoras 

349
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,220
. But we can also 

350
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,340

351
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,960
calculate the cosine at the point where we 
know the angle alpha . 

352
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,560
We then take the angle and the 7 

353
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,000
cm, because we know that... is 

354
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,220
the hypotenuse, which is the 

355
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,520
anathema. Hypotenuse and anathema, 

356
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,520
then you take the cosine. 

357
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,880
Of course, we could also have used the 
tangent 

358
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,520
. That's what 

359
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,900
you need , the opposite cathetus and the 
anathema 

360
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,120
, that would also have 

361
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
been an option. As you can see, 

362
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,520
we decided to use the cosine 

363
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
and 

364
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,300
set it up for this purpose. The cosine of 
alpha 

365
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,440
is equal to B divided by C. In other 
words, this is 

366
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,660
the anathema, i.e. B divided 

367
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,520
by the hypotenuse C, which is 7 cm. 

368
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,780
And B is searched for accordingly, which 
means 

369
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,040
we have to 

370
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,000
multiply C across. So we arrive at the 

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,960
cosine of alpha times C equals B. 

372
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,060
Conveniently, we see that we 

373
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,400
don't need the inverse function of 

374
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,060
cosine, we can insert it directly 

375
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,520
and then it works. We have 

376
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
now done nothing more than 

377
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
insert alpha and C here. 

378
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,280
we have of course 

379
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,260
taken alpha from the previous calculation 
and so 

380
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,100
we arrive at b is equal to the 

381
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,400
cosine of 45.6 degrees times 7 cm, i.e. 

382
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,980
49 cm. now we know all three sides 

383
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,080
and an angle or we know that 

384
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,660
we have a right-angled triangle 

385
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,480
and we could 

386
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,220
of course 

387
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,560

388
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,620
calculate the last angle again using 
exaggerated metric functions , but it is 
much 

389
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,940
quicker using the interior angle theorem. 

390
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,460
The interior angle theorem says nothing 

391
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,360
more than that the sum of angles or 

392
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,780
the interior angle sum of a triangle 

393
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,060
must always be 180°. We have 

394
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,880
a right-angled triangle here, 

395
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,900
which means we have a 90° angle 

396
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,840
and the angle here, alpha, which 

397
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,880
we have already determined, has an 

398
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,000
angle of 45.6°. And so we can 

399
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,440

400
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,060
easily calculate the angle beta that we 
are missing. 180°, minus 45.6°, 

401
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,500
minus 90°, so that makes 44.4°. And 

402
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,020
so we have 

403
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,960
determined the three missing quantities. 

404
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,860
Let's continue with task 2. 

405
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,920
As you 

406
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,020
can probably see by now , task 2 is a text 
task. 

407
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,900
Whenever you are given a text task 

408
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,240
or a factual task like this 

409
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,460
, you should first think about 

410
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,760
where 

411
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,240
I can get my angle or 

412
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,740
triangle from if you are in trigonometry . 
As I said, this is very 

413
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,780
important, because we have to 

414
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,020

415
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,620
get a right-angled triangle in here 
somehow , otherwise we can't 

416
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,140
work. Well, a chimney that 

417
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,340
is 75 meters high casts a 70 

418
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,380
meter long shadow. Determine 

419
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,000
the width of the angle at which the 

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,700
sun's rays hit the flat ground 

421
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,240
. 

422
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,800

423
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500

424
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,700
In other words, we have to determine the 
angle between the sun's rays and the 
ground . 

425
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,120
So we have a chimney here and the 

426
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,080
chimney is, as it was 

427
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,120
built, perpendicular to the ground. This 

428
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,080
is then simply 

429
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,800
assumed in mathematics that it really 

430
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,760
is vertical. In reality, 

431
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,860
it may deviate slightly, 

432
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
but in mathematics we are always 

433
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,720
working ideally, so this 

434
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,100
chimney is vertical. Consequently, 

435
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,640
we have a right angle here. And 

436
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,840
now I think you can 

437
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,120
already see what it all boils down to. 

438
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,560
We have a right angle here, which 

439
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,760
is the hypotenuse. 

440
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,820
Now let's find this angle 

441
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,620
alpha. In other words, we have 

442
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,420
the opposite cathetus and the anathema. 

443
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,460
And if we 

444
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,060
know the opposite cathetus and the 
anathema, then there is 

445
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,340
of course only one trigonometric 

446
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,400
function that comes into question. That is 

447
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,760
the tangent. This is simply due to the 
fact 

448
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,160
that we have the opposite cathetus and the 

449
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,080
anathema and only the 

450
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,560
tangent has that . naturally want to 

451
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,780

452
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,560
calculate the angle accordingly. In other 
words, we use the 

453
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,980
tangent of alpha is equal to the 

454
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,200
anticatheter by the ancatheter, i.e. 

455
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,420
75 by 70. But we want to know 

456
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,740
what the angle alpha is, so 

457
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,300
we need the inverse function. This 

458
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,740
is the tangent to the power of minus 1. 
And so 

459
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,240
we calculate alpha is equal to the 

460
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,340
tangent to the power of minus 1 of 75 by 
70. 

461
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,760
And the calculator will give us 

462
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,760
an angle of 46.98 degrees. 

463
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,580
So we know that the 

464
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,340
sun's rays 

465
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,980
hit the ground at an angle of 45.98 
degrees 

466
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,200
. 

467
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,550
Now we come to 

468
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,850
what is probably the most difficult 

469
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,310
example problem. This is a 

470
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,530
triangle and I think we can all see 

471
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,510
straight away that it is not right-angled. 

472
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,330
So of course we can't 

473
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,730
use the sine, cosine and 

474
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,450
tangent. Whenever you 

475
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,790
have problems like this, I would 

476
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,990
advise you to 

477
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,530
enter the known quantities. So in our 
case, 

478
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,770
this is 4.5, this 

479
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,430
is 3 and this 

480
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,610
is 60 degrees. And I think you can see 
quite 

481
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,310
quickly that side A and 

482
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,150
side B 

483
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,650
enclose the known angle. And that's 

484
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,930
something that practically calls for the 

485
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,710
cosine theorem. We know two 

486
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,490
side lengths and these include the 

487
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,230
angle. And so, 

488
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,730
of course, we immediately use the cosine 
theorem. It 

489
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,530
says that c² is equal to a² plus b² 

490
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,170
minus 2ab times the cosine of Phi. 

491
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,170
I had already 

492
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,250
said earlier that we want to calculate 
here 

493
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,430
, so we write 

494
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,470
the root directly. 

495
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,450
Of course, this is also the first 

496
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,050
step here. So C is equal to the root 

497
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,850
of a² plus b² minus 2ab times the 

498
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,130
cosine of Phi. The only thing we 

499
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,870
have to do now is to 

500
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,330
insert a, b and phi. a we have 

501
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,970
just written down was 4.5 

502
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,750
cm and b was 3 cm. So we arrive at 

503
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,930
c is equal to the square root of 4.5 cm² 

504
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,530
plus 3 cm² minus 2 times 4.5 cm times 3 

505
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,830
cm. If you like, you can 

506
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,890
also enter a multipoint, 

507
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,990
times the cosine of 60°. 

508
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,110
We enter this completely into our 

509
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,270
calculator . I would 

510
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,610
also advise you to 

511
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,070
enter the root directly and not 

512
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,750
calculate the term under the root first . 

513
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,010
and the calculator will then give us 

514
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:40,690
a length of 3.97 cm. And that 

515
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,030
is already the length of 

516
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,770
side B. 

517
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,150
What you should pay attention to is that 

518
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,730
it doesn't really matter what tasks 

519
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,750
you are 

520
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,790
working on in geometry or trigonometry. 

521
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,290
Please always pay attention to the units. 
It is 

522
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,810
not guaranteed that the lengths will 

523
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,090
always 

524
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,410
be given to you in the same unit. It may 
well be 

525
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,970
that your teachers give you one 

526
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,650
side in Z... and one side in 

527
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,930
meters. And before you 

528
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,050
start calculating, you must 

529
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,930
of course set the side lengths to the 

530
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,290
same unit, otherwise 

531
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,410
you won't be able to start calculating. 

532
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,430
This is very important. 

533
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,630
Right, we have now 

534
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,590
calculated side C and we can 

535
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,690
of course continue. We have to 

536
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,950
calculate everything again, 

537
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,670
i.e. we also have to 

538
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,990
calculate beta and alpha . and we can now 

539
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,510
also 

540
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,990
determine the angle alpha using the cosine 
theorem . Using a² is 

541
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,130
equal to b² plus c² minus 2bc times the 

542
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,350
cosine of alpha. 

543
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,930
Of course, we have to rearrange this, 

544
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,590
because in this case, we 

545
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,730

546
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,910
already know the three lengths and we now 
want to 

547
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,990
determine the angle alpha. 

548
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,510
This means that we have to convert this 
whole term 

549
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,190
to the... cosine of alpha first 

550
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,670
. This is actually quite 

551
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,290
quick. We first calculate minus b² 

552
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,310
minus c² and then we arrive at a² 

553
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,370
minus b² minus c² equals minus 

554
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,950
2bc times the cosine of alpha. The 

555
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,030
next step is of course 

556
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,770

557
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,570
to divide by the factor in front of the 
trigonometric function, in this case 

558
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,910
divided by minus 2bc. Then 

559
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,650
we arrive at the cosine of alpha is 

560
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,190
equal to a² minus b² minus c² 

561
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,530
divided by minus 2 BC and the next 

562
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,670
step is, I think, already clear. 

563
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,430
We now have to 

564
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,790
choose the inverse function again , that 
is, 

565
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,030
I think there's a 

566
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,150
little problem with the representation 
here , we 

567
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,830
form the cosine to the power of minus 1 of 

568
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,810
these beautiful brackets. 

569
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,730
And as I said, we enter this 

570
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,890
completely into our calculator 

571
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,270
, enter the length a, b and c 

572
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,030
and the calculator will then 

573
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,930

574
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,570
give us a length of an angle of 79 
degrees, which 

575
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,010
is unfortunately missing on the last 

576
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,710
page, but alpha is 79 degrees and 

577
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,690

578
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,890
we can then 

579
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,930
calculate the missing angle betta again 
using the angle theorem, so even 

580
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,450
if there are always many ways 

581
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,650
to calculate this, always take 

582
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,490
the simplest one, think about it briefly 
and 

583
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,910
take the simplest one. If you 

584
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,710
know all but one interior angle, 

585
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,590
then you can always use 

586
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,370
the interior angle theorem for 

587
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,270
triangles. Really always. There is also 

588
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,230
one for a quadrilateral, but we are 

589
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,270
actually only dealing with triangles here. 

590
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,370
In other words, it's always 180 

591
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:41,270
degrees. If you 

592
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,530
have a right-angled triangle and you know 
two 

593
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,910
side lengths, then you can 

594
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,810
also find the third using Pythagoras. 

595
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,010
Of course, this doesn't work here because 
we 

596
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,070
don't have a right-angled triangle, but 

597
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,490
the interior angle theorem 

598
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,170
still applies here , as it applies to 
every 

599
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,430
triangle. This means that we also have 

600
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,130
an interior angle sum of 180° here. 

601
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,030
We know gamma and alpha 

602
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,610
, which means that we calculate beta 
equals 

603
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,590
180°, minus 79°, minus 60° and then 

604
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,950
we know that the angle beta is 41° 

605
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,670
. And that means we have 

606
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,610
already 

607
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,600
calculated the three missing variables. 
That brings us to 

608
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
the end of the webinar. I hope you 

609
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,680
enjoyed the webinar and 

610
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
were able to take something away with you. 

611
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,780
In any case, thank you for your 

612
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,760
attention and 

613
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,620
have a nice evening.
