1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,760
So, hello and welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,420
today in Latin for translating 

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,680
longer texts. There are 

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,740
eight of us at the moment . Can you please 
write in 

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,080
the chat if you 

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,280
can hear me and if you 

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,100
can see the presentation. 

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,780
Okay, perfect. Very good. Okay, nice to 
meet you 

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,500
. Okay, exactly. So my name is 

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,740
Sarah Fischer. I'm going to 

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,400
give the presentation first and I 

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,340
'm open to questions at the end or 

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,800
if I need to explain something again, 

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,560
call out something again. Exactly, like 
this. 

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,680
So the topic today, as 

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,740
I said, is the translation of longer 

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,280
texts into Latin. Yes, first 

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,920
we'll look at the underlining method, 

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,100
then the indentation method, then 

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,680
text indexing and finally there are 

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,000
a few tips for 

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,500
translating longer texts. 

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,580
So that's the text example that 

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,000
we 

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
'll have here the whole time. But I'm 

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,400
just going to read it out now and then 

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,060
we'll continue working with it. 

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,920
Illum uno di ficisse intelligierend 

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,600
legatus ad eum mitunt. Exactly, that's 

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,160
our text example. And with the 

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,980
underlining method, the first thing 

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,860
to do is to mark the predicates 

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,840
. And also, but preferably 

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,620
in a different color, the 

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,920
corresponding subjects. Exactly, here 

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,440
the first predicate is konfecker 

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,240
, then Transierend, then Intelligerend 

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,180
and then Mithund. I would 

39
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,220
simply recommend that you 

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,060
go through the text like this. Is that a 
predicate? 

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,100
No, no, no. Just 

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,620
really 

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,040
look systematically word by word , okay, 
is it a predicate? 

44
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,000
Exactly. The next step would be to 

45
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,060

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,440
mark different introductory words. So all 
the ones you 

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,540
can find. In this case, it's cum, it 

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,760
's quad and it's ut. 

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,500
The next step, very important, oh 

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,480
my God, is to mark sentence-value 
constructions 

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,880
. You 

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,760
often find that you 

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,400
want to translate things. Many people do 
it word 

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,460
for word and if you 

55
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,060
ignore the constructions 

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,520
, nothing 

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,300
makes sense afterwards. That's right, the 

58
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,440
construction of little sentences. Here, 

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,540
for example, repentino eius 

60
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,300
adventu comoti. Exactly, that would be 

61
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,760
an applativus 

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,880
absolutus in this case , recognizable by 
the fact 

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,960
that all the words are in the appliative. 

64
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,600
Correct. So, then ilum uno die die 

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,300
fekisse. 

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,220
Yes, these are our constructions 

67
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,500
in this case. So, then you first mark 

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,780
the main clause. Yes, in this case 

69
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,520
it's Helvetii, Repentino, Eius, 

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,780
Adventu, Komoti, Legatus, Ad, Eum, 

71
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,480
Mittund. Yes, of course, it's a long 

72
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,520
sentence, so it's sometimes 

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
difficult to 

74
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,700
filter out the main clause, so to speak, 

75
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,800
but I would still 

76
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,260
start with the main clause. I know 

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,020
some people start 

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,720
marking subordinate clauses, but it's 

79
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,340
easier if you 

80
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,540
look for the main clause first. Exactly. 
Which 

81
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,840
might explain how 

82
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
you can find out that it 

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,180
's the main clause. Exactly, so 

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,080
this cum it is logically 

85
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,820
a subordinate clause . Then the quad, we' 

86
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,160
ve just marked the introductory words 

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,040
, and these are all 

88
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,380
subordinate clauses, and here illum uno 
the 

89
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,760
ficisse intelliging, we 

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,740
also know that it's a subordinate clause, 
precisely 

91
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,960
because the construction says so. 

92
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,900
So, then you mark the subordinate clause 

93
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,640
of the first degree, which is of course 
also 

94
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,540
a difficulty in longer 

95
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,800
texts, that subordinate clauses are also 

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,680
distributed throughout the sentence. That 
would be 

97
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,820
practical if they were all simply 

98
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,240
one after the other. 

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,940
In this case, however, the 1st 

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,500
degree subordinate clause would be 

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,340
exact. You can 

102
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,920
probably already guess the next step. This 
is 

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,440
the 2nd degree subordinate clause that you 

104
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,020
should mark. That's yes, 

105
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,740
and then comes the 3rd 

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,000
degree subordinate clause That's the short 
one here. Ut 

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,380
flummen transirent. Like this. And then 

108
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,720
we can do a translation. 

109
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,520
What I 

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,680
would recommend anyway , you've sort of 

111
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,860
assigned everything and thought about 
where 

112
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,200
it belongs and so on, that you still 

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,320
start with the main clause. So, the 

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,460
Helvetii were 

115
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,980
very moved by his sudden arrival and 

116
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,060
so they sent envoys to 

117
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,940
him. That would be the translation of the 

118
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,320
main clause. And you can also write it 

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,120

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,780
like that in the exams or whatever. You 
can 

121
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,400
write the main clause at the beginning, 
then 

122
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,280
the subordinate clause of the first 
degree, second 

123
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,320
degree, third degree. You can 

124
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,460
do it like this, but then it's 

125
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,820
not so nice in German , but it's still 

126
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
grammatically correct. If 

127
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,280
you can do it the way it is here, 

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
then of course everything is fine. 

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,980
I just wanted to say that there 

130
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,060
is another alternative. 

131
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,920
Exactly. Then the first 

132
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,440
subordinate clause follows. Because they 
realized that 

133
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,640
he 

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,620

135
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,040

136
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,440
had done in a single day what they 
themselves had spent 20 days doing with 
extreme difficulty, namely crossing the 
river. Yes, 

137
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,480
and then the 

138
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,540
next part of the speech follows. And 

139
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,560
so they sent envoys to him. 

140
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,980
Yes, here it's more or less, 

141
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,800
not as I 

142
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,400
mentioned as an option, for example, but 
here 

143
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,180
it's really very 

144
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,200
much based on the Latin 

145
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,000
sentence. 

146
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,340
Yes, exactly. Then, we continue 

147
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,920
with the indentation method. This is the 

148
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,880
exact same text. Text example, 

149
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,260
so I'm not going to 

150
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,320
read it out again. Exactly. I 

151
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,580
might give you a few moments to 

152
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,340
read through that again, but it 

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,140
's exactly what we've just 

154
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,800
been covering the whole time. 

155
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,890
Okay. Yes. Should be enough, I think. 

156
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,710
Okay. Yes. In the set-up method, 

157
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,770
you write the main and 

158
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,210
subordinate clauses one below the other 
and 

159
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,070
, as before, you 

160
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,990
use commas and introductions. 

161
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,870
words. In other words, this is our 

162
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,850
text example here and Helvetii repentino 

163
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,750
eius adventu comoti up to the comma, 

164
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,190
then you start a new line, 

165
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,730
as you can see here, a cum 

166
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,130
it, then comes a comma, okay, then 

167
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,590
I write Quod ipsi diebus and so 

168
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,870
on under the line, then Ut 

169
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,710
flumen transirent, new line and so 

170
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,690
on. Exactly, what they 

171
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,910
've done here directly is also 

172
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,550
marked the introductory words, but in 

173
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,390
this case it's enough if you 

174
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,250

175
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,450
write it in the right order. 

176
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,850
I personally find this 

177
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,250
option very useful because it gives you 

178
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,430
a bit of an 

179
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,250
overview. I think you're 

180
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,830
otherwise a bit overwhelmed by such a 

181
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,290
long text and don't know 

182
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,930
what to do now, no? exactly, and 

183
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,950
then you just start 

184
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,530

185
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,850
indenting the subordinate clauses 
according to the degree of dependency. So, 

186
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,910
you start with the main clause, then 

187
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,770
the subordinate clause of the first degree 
follows, 

188
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,410
then the second degree, then the third and 

189
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,770
that belongs to the first again and 

190
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,450
that is then the main clause again. Yes, 

191
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,490
and so you have a kind of, yes, 

192
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,510
graphic exercise. where what belongs and 

193
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,390
how you can translate it. 

194
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,090
Exactly. 

195
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,940
So, let's translate that 

196
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,560
one after the other, which I've already 

197
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,520
suggested to you a bit. So 

198
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,820
just Helvetii, Repentino, Eius, 

199
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,060
Advento, Komoti, Legatos, Atheum, 

200
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,460
Mittund. The Helvetii 

201
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,560
were very moved by his sudden arrival 

202
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,520
and so they sent envoys to 

203
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,980
him. Then you sort of start with this, 

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,580
shall I say, shall I say, outer framework 

205
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,370
. Like this. Then you translate the 

206
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,730
subordinate clause of the first degree, 
i.e. cum id 

207
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,330
illum uno die ficisse intelligirent. 

208
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,290
Yes. The Helvetii were 

209
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,390
very moved by his sudden arrival because 

210
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,210
they realized that he 

211
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,650
had done this in a single day and 

212
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,450
so they sent envoys to him. 

213
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,910
So. Then comes the subordinate clause. 
Second 

214
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,830
degree, Quot ipsi diebus viginti 

215
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,750
egerime confickerant. The Helvetii 

216
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,350
were 

217
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,950
greatly moved by his sudden arrival 
because they realized that 

218
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,130
he 

219
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,690

220
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,570

221
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,870
had done in a single day what , note, 
subordinate clause of the second degree, 
they themselves had spent 20 days doing 
with extreme difficulty, 

222
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,310
and they therefore sent envoys to 

223
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,050
him. So, logically, now comes 

224
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,810
the third-degree clause, because we 

225
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,130
already 

226
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,310
have the outer construct , it's no 

227
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,230
longer difficult to 

228
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,090
weave that into it in a meaningful way . 

229
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,830
Exactly, the translation of Ut flumen 

230
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,090
transirent is, namely to 

231
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,930
cross the river , is again the whole 

232
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,950
translation, The Helvetii were 

233
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,770
very 

234
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,330
moved by his sudden arrival , because they 
realized that he 

235
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,750

236
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,390

237
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,050

238
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,050
had done in a single day what they 
themselves had spent 20 days doing with 
extreme difficulty, namely crossing the 
river, and 

239
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,970
they therefore sent envoys to 

240
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,570
him. Yes, exactly. What I would also 

241
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,210
like to say about the method is that it 

242
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,910
takes a little longer than 

243
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,610
the underlining method, for example. 

244
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,290
Because you 

245
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,230
have to draw it on, so to speak. So really 

246
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,510
only for a long, complicated 

247
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,030
sentence in the paper or in the 

248
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,290
exam. But then I 

249
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,850
personally find it very clear. 

250
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,430
And you don't forget any sentences or 
anything, which 

251
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,610

252
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,650
often happens. Instead, you know, okay, 
this is how 

253
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,190
I'm going to proceed, I have a structure. 

254
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,930
And then you're often 

255
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,450
a bit calmer for yourself. And 

256
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,590
unfortunately, in Latin it 

257
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,410
often has to do with nerves 

258
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,330
, because time is pressing. 

259
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,750
Okay. Yes, the text indexing. 

260
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,930
I can recommend that to you so, so much 

261
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,010
. It's so important that you 

262
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,770

263
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,950

264
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,530

265
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,890
learn the content of the area that the 
exam or paper or test is about in advance. 
That you learn, 

266
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,430
okay, these words are... 

267
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,610
are often used and these 

268
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,370
sentences or words are often used in the 
ACI 

269
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,970
. Often the 

270
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,570
appellative of the absolute looks like 
this or 

271
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,490
yes, okay, this is now the word field, 

272
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,410
I'll say court, I learn everything 

273
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,570
in detail, what judge means 

274
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,450
and so on. So, 

275
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,490
to instruct prior knowledge or even if you 
know, 

276
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,050
okay, it's now about 

277
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,410
Pliny the Younger, for example, about 
these 

278
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,130
letters. Exactly, that you 

279
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,270
know a bit of the basics, okay, when 

280
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,190
was he where, what does he do, so that you 

281
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,250

282
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,290
have a bit of an idea of the content 
yourself , I say 

283
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,950
. So, and that's actually 

284
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,150
the most important thing for me, 

285
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,910
pay attention to the heading , because 
that 

286
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,270
leads to the main topic. In most exams and 

287
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,890
papers, there is not only a 

288
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,850
German heading, but also 

289
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,870
a small introductory text. Yes, it's so 

290
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,530
important and actually so easy to 

291
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,350
read through and keep it in mind 

292
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,970
, because the text 

293
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,390
that you then have to translate 

294
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,490
is adapted to it, in other words, 

295
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,690
it's basically a 

296
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,830
continuation of this 

297
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,410
introductory text. In other words, you can 

298
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,010
get stuck on the content 

299
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,450
and think, okay, does this make 

300
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,370
sense in the context of the text? In terms 

301
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,010
of the headline, does my text 

302
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,830
now say what the headline 

303
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,330
means? That's a very 

304
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,810
important tip for me. Then consider 

305
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,050
what type of text it is. Is it a 

306
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,010
report, a speech, a letter, a story, 

307
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,850
whatever, or a dialog? Then, 

308
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,830
which people are involved? 

309
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,210
Generally speaking, 

310
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,590
you can 

311
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,370
mark key terms and keywords if you like. 

312
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,790
Power, yes, place and time, 

313
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,430
various connectors, okay, how 

314
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,410
does that fit together? Then the 

315
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,930
protagonists and very essential 

316
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,330
tempos. Whenever you 

317
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,630
have time at the end, check everything 
again 

318
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,690
. Do I have the right 

319
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,410
time zones, I say now, right? 

320
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,710
Important with the constructions, what 
about 

321
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,990
the ACI again? Yes, is 

322
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,090
it simultaneous, after the fact? 

323
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,590
Premature have I 

324
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,670
reproduced that correctly? Is it imperfect 
or 

325
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,870
perfect? All that sort of thing, right? 
Yes, 

326
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,950
you probably already know all that, 

327
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,370
but it's so important because you 

328
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,770

329
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,250
make these annoying mistakes , right? 
Because sometimes you 

330
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,650
overlook things even though you actually 

331
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,890
know it. Yes, exactly. I just wanted to 

332
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,550
say that again. Exactly, then a 

333
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,150
few more tips for translating 

334
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,810
longer texts. That you 

335
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,050
read the text slowly and thoroughly 
several times. that 

336
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,790
you mark the predicates, which we 

337
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,270
also just did, and 

338
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,250
find the corresponding subjects, or 

339
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,090
if the subject 

340
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,930
is in the predicate, that you put an 

341
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,310
asterisk or something so that you 

342
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,190
know, okay, the subject is already there, 

343
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,230
I don't need to look for it anymore. 

344
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,930
Exactly, and 

345
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,270
mark and 

346
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,990
delimit sentence-value constructions . 
I've already 

347
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,050
talked about that, what's 

348
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,210
so annoying is when you 

349
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,870
see them too late and you 

350
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,390
've already translated the whole sentence 
and it doesn't 

351
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,750
make any sense and then you realize, ah, 
okay, 

352
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,670
damn, I 

353
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,810
missed the applantius absolutus or 
something, right? 

354
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,070

355
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,010
You can use graphic display options , for 
example, like 

356
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,210
what we just did, with 

357
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,010
the insertion, uh, indentation, yes. 

358
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,110
were they translated correctly, time 

359
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,270
fits and so on, right? All the 

360
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,790
Kasi. Yes, then 

361
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,330

362
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,990
finding the right meaning for a word in 
context , so 

363
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,090
practising using the dictionary . Yes, I 
can 

364
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,870
really only recommend that. Come on, 

365
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,750
you're probably all 

366
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,650
at different levels, some of you 

367
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,550
might not be allowed to 

368
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,630
use a dictionary yet. If you 

369
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,950
are allowed to use a dictionary, very, 
very 

370
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,170
important if you are 

371
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,890
translating original reading, for example. 
I say 

372
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,410
, yes, Ovid for example. And 

373
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,150
the dictionaries 

374
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,250
contain very long entries because a word 

375
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,010
can have 30 meanings. That's why 

376
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,630
it's not so easy 

377
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,870
with dictionary translations in Latin. But 

378
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,830
it often says something like frequently in 

379
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,090
Ovid or frequently in Cicero. And then 

380
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,850
there is a usage or even 

381
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,050
a whole expression that is 

382
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,230
probably also in your 

383
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,710
text, as the word 

384
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,550
is frequently used by him. And that is 

385
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,670
often the correct 

386
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,190
translation, but you can 

387
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,770
also search for it. Don't always 

388
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,490
go straight for the first translation, 

389
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,410
but rather think a bit 

390
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,770
about the context and the 

391
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,010
author. Yes, I' 

392
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,410
ve already said that you 

393
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,970

394
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,270
can take sentences that are convoluted 

395
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,030
and make them one after the other, rather 
than 

396
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,990
not 

397
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,450
making a proper German sentence in German. 

398
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,630
Of course, that would also be super 
annoying. 

399
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,610
Logical relationships have to be 

400
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,770
taken into account and these should also 
be 

401
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,430

402
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,170
clarified with the correct conjunctions in 
German. 

403
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,490
It's also logical if I 

404
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,630
have a post tense or a pre tense that 

405
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,750
I then 

406
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,790
use, for example, after the . But often 
the 

407
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,410
conjunctions are also in Latin and you 

408
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,970
have to translate them anyway. Exactly. 

409
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,410
So, now I've 

410
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,270
talked quite a lot . 

411
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,310
Thank you for your attention. Exactly. Now 

412
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,670
I'm open to questions if you want me 

413
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,870
to call something up again. 

414
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,430
Feedback is also welcome . Exactly. 

415
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,510
Okay. 

416
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,960
Yes, I'm pleased about that. Good that 
you' 

417
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,800
ve understood. That's right. 

418
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,210
I'm glad about that. So those of 

419
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,650
you who don't have 

420
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,190
any more questions or anything, you' 

421
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,070
re welcome to leave the webinar if you 

422
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,250
want. I'll 

423
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,670
wait for all the other feedback, but 

424
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,370
of course you don't have to 

425
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,270
wait here in the room during that time. 
Exactly. 

426
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,710
And right, of course I wish you 

427
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,250
a nice day and so on. 

428
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,810
I almost forgot now. 

429
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,190
I'll probably see you 

430
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,940
again at 2 pm. Okay. 

431
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,180
Yes. Then I would definitely like to thank 
you 

432
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,720
for your attention. Exactly. 

433
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,800
No more feedback here. 

434
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,600
Have a nice day or see you soon. 

435
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,560
Bye.
