00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,740
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,640
another Schülerhilfe webinar 

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,780
on the topic of content writing. I see 

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,960
that Ann-Kathrin and 

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,440
Annika are here. They were also 

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,180
present at my last webinar. 

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,900
Is that correct? Then I 

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,040

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,760
don't think I need to do the whole 
introduction again. 

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,640
Welcome and then we'll talk about 

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,000
the synopsis right away. 

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,160
Right, great. 

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,820
Great, all right. Wonderful then. 

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,820
As a reminder, I'm 

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,220
Kathi, so you can also address me as Kathi 

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,060
. Since we've 

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,180
become a rather small group now 

18
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,560
, I only have the two of you 

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,220
right now, I could imagine 

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,060
that you can simply 

21
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,940
write a short stop in the chat at any time 

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,560
if you have a question, then 

23
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,100
I' ll see it very quickly and can then 

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,820
take a break immediately. 

25
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,700
Then we don't need anything 

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,380
in between. So you can 

27
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,280
stop me at any time and ask a 

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,040
question. I think that's in 

29
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,500
everyone's interest. Okay, then 

30
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,720
I' d like to get straight to it. Where's 

31
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,800
my pointer? My pointer has 

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,480
disappeared. There it is. There it is. 

33
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,280
Let's go. Here's what we're going to do. 

34
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,680
First, let's take a quick look 

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,340
at typical tasks. What do 

36
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,100
tasks look like that 

37
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,120
are aimed at a summary? Then the really 

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,920
important part of this 

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,740
presentation is this one, 

40
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,220
namely rules for writing a 

41
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,760
summary, what do I 

42
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,240
actually have to consider? And then at the 
end, 

43
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,300
a little bit about the structure 

44
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,420
of a synopsis, or 

45
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,520
sometimes it's also 

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,540
called a text reproduction. There is a 
small 

47
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,100
distinction, which I would 

48
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,120
also briefly mention. So, 

49
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,480
what do typical assignments 

50
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,820
look like? We have 

51
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,940
summarized four examples for you here . 
These 

52
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,560
are as follows. Task 1 

53
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,900
or Task A. Provide a 

54
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,980
structured summary of the 

55
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,020
text. One word is missing. An 

56
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,020
should be the word. Or 

57
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,920
describe the content in your own words. 
And 

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,000
I would like to 

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,820
emphasize the own words here. 

60
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,060
I'll 

61
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,180
say something about that in a moment. Or 
the task could be to 

62
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,820

63
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,220
summarize the most important details. Or 
it could 

64
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,280
be to describe the content 

65
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,300
and the course of the conversation. 

66
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,440
Of course, the example can also be 
something 

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,820
else, but describe 

68
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,020
the content and the course of the 

69
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,400
conversation. Only selected examples. 

70
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,260
Of course, one or two 

71
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,580
teachers will also come up with a slightly 

72
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,240
different way of writing it, 

73
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,500
but it will usually be based 

74
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,690
on these formulations. What 

75
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,110
are typical tasks and 

76
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,610
what do I need to solve them? 

77
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,350
I need the following skills. 

78
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,570
I need to be structured. 

79
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,830
I need to be able to plan well in order to 

80
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,190
write a good summary. I need 

81
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,290
to be able to express myself well, because 
the 

82
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,470
text is supposed to 

83
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,890
be rendered in my own words and not 

84
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,310
simply retold. In 

85
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,010
other words 

86
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,810
, I need to 

87
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,390
have a certain level of expressive 
competence. And of course, before 

88
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,050
I even 

89
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,810
start a summary, I should 

90
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,690
have a good understanding of the text or 

91
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,530

92
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,390
have recognized the most important 
aspects. In other words, my reading skills 

93
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,790
also play a very important 

94
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,190
role. So you see, 

95
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,570
you need a 

96
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,550
bit more than the 

97
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,810
standard for a synopsis . A synopsis 

98
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,130
is always 

99
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,310
perceived as particularly simple. Yes, 
yes, a synopsis is 

100
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,850
usually task 1, but 

101
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,110
of course it shouldn't be 

102
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,850
underestimated. So, now comes 

103
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,290
the core issue, namely the rules 

104
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,430
for writing a 

105
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,170
synopsis. Once again 

106
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,370
, the emphasis here is that the 

107
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,510
synopsis 

108
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,290
is not a retelling . In a 

109
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,190
retelling , you normally want to 

110
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,950
be very close to the text, or very 

111
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,910
close to the action. So you have a 

112
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,530
high degree of fidelity to the text, they 
say. The 

113
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,770
text is 

114
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,470
reproduced as accurately and completely as 
possible , but 

115
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,810
that 's exactly what we don't want. In 
other words, we want 

116
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,530
to delete this directly. We 

117
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,370
don't want a retelling. No, 

118
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,770
this is what we want. We want to 

119
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,290

120
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,270

121
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,590
focus on individual, particularly 
important, i.e. elementary aspects of the 
text and reproduce them. 

122
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,210
This may 

123
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,070
or may not be meant as a summary. 

124
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,590
I'll go into this in more detail in a 
moment 

125
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,970
. But it is very important to me 

126
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,990
to 

127
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,770
delete this word here immediately. It must 
not 

128
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,810
become a retelling. Then there are 

129
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,910
rules - you know them, 

130
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,950
hopefully you' ve heard them a hundred 
times - 

131
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,430
that a synopsis 

132
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,570
should be written in the 

133
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,170
present tense . And only in 

134
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,610
exceptions, for example if something 

135
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,070
has happened immediately beforehand, then 

136
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,350
in the perfect tense. Here's another very 

137
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,950
brief digression 

138
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,770
to remind you of this. Presence 

139
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,350
is the present tense. For example, the 

140
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,230
protagonist regularly 

141
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,510
meets his neighbor on the stairs. This is 

142
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,190
the normal present tense. 

143
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,230
Perfect is, the protagonist 

144
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,910
regularly met his neighbor there 

145
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,530
. And the simple 

146
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,390
past would be, the protagonist 

147
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,150
regularly met 

148
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,870
his neighbor at the stairs. So, as 

149
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,830
I said, this is the most important thing. 

150
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,390
It's always written in the present tense. 

151
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,050
There may be exceptions. 

152
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,470
But it always depends on the text. 

153
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,530
Then, because another important 

154
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,870
rule, direct 

155
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,510
speech is never used. Yes, so direct 

156
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,770
speech is best immediately 

157
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,210
changed to indirect speech. Whereby, 

158
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,650
and I think this should even be 

159
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,610
in red, you should 

160
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,770
think about whether this content, this 

161
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,450
direct speech, someone is saying 

162
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,290
something, whether it is important 

163
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,410
for the summary at all. So that's 

164
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,030
important. For example, if you have 

165
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,050
the feeling that the whole text 

166
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,970
somehow revolves around a certain sentence 

167
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,130
that some character 

168
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,750
has said before , then that would of 
course be 

169
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,930
particularly important, should still 

170
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,330
be converted into indirect speech 

171
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,670
, but should 

172
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,190
also be central to your synopsis. 

173
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,700
Another brief digression on 

174
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,040
direct and indirect speech. The 

175
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,780
protagonist calls out, am I not the 

176
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,680
helmsman? Of course, you wouldn 

177
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,280
't write this exactly in your 

178
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
summary, but you would 

179
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
write that the protagonist asks about 

180
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,040
the legitimacy of his role as 

181
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
helmsman. Just as an example, 

182
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,420
nicely formulated. Not everyone has 

183
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,500
this level of 

184
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,140
expressive competence. It could 

185
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,720
look like this if you really 

186
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,140
want to formulate it beautifully , but of 
course it can 

187
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,580
also look different. The important thing 
is 

188
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,300
that the indirect speech 

189
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,420
is off. This is a second 

190
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,940
example, but I think one is enough 

191
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,620
at this point. These are 

192
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,180
individual speeches, individual 

193
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,700
phrases, perhaps individual 

194
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,920
quotations. If there are whole dialogues, 
for 

195
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,540
example longer dialogues, you 

196
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,760
don't have to 

197
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,140
reproduce every single statement, but 
rather 

198
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,620

199
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,380
summarize the meaning and the course or 
simply the result, 

200
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,900
depending on what you think is important 

201
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,640
for the summary. and not 

202
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,700
all the content and the whole 

203
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,240
course. So rather, what 

204
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,720
is the most important development, the 

205
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,480
most important event? 

206
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,660
Of course, this should be included in a 
synopsis 

207
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,160
, but not all the 

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,880
details. 

209
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,140
Then, it actually still happens 

210
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,920
frighteningly often that 

211
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,980
students 

212
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,500

213
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,740
write synopses in the first person. 
Something is 

214
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,900
written, I have read this, 

215
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,980
very, very, very unfavorably. It is 

216
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,540
never written in the first person. 

217
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
The summary should, and now 

218
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,680
it's getting very highbrow again, 

219
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,640

220
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,780
have a normative general validity. This 
means that there should 

221
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,440

222
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,620
be no explicit reference to the writer. In 
simple 

223
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,140
German terms , this means that if the 

224
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,620
narrative to be summarized 

225
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,960
is written in the first person, it is 

226
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,160
 converted to R-S-V .  An example. 

227
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,040
drinking coffee outside under the lime 
trees. 

228
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,060
Because she didn't quite suit me, 

229
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,860
I stayed 

230
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,440
behind on a pretext . That's what the text 
says. That 

231
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,920
's perhaps very important for you. 

232
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,340
The whole text somehow revolves 

233
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,400
around exactly this. This statement 

234
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,000
that the character has written. 

235
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,220
Then you write this in your 

236
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,780
summary of course, but 

237
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,720
in the R form. For example, 

238
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,280
Werther turned down an invitation to a 

239
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,100
party under the lime trees on 

240
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,680
a pretext. That's the first person 

241
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,100
 form, which of course you don't 

242
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,280
use in the synopsis. So, and 

243
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,040
here, which I would have liked to 

244
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,020
underline in red anyway , the content is 

245
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,340
not retold, but must 

246
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,820

247
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,180
be reproduced in your own words. Of 
course, 

248
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,680
certain 

249
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,720
key words from the text 

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,140
can be used if they 

251
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,880
are particularly important, but by no 

252
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,280
means whole parts of sentences 

253
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,200
or even whole sentences. That would be a 

254
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,080
pure retelling and 

255
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,720
not an original contribution at all , it 
wouldn 

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
't even be a summary and 

257
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,180
you really wouldn't get any 

258
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,880
points. So, once again, 

259
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,060
not every 

260
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,040
single paragraph, not every 

261
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,440
single conversation, not every 

262
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,580
single quote has to 

263
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,520
be paraphrased . It can also 

264
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,340
be paraphrased, as we did 

265
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,960
in this example. This 

266
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,920
is a pure paraphrasing 

267
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,060
from the first person to the first person 
or from 

268
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,580
direct to indirect speech. This 

269
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,900
is only done when it 

270
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,880
is important. But you should think about 

271
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,500
it first: do I have to 

272
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,280
paraphrase this? Is it 

273
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,560
important at all ? In most cases, it's 

274
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
not. For the summary, you should 

275
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,940
actually 

276
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,220
condense the most important aspects of the 
text, 

277
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,940
in a very concentrated way and not 
sentence by 

278
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,320
sentence . 

279
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,750
Then, the summary is 

280
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,210
written very factually. This is in 

281
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,630
contrast to the retelling 

282
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,630
, which I have already mentioned several 
times 

283
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,350
. The retelling 

284
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,930
wants 

285
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,010
to be close to the action, vivid, lively, 

286
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,010
exciting. In the synopsis 

287
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,650
, something like this should 

288
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,370
be given as far as possible. So you don't 

289
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,790
need words like suddenly or suddenly 

290
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,330
someone was standing behind 

291
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,290
someone else. It should not 

292
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,770
create any suspense at all , it should not 

293
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,170
embellish, no narrative techniques 

294
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,930
should be used. It should simply 

295
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,310

296
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,810
be a functional text. In other words, it 
should not 

297
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,030
be entertaining, it should 

298
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,770
simply inform. Quite 

299
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,430
factually. 

300
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,360
As already mentioned here, the 

301
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,640
synopsis is limited to the 

302
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
essential details of the 

303
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,320
original and should therefore 

304
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,440
be shorter than the original text, and 

305
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,140
the synopsis does not contain any 

306
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,960
evaluations, comments or 

307
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,940
interpretations. These are, so to speak, 

308
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
the two summarizing sentences 

309
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,900

310
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,420

311
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,120
that make up the rules for writing a 
synopsis. And I can also see 

312
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,560
that you, 

313
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,700
of course I can see that you 

314
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,420
don't ask any questions. 

315
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,320
So I continue to assume that 

316
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,640
there are no questions either. As long as 

317
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,140
you don't write anything, I'll 

318
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,520
just continue. You 

319
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,440
just stop me when something comes up. And 
at the 

320
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,540
end, I'll give you another 

321
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,780
opportunity to ask questions anyway. 

322
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Also remember to 

323
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,300

324
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,960
make a note of the slide number so that I 

325
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,340
can jump back to a slide if necessary. 

326
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,630
Then we come to the 

327
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,290
third point, namely the structure of the 

328
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,230
table of contents. I'm sure you 

329
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,090
've often heard the standard 

330
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,970
introduction, main body and conclusion. 
The 

331
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,470
summary of a 

332
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,170
fictional text, for example, describes the 
narrative 

333
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,150
events. That's the case with 

334
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,570
fictional texts. But 

335
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,090
then let's talk about non-fiction texts. 
In the context 

336
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,790
of non-fiction texts, we tend to talk 
about 

337
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,390
this reproduction of the text. I mentioned 
this 

338
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,530
at the very beginning. 

339
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,330
Sometimes we don't say 

340
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,210
content description, but 

341
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,210
text reproduction. This is 

342
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,990
the case with factual texts, for example, 
as 

343
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,390
statements and trains of thought 

344
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,550

345
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,250
are presented in a very condensed, 
concentrated way. Whether 

346
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,770
it is a summary 

347
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,570
or a reproduction of the text is 

348
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,550
completely irrelevant when it comes to 
classification. In each 

349
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,050
case, it is still about the 

350
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,290
introduction, which 

351
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,830
must be written , and a main body. 

352
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,670
The introduction is actually 

353
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,050
very easy to 

354
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,310
formulate by default because it contains 
the most important 

355
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,470
information. The main body 

356
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,030
is actually exactly what you 

357
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,610
need to focus on and for which you 

358
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,370

359
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,130
get most of the points. Summary. What 
belongs in 

360
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,630
the introduction? This will 

361
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,150
probably and hopefully 

362
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,450
already be hanging out of your ears. The 

363
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,670
author must be named, 

364
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,190
or the 

365
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,990
title of the text . What kind of 

366
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,530
text is it? 

367
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,450
Is it a diary entry , for example ? That 
would be 

368
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,350
a non-fictional text. Or 

369
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,470
is it an opera? A 

370
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,510
tragedy? Which would be an example of a 

371
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,170
drama, for example? I 

372
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,010
don't know , I think you were both 

373
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,450
in the drama at the time. That would be an 

374
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,210
example of a 

375
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,130
fictional text. Or is it 

376
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,050
perhaps a ballad? That would be an 

377
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,350
example of a lyric, 

378
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,950
if it's a novel, 

379
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,050
of course you should mention all of that 

380
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,210
in this introductory one 

381
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,810
or two or three sentences. 

382
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,450
As an aside, I 

383
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,450
recently 

384
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,810
spoke to a German teacher who also thinks 

385
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,990
it's a total bad habit to 

386
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,910
teach students 

387
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,870
that the introduction to a 

388
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,850
text has to be in one sentence. 

389
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,210
He thinks it's terrible and 

390
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,330
so do I , by the way - it doesn't have to 

391
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,150
happen. You don't have to 

392
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,390

393
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,410
string all this information together in 
one sentence like a robot. 

394
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,510
You can also 

395
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,130

396
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,190
make two sentences or my God, maybe even 
three sentences . 

397
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,750
Nobody will actually tear your head off. 

398
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,350
On the contrary, it's actually much, much 

399
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,470
easier. So remember, 

400
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,970
you don't have to fit all this information 
into 

401
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,070
one long sentence. 

402
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,970
It's better to write two or even 

403
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,510
three sentences. Of course, you should 
also 

404
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,930
indicate when the text was written 

405
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,350
. This is important because 

406
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,350
the year of publication also 

407
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,750
says a lot about the content, if 

408
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,370
it is known at all. 

409
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,790
So perhaps it is already written here, if 

410
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,090
possible, so you should also 

411
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,350

412
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,770
be able to assign it to the era or age. 
For example, if you 

413
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,570
're in the LK , I can't 

414
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,030
remember which of you two or whether 

415
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,730
you were both in the LK. If you 

416
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,270
can then assign the era, for example, 

417
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,870
I don't know, then, this is a 

418
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,870
text, blah blah blah, that can be 

419
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,170
assigned to the Sturm und Drang 

420
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,210
, for example. You should 

421
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,390
mention that if you know that, 

422
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,150
if you know the date. And then, 

423
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,750
what is this text about? 

424
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,570
Topic or problem, but this 

425
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,850
does not mean that the synopsis begins 
here 

426
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,230
, but rather that 

427
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,130
one or at most two 

428
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,810
sentences are sufficient , here it really 
is the case, one 

429
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,690
or two sentences that really 

430
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,470
roughly outline the topic so that the 

431
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,490
reader immediately knows what 

432
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,570
this text is about . The synopsis, the 

433
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,770
main part of it, then follows. 

434
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,550
Main part. Here, of course, you can 

435
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,810
again differentiate between which 

436
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,670
text category I come from. 

437
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,670
Do I come from a non-fictional text or 

438
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,190
a fictional text? 

439
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,710
Do I come from drama, poetry or 

440
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,990
epic? Depending on what I 

441
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,870
have here. Here is an 

442
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,030
example of a fictional text. How 

443
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,770
should the main body 

444
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,330
be structured for fictional texts? 

445
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,070
Of course, I have to address the 
characters 

446
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,910
involved . Who are the characters 

447
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,290
? Where does the whole thing take place? 
In 

448
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,990
what time? Perhaps also what 

449
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,710
time period? All of this has to 

450
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,470
be specified , of course. And then comes 

451
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,670
the summary of the most important 

452
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,150
events. This can be in chronological 

453
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,410
order, but should not 

454
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,790
have any time jumps or flashbacks. In 

455
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,330
chronological order makes 

456
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,830
perfect sense for fictional texts, 

457
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,490
as these are narrative texts. 

458
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,630
With non-fiction texts, you can 

459
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,550
deviate from 

460
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,170
going through the text chronologically . 
In this case, it 

461
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,990
may simply make sense to 

462
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,630
go through different positions 

463
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,810
or perhaps also different 

464
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,590
scientific aspects 

465
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,330
that you 

466
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,890
have summarized . You can also 

467
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,710

468
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,290
deviate from this chronological logical 
sequence. 

469
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,570
But with fictional texts , i.e. 

470
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,250
narrative texts, you should stick to 

471
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,870
it . 

472
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,870
Take the example of a non-fiction text. 

473
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,570
Of course, you should provide a certain 
number of 

474
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,170
meaningful sections. That's 

475
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,010
what I just meant. Maybe 

476
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,550
this text is about 

477
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,910
a certain topic, 

478
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,490
illuminated from different angles. You 

479
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,190
simply make meaningful sections out of it 

480
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,950
and think about what 

481
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,250
the first, second, third 

482
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,870
section is about, what are the most 
important 

483
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,730
details, exactly which 

484
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,290
sections, 

485
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,850
summarize further sections , the 
conclusion, the, ah 

486
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,110
yes, have you then 

487
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,630
put the sections together, have you 

488
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,750
already described the sections , what are 
the 

489
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,290
most important aspects, could you 

490
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,150
perhaps notice that there 

491
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,550
is something coherent, 

492
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,730
something that 

493
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,570
overlays the whole thing, so to speak , 
then 

494
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,330
of course you could also 

495
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,330

496
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,110
write a conclusion, a so-called final 
sentence or a conclusion. But you'll 
notice, 

497
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,790
whether you're using a non-fiction text or 

498
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,170
a fictional text, that 

499
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,810
careful planning is the be-all 

500
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,170
and end-all. So many students, many 
students 

501
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,370

502
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,770
still don't have the confidence , 
especially for an 

503
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,210
exam like this , which can easily take two 
or 

504
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,110
three hours. So you want to 

505
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,350
ask briefly, what is the 

506
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,310
current status of German lessons? 

507
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,970
Advanced course exams, preliminary exams 

508
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,010
, for example. How long are they? 

509
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,210
Ms. Schönweiß. 

510
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,870
Ah yes. Well, you write for four to 

511
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,430
five hours. That means you have 

512
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,870
plenty of time, even if, 

513
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,890

514
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,230
as I said, many students don't quite have 
the confidence to 

515
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,210

516
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,830

517
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,450
take apart a text in front of you to the 
best of their knowledge and belief . In 
other words, you 

518
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,690
can smear it with colors and 

519
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,610
marginal notes and 

520
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,090
integrate and circle sections of meaning. 
And then 

521
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,070
you can take a so-called 

522
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,650
concept paper. You 

523
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,810
simply take a blank piece of paper, which 

524
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,770
you are also allowed to do in the exam, in 

525
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,450
which you already 

526
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,690
plan a rough outline , so to speak. What 
should the 

527
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,270
summary look like from your point of view 

528
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,070
? 

529
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,550
And what 

530
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,970
is important to include in 

531
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,550
bullet points, of course, so that you 

532
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,090
only 

533
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,150

534
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,390
have to keep an eye on this concept paper 
from time to time as you write. And then 

535
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,890
you won't get lost. 

536
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,390
I find it very difficult and 

537
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,690
actually impossible to write a 

538
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,490
synopsis without a 

539
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,330
concept paper . You get 

540
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,550
lost in between, you 

541
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,150
digress, you lose the 

542
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,250
thread, it's no longer really 

543
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,690
legible. And by that I don't mean 

544
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,910
the legibility of the writing, but 

545
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,390
you simply don't somehow understand 

546
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,390
the thread you 

547
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,490
've been following. So my appeal to you is 
to 

548
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,170
take it easy. 

549
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,610

550
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,830
When I was writing my exams , I sometimes 

551
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,730
didn't write anything for 20 to 30 minutes 
for 

552
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,030
the synopsis, I just 

553
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,970
sorted it, divided it into sections, 

554
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,830
created a concept paper and outline 

555
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,170
and only then started 

556
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,450
writing. You have to dare to do that, 

557
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,530
it was 

558
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,950
difficult for me at the beginning too , 
but it's worth it. 

559
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,310
It's really worth it, because 

560
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,550
once you 

561
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,710
've written a concept paper like this , 
you write from A 

562
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,330
to Z once and 

563
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,810
don't have any problems getting 

564
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,370
lost in between. A big tip from me. 

565
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,050
So, finally we come to a 

566
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,890
small checklist. So, have I 

567
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,310
used the contra quals throughout 

568
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,730
? Have I 

569
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,650

570
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,370
converted direct speech into indirect 
speech , if at all necessary ? Have 

571
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,730
I, very importantly, used my own 

572
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,850
formulations? Or am 

573
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,490
I perhaps still too close to the text 

574
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,990
? Have I written factually? 

575
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,210
Not that I 

576
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,570

577
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,470
have used any embellishing adjectives that 
I 

578
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,410
would have to delete immediately. Have I 
limited myself to essential 

579
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,510
aspects or 

580
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,810
am I perhaps even repeating myself 
somewhere 

581
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,250

582
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,590
that could perhaps be summarized again? 
Have I 

583
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,930
hopefully not 

584
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,050

585
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,490
written any evaluations, interpretations 
or comments , but have I really only 

586
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,270
given a factual account of what 

587
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,370
appears in the text? Have I 

588
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,870
included everything important about the 
text in my 

589
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,790
evaluation? Introduction, have I 

590
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,730
perhaps 

591
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,130
forgotten the year of publication , which 
can happen in the heat 

592
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,370
of the moment, have I 

593
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,810
kept to the correct order for 

594
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,330
fictional texts or is my 

595
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,790
division into meaningful sections good, 

596
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,450
logical, sensible, if I am 

597
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,910
analyzing non-fiction texts, do I 

598
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,970
perhaps have a summarizing 

599
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,930
final sentence and so on. 

600
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,970
You can keep that roughly in 

601
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,370
mind as a checklist , then you can 

602
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,610
't really 

603
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,370
do too much wrong. So, my dears, 

604
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,630
that's actually all you need to 

605
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,450
know about the synopsis. 

606
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,050
It may seem very 

607
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,010
short to you , because this summary 
usually 

608
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,710

609
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,930
corresponds to requirement area 1 in an 
exam. 

610
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,790
That's probably why 

611
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,770
not so much attention is paid to it 

612
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,370
. But you should, because with 

613
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,930
a good summary, you are 

614
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,070
also well prepared for 

615
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,570
further tasks, 

616
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,890
such as standard 

617
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,330
analysis tasks, where you 

618
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,510
are also supposed to analyze the text. 
Many people make 

619
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,970
the mistake, especially when they 

620
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,350
read I am analyzing the text, of 

621
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,070
only writing a summary 

622
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,030
and not really 

623
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,330
analyzing it. In other words, a summary as 

624
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,330
opposed to a text analysis. 

625
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,550
A summary really only gives 

626
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,450
a factual account of the text. 

627
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,650
We have 

628
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,710
just discussed the criteria for this. And 

629
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,790
when it comes to text analysis, I have to 

630
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,070
look deeper. 

631
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,570
The main question is, what did the 

632
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,270
author of the text 

633
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,110
actually want to convey to me as the 
reader ? That's the 

634
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,090
rough distinction. If you 

635
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,010
have any questions for Katrin 

636
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,730
and Annika, please feel free to ask them 

637
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,730
now. 

638
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,170
Your heads are spinning. Did I 

639
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,570
perhaps understand something ? Uh, not 

640
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,070
understood, sorry. Otherwise, 

641
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,130
you can give me a short 

642
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,010
feedback now . 

643
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,260
great, 

644
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,490
great, thank you, that makes me happy. 

645
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,950
Then, if there are no more questions 

646
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,510
and you 

647
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,970
're totally happy with it , have a nice 

648
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,110
evening tonight. 

649
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,030
I don't need to 

650
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,310
repeat the appeal right now , I've already 

651
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,890
done that, you've noticed. Stay 

652
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,750
at home, enjoy the time that 

653
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,030
you can stay at home. 

654
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,910
You're really doing everyone 

655
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,570
a big favor. Okay, 

656
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,610
great. Have a nice evening 

657
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,090
. Bye.
