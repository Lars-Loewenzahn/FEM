1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,920
... with the topic of whole numbers. I 

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,660
hope you can all see and 

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,840
hear me. Then please send me a quick 

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,740
message in the chat. 

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,830
Wonderful. So, as I said, our 

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,650
topic today is integers. 

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,010
Let's start by looking at the 

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,470
basics. How do we represent them 

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,550
? How do we compare them? How do 

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,270
we order them? Then we'll look at 

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,810
how we add and 

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,150
subtract whole numbers , how we 

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,310
multiply and divide them and 

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,770
finally how we 

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,250
deal with whole numbers in brackets. So, 
what are integers 

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,650
anyway? 

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,870
We abbreviate the set of integers with the 

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,510
symbol z, i.e. a z with two 

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,630
dashes. The set z describes all 

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,030
positive and negative 

21
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,630
integers known to us. So the set of all 

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,550
negative and positive integers 

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,010
, for example minus 8, minus 

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,710
7, minus 6, minus 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 

25
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,570
all belong to the set of integers 

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,710
. The 0 is 

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,610
always automatically included. 

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,940
The set of integers 

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,040
looks like this on the number line. We 

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,900
have the zero. 

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,220
The negative 

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,480
numbers start on the left-hand side . The 

33
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,800
positive numbers are on the right-hand 
side . 

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,380
We can also 

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,020
represent the sets of numbers very well as 
circles . For example, we have 

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,560
our positive numbers, the set n. 

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,020
Then the set n with zero. That 

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,080
includes the zero. Just like 

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,540
this whole circle. and the integers 

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,240
, which also include the negative 

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,900
numbers. 

42
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,120
So we see that n and n0 are parts of z. 
They 

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,220
are contained in z. 

44
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,640
The further to the left a number 

45
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,440
is on the number line, the smaller 

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,920
it is. The further to the right a number 

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,980
is on the number line, the larger 

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,880
it is. For example, minus 4 is 

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,800
further to the left of 1. Minus 4 is 
therefore 

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,640
smaller than 1. Minus 4 is here, 1 

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,540
is here, minus 4 is further to the left. 

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,660
So we write, minus 4 is 

53
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,160
less than, that is the sign for 

54
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,400
less than, 1. 3 is further to 

55
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,500
the right than 0. 3 is therefore greater 
than 

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,000
0. We write 3 is greater than 0. 

57
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,360

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,340
We can arrange the numbers, the whole 
numbers, according to their size. 

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,900
So we can write minus 6 is 

60
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,840
smaller than minus 5, is smaller than 

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,460
minus 4, is smaller than minus 3 and 

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,860
so on, is smaller than 4, is 

63
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,000
smaller than 5, is smaller than 6. 

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,200
So, for example, if we 

65
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,360

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,020
order 3, 5, 11, minus 11, 0, 7 and minus 8 
by size , we start with the smallest 

67
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,700
number on the left, minus 11, is smaller 

68
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,580
than minus 8, is smaller than 0, is 

69
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,440
smaller than 3, is smaller than 5. is 

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,620
smaller than 7 and is smaller than 11. 

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,340
So 

72
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,660
ordered from the smallest to the largest 
number. 

73
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,310
In these example problems, we have to 

74
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,490
use the less than, greater than or 

75
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,350
equal sign. 

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,620
Which sign do we use in 

77
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,040
the first task? 

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,380
If you 

79
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,720
are looking for the less than and greater 
than signs on your keyboard, they 

80
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,520
are at the bottom left. Right next to the 
y. 

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,420
Yes, 

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,980
exactly. 

83
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,620
So, Robin's answer is correct, 

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,220
Sophie's answer is unfortunately wrong, 

85
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,060
because 10 is greater than minus 2. We'll 

86
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,400
try again with the 

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,080
next one. Minus 1 and 5. 

88
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,030
Do we need the greater than, the 

89
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,390
less than or the 

90
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,390
equals sign here ? 

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,180
No problem. So, 

92
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,140
which sign do we need for the 

93
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,240
second task? Exactly. And for the 

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,680
third? Minus 2 and 2, 

95
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,580
very nice. For minus 11 and minus 

96
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,620
11. For 

97
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
minus 9 and minus 13. 

98
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,050
Exactly. And finally minus 22 and 0. 

99
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,470
Very nice. Take a look. Once again in 

100
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,930
the solution. 10 is greater than minus 

101
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,190
2. 2 minus 1 is less than 5, minus 

102
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,510
2 is less than 2, minus 11 is 

103
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,950
equal to minus 11, minus 9 is greater 

104
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,070
than minus 13 and minus 22 is less 

105
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,330
than 0. Very good. 

106
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,860
Now let's 

107
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,740
add and subtract whole numbers. 

108
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,360
When adding and subtracting with whole 

109
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,520
numbers, it is important to 

110
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,120
pay attention to the signs. Because if 

111
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
we 

112
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,760
add a positive number and a positive 
number, it remains a 

113
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,700
plus. If we 

114
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,700
subtract a negative number, it 

115
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,400
becomes minus. If we 

116
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,230
subtract a positive number, plus becomes 

117
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,330
minus and if we 

118
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,770
subtract a negative number, it becomes 
plus. 

119
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,570
We'll take a look at this in 

120
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,630
tasks in a moment , as it's easier to 

121
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,190
understand. Basically 

122
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,290
, however, we can remember 

123
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,590
that when we have positive numbers, 
addition and 

124
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,170
subtraction remain as we 

125
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,410
have learned them. With negative numbers, 

126
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,250
addition becomes subtraction and 

127
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,370
vice versa. For example. We look 

128
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,050
at the signs. When 

129
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,190
negative numbers 

130
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,250
are added or subtracted, addition 

131
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,670
and subtraction are reversed. We have 

132
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,210
15 plus plus 30. 

133
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,110
Nothing changes here. 15 plus minus 30. 
Here we have 

134
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,490
a negative number. This means 

135
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,710
that the addition becomes a subtraction. 

136
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,410
So we calculate 15 minus 30. minus 

137
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,550
15 plus plus 30. Again, 

138
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,050
nothing changes because we have the 

139
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,930
positive number. So we calculate 

140
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,650
minus 15 plus 30. minus 15 plus minus 

141
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,930
30. Here the plus changes back 

142
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,370
to a minus, so minus 15 

143
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:07,010
minus 30. 15 minus plus 30, we have 

144
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,650
a positive number, which means it 

145
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,930
remains a minus. 15 minus minus 30, 

146
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,970
the minus becomes a plus, 

147
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,530
so 

148
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,290

149
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,030
we calculate 15 plus 30. Minus 15 minus 
plus 30, nothing changes here, we 
calculate minus. Minus 15 minus 30 and 

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,510
minus 15 minus minus 30, here 

151
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,210
the minus becomes a plus. So we calculate 

152
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,550
minus 15 plus 30. 

153
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,760
Here we can see the 

154
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,880
change again. The minus before the 

155
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,720
30 changes the sign. 

156
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,500
So we calculate minus 30, here minus 30. 

157
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,920
Here we have minus minus, 

158
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,040
so we calculate plus. and here we 

159
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,160
also have minus minus and calculate 

160
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,680
plus. Now we can 

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,460
work out the problems as normal. 

162
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,240
15 plus 30 is 45, 15 minus 30 is 

163
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,400
minus 15, minus 15 plus 30 is 15, 

164
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,560
minus 15 minus 30 is minus 45, 15 

165
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,100
minus 30 is minus 15, 15 plus 30 is 

166
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,340
45, minus 15 minus 30 is minus 45 

167
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,360
and minus 15 plus 30 is 15. What 

168
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,460
about multiplication and 

169
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,300
division? 

170
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,640
The following 

171
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,600
rules apply to the signs in multiplication 
. If we 

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,180

173
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,020
multiply a negative number by a negative 
number , we get a 

174
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,720
positive number. If 

175
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,700
we multiply two positive numbers together, 

176
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,440
we also get a positive 

177
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,460
number. If we 

178
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,380
multiply a negative and a positive number, 
we get 

179
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,860
a negative number. 

180
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,080
So, if both factors are the same 

181
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,420
, whether positive or negative, 

182
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,740
the product is always positive. 

183
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,360
If both factors are different, 

184
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,460
the product is always negative. 

185
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,120
The same rules apply to 

186
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,620
division. Negative divided by negative 

187
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,840
gives positive. Positive divided by 
positive 

188
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,220
equals positive. Negative divided by 
positive 

189
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,920
equals negative. And positive divided by 

190
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,120
negative equals negative. So, if 

191
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,660
both... Equal positive, if the 

192
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,060
two are different, negative. 

193
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,960
Let's look at this again with 

194
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,500
example problems. We have 5 times 

195
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,580
3, two positive numbers. This means that 

196
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,440
our result will be positive. With 

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,460
5 times minus 3, we have one positive 

198
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,820
and one negative number. 

199
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,860
So we have a negative result. The same 
applies 

200
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,020
to minus 5 times 3. If we have minus 5 
times 

201
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,260
minus 3, we have two negative 

202
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,560
numbers. Our result is therefore 

203
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,360
positive. If we divide 20 by 5, we divide 

204
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,220
a positive number by another 

205
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,420
positive number. Our result will 

206
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,560
therefore be positive. If we divide 20 by 
minus 

207
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,240
5, we have a positive number 

208
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
divided by a negative number 

209
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
. Therefore, our result is 

210
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
negative, just like with minus 20 

211
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,640
by 5. With minus 20 by minus 5, 

212
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,100
we divide a negative number by 

213
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,300
another negative number. Therefore, 

214
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,500
the result is positive. Here we see 

215
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,900
it again. And 

216
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,550
we see two positive numbers, our 

217
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,010
result is positive. Here in the 

218
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,990
tasks, the factors are 

219
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,470
different, which means we have 

220
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,770
negative results. If we have two 

221
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,350
negative numbers, we have a 

222
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,050
positive result again and the same applies 

223
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,270
to division. 

224
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,410
How do we now calculate with whole 

225
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,610
numbers in brackets? 

226
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,930

227
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,790
We have to 

228
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,810
pay attention to the signs for expressions 
in brackets, addition and subtraction . If 
we are dealing with 

229
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,010
long parenthesis terms, 

230
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,490
it is important that we 

231
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,450
resolve the parentheses first. Remember, 

232
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,970
if we 

233
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,150
have a plus in front of the parenthesis , 
we can usually 

234
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,010
just leave the parentheses out. 

235
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,750
However, if we have a minus sign in front 
of the parenthesis 

236
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,430
, we have to reverse all the signs 

237
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,610
inside the parenthesis 

238
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,230
if we want to dissolve the parenthesis. 

239
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,830
For example, 5 plus 3 minus in 

240
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,990
brackets 8 plus 2 plus in brackets 4 

241
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,270
minus 9. If we now 

242
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,010
break up the brackets , we 

243
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,250
have a minus sign in front of the bracket. 

244
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,450
This means that we have to turn the 

245
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,510
sign inside the bracket 

246
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,590
from minus to plus. Here we have 

247
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,290
a plus in front of the bracket, which 
means that 

248
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,750
the 

249
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,070
sign remains as it is for 4 minus 9. 

250
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,390
So we write 5 plus 3 minus 8 minus 

251
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:04,190
2 plus 4 minus 9 equals minus 7. 

252
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,510
Alternatively, we can also 

253
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,730
calculate the contents of the parentheses 
first. So we 

254
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,350
work out the parenthesis, 8 plus 2 is 

255
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,570
10. We work out this parenthesis, 4 

256
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,590
minus 9 is minus 5 and 

257
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,350
then write 5 plus 3 minus 10 plus minus 5. 

258
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,230
Here we know that plus minus 5 

259
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,350
becomes minus 5, so 5 plus 3 minus 10 

260
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,010
minus 

261
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,100
For multiplication and division, 

262
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,260
we must first 

263
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,880
calculate the contents of the parentheses 
. Then we can 

264
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,600
use the rules for multiplication 

265
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
and division as normal. 

266
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,300
For example, we have 4 times 2 minus 7 in 

267
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,880
brackets minus 5 minus 3 in brackets 

268
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,740
times 6. We calculate the first bracket 

269
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,800
, minus 5, the second bracket, 

270
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,460
2. Then we calculate the task 

271
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,040
again. 4 times minus 5, minus 2 times 

272
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,320
6, pay attention to point-before-dash 

273
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 calculation. 4 times minus 5 is minus 

274
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,080
20, 2 times 6 is 12. So we calculate 

275
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,860
minus 20, minus 12. equals minus 32. 

276
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,960
The same goes for these brackets. We 

277
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,680
have 4 times 6 in brackets through 3 

278
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,380
minus 12 through 1 minus 5 in brackets 

279
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,160
. We first calculate the brackets 

280
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,380
. 4 times 6 is 24, 1 minus 5 is 

281
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,550
minus 4, then 

282
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,290
carry out the dot-before-dash calculation. 
24 divided by 3 

283
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,850
is 8. 12 divided by minus 4, here 

284
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,730
again we have a positive and a 

285
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,750
negative number, equals minus 3. And 8 

286
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,790
minus minus 3 is the same as 8 plus 

287
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,810
3, equals 11. 

288
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,970
That brings us to the end of 

289
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,370
our webinar. Do you have 

290
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,730
any questions? 

291
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,140
Very well. Then thank you for 

292
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,920
your attention and 

293
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,820
have a nice evening. 

294
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,030
Thank you very much.
