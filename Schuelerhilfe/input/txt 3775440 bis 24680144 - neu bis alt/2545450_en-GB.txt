00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,360
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,720
Schülerhilfe webinar on the topic of 

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,120
connecting basic arithmetic operations. 

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,900
Today we are going to 

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,920

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,860
look at some arithmetic rules relating to 
brackets and dot-before-dash arithmetic. 
First, 

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,520
we'll start with the parentheses 

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,740
first rule. Then we will look 

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,340
at what dot-before-dash actually 

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,680
means. We'll look at 

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,480
the order in which brackets and the 
dot-before-dash 

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,320
rule are used. 

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,300

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,140
We'll look at the in which 

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,960
parentheses and dot-before-dash 
calculations must be considered in a 
calculation and how we can calculate with 
parentheses. 

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,380
Let's start with the rule: brackets 

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,520
always come first. We remember that if 

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,120
a calculation 

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,100
contains one or more brackets 

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,820
, the content of these brackets is always 

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,640
calculated first. We have 

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,160
written down an example of this. We have 

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,900
the calculation 3, 3 times in brackets 4 

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,280
minus 2 plus 3 minus in brackets 8 

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,400
minus 6 times 2. The first thing 

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,700
we do is work out the brackets. 

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,500
This means that we calculate 4 minus 2 
equals 2 

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,780
and 8 minus 6 equals 2. Only then do 

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,400
we 

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,580
apply the other calculation rules. If 

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,250
we 

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,790
have several brackets inside each other in 
a calculation, we calculate from the 

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,570
inside out. So 3 times square 

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,770
brackets open, round brackets open, 4 

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,450
minus 2, round brackets closed, plus 3 

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,470
square brackets closed, minus round 

37
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,910
brackets open, 8 minus 6, round brackets 

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,670
closed, times 2. So we first calculate 

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,610
what is in the inner bracket. 4 

40
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,510
minus 2 is 2. Then we can 

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,270
work out the square bracket. 2 plus 3 

42
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,240
is 5. If there is only one 

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,020
round bracket, we only need to 

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,580
work out the round bracket. 

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,400
There are no more brackets inside. So 8 

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
minus 6 equals 2. Then we can 

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,540
calculate again. What 

48
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,570
does dot before dash mean? 

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,830
Again, we remember when a calculation 

50
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,710
has no brackets or no more brackets 

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,930
, but it consists of multiplication 

52
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,670
and or division as well as addition and 

53
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,530
or subtraction. In other words, 

54
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,870

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,530
the rule point before 

56
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,950
dash applies to both multiplication and 
division as well as addition and 
subtraction . Dot before dash means 

57
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,450
that we 

58
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,710

59
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,070

60
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,410
do the dot calculations, i.e. times and 
divided, before the dash calculations, 
i.e. minus and plus. This depends on the 

61
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,330
appearance of the characters. Times and 

62
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,850
divided are made up of dots, 

63
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,530
plus and minus are made up of dashes 

64
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,290
. That's why we say dot before 

65
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,650
dash. In other words, we have 

66
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,970
given another example. 5 times 3 

67
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,710
minus 9 plus 2 minus 9 divided by 

68
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,470
3 plus 6 times 2. We have no 

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,970
brackets, so we apply the dot 

70
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,750
 before dash rule. This means that we 

71
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,810
first calculate 5 times 3, 9 divided 

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,310
by 3 and 6 times 2. 

73
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,950
Once we have calculated this , we can then 

74
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,150

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,730
calculate plus and minus from left to 
right. 

76
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,310
If we 

77
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,090

78
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,670

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,550
have brackets and multiplications or 
divisions as well as additions or 
subtractions , we first calculate the 

80
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,090
brackets, then we calculate the dot 

81
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,550
before the dash. Because when we 

82
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,650
calculate the brackets 

83
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,110
, we only have the dot before 

84
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,510
dash operation left. We no 

85
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,410
longer have any brackets 

86
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,110
in our calculation. We have already 

87
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,690
calculated them. 

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,840
How do we calculate with brackets? Let's 

89
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,460
take a look at the example problems. 

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,460
We have 3 times in brackets 4 minus 2 

91
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,080
plus 3 minus in brackets 8 minus 6 

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,380
times 2. First we calculate the 

93
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,760
brackets. 4 minus 2 equals 2. 8 minus 

94
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,480
6 also equals 2. Now that we 

95
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,740

96
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,600
have no more brackets in our calculation, 
we apply the 

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,320
 dot-before-dash rule. 

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,040
So we calculate 3 times 2 equals 6 and 2 
times 2 

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,920
equals 4. Then we carry out the 

100
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,520
other arithmetic operations, 

101
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,140
i.e. addition and subtraction. 6 plus 

102
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,940
3 equals 9, minus 4 equals 5. 5 is 

103
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,240
therefore the result of our calculation. 

104
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,830
Another example with brackets 

105
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,790
within brackets. 3 times square 

106
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,410
brackets, then in brackets 4 minus 2 

107
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,910
plus 3, square brackets closed, 

108
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,050
minus in brackets 8 minus 6 times 2. 

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,630
Again, we first calculate the 

110
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,970
round bracket inside the square 

111
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,070
bracket. 4 minus 2 equals 2. 

112
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,650
We can 

113
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,150
also calculate the round bracket outside 
immediately. 8 minus 6 

114
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,370
is also 2. Next, 

115
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,110
we calculate the square bracket. 2 

116
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,010
plus 3 equals 5. Now we have no 

117
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,350
more brackets in our calculation. 

118
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,450
We can therefore multiply. 3 times 

119
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,810
5 equals 15 and 2 times 2 equals 4. This 

120
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,030
means that 15 minus 4 is 11 and 11 is 

121
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,270
the result of our calculation. 

122
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,270
What happens if we 

123
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,550

124
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,170
have dot arithmetic within brackets ? In 
this case, we 

125
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,830

126
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,370
first carry out the dot-before-dash 
calculation within the brackets, but only 

127
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,830
within the bracket. In 

128
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,050
our task, this means 7 times square 
brackets 

129
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,710
to 5 plus inside brackets 3 times 3 minus 

130
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,450
4 minus 2 square brackets to minus 15 

131
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,270
times 2. We first calculate the 

132
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,810
dot-before-dash calculation 

133
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,990
inside the inner bracket. So 3 times 3 is 

134
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,050
9. Now we can 

135
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,910
calculate the inner bracket. 9 minus 4 
equals 

136
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,390
5. Now we can calculate the outer 

137
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,810
bracket. 5 plus 5 equals 

138
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,450
10. minus 2 equals 8. We have now 

139
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,690
calculated all the brackets and 

140
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,490
we apply the dot-before-dash rule 

141
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,910
to the entire calculation. 7 times 8 

142
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,450
equals 56, 15 times 2 equals 30. Now 

143
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,530
we only have to 

144
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,910
carry out the remaining arithmetic 
operations. So 

145
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,690
56 minus 30 equals 26. Let's 

146
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,190
summarize the whole thing again. 

147
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,810
Remember, we 

148
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,850
always calculate brackets first. If there 
are several 

149
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,770
brackets, we calculate from the inside to 
the 

150
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,150
outside. So first the inner bracket, 

151
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,710
then the outer bracket. 

152
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,830
We also note that the 

153
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,590
dot-before-dash rule applies to brackets . 
And once we 

154
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,510
have calculated all the brackets, 

155
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,970
the dot-before-dash rule applies 

156
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,490
to the rest of the calculation. And that 
brings us to 

157
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,830
the end of 

158
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,830
today's webinar. 

159
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,450
Thank you for your attention 

160
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,210
and have a nice day.
