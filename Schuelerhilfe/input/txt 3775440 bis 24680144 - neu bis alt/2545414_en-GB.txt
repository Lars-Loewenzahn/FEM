00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,280
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,160
Linear Equation Systems 1. 

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,140
First of all, I hope you 

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,840
can hear me. If so, 

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,640
please write a short yes or okay in 

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,780
the chat at the bottom right, just 

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,980
so I know that you 

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,880
can hear me and that we 

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,320
can start the webinar as usual. 

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,080
Okay, you can hear me, that's 

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,120
wonderful. We're going to start 

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,400
the webinar right now . If you have 

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,980
a question about anything, 

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,620
just ask it directly in 

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,860
the bottom right of the chat that you just 
used 

16
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,800
and I'll 

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,980
get back to you right away. 

18
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,040
However, I think that we will still 

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,700
have enough time for a 

20
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
short Q&A session at the end of the 
webinar . 

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,660
This means that questions 

22
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,080
can be clarified there again if 

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,940
there are any left unanswered. Well, here 
is 

24
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,020
a very brief 

25
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,500
outline of today's webinar. 

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,260
As you can see, we will 

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,940
only be 

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,420
looking at three solution methods for the 
time being. These three are the 

29
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,640
substitution method, the 

30
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,900
equation method and the 

31
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,420
addition method. Of course, 

32
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,160
we will first acquire some 

33
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,340
basic knowledge so that we 

34
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,620
understand each other. And we will first 
look at 

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,860
what a 

36
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,200
system of linear equations actually is and 
what 

37
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,440
the difference is between it and a 

38
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,200
normal linear equation or 

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,100
an equation has. has. At the very 

40
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,680
end, we'll briefly 

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,980
look at factual problems, which we' 

42
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,020
ll also calculate, and the graphical 

43
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,940
meaning of how to visualize this 
graphically 

44
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,760
. Right, so I'd like to 

45
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,020
start directly with the 

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,540
properties. What is 

47
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,600
a system of linear 

48
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,200
equations? 

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
First of all, every system of equations 
consists of 

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,120
more than one variable, or in this case 

51
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,660
there are exactly two, as you 

52
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,080
can see. These variables should 

53
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,120
of course 

54
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,420
have different letters. So in our case, 
the X is 

55
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,700
the Y. And our system of equations 

56
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,360
always has vertical lines on the right 

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,760
and left. This is simply 

58
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,540
done so that you know exactly where 

59
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,420
the system of equations begins and where 

60
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,920
it ends. Because you will see below 

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,820
that we will of course 

62
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,440

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,260
have to work on the system of equations in 
some way in order to solve it. 

64
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,320
And so we will 

65
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,620
write it down more often and 

66
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,400

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,860

68
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,760
vertical lines will be drawn so that it is 
always very clear where the individual 
system of equations begins and where it 
ends. 

69
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,860
What is also very 

70
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,760
important with systems of equations is the 
following. 

71
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,780
In order to 

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,740

73
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,520
be able to solve a system of equations 
unambiguously, which is very important, 
just as 

74
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
many equations as variables are 

75
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,840
required . In concrete terms, this means 
that 

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,800
we have two variables, x and 

77
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,040
y. And in order to solve the system of 
equations 

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
uniquely, we must also 

79
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,780
have two equations. And as you can see 

80
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,160
, we do, which means 

81
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,740

82
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,540
we can solve this system of equations . 
And that' 

83
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,860
s what we do. What you have just seen 

84
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,160
is the system of equations 

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,460
that we 

86
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,980
will use for the first solution method, 

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,040
which is the substitution method. The 

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,620
name actually says everything about 

89
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,480
the method, as you'll 

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,360
see in a moment. The aim of the 

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,500
substitution method is actually 

92
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
just to 

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,540

94
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,160
rearrange one of the two equations - it 
doesn't matter whether we rearrange the 
upper or the lower equation - so 

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,060
that it becomes a variable 

96
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,440
and then substitutes it into the other 

97
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,040
equation. Conveniently 

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,780
, we already have the second 

99
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,940
equation here , which is called y is 
equal, 

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,580
i.e. it has already been 

101
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,200
converted to one of the two variables, in 
this 

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,860
case y. This means we don't need to 

103
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,840
convert any further, we can 

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,060
simply 

105
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,600
take this equation and substitute 3x 

106
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,400
-11 for the y , as you will see. And 
that's 

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,500
the substitution step, which is why 

108
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,520
the substitution method is called what 

109
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,980
it is. Well, let's do the whole thing 

110
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,060
step by step. As 

111
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,540
I just said, we have the 

112
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,260
advantage that one equation has already 
been 

113
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,940
rearranged according to y. This is the 

114
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,060
lower one. This means that we save 
ourselves the 

115
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,840
first step, so to speak. That would be to 

116
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,860

117
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,380
convert one of the two equations to y. We 
have. We 

118
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,440
know that y corresponds to 3x-11. 11 and 

119
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,260
we now use this 3x minus 11 

120
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,380
for the y in the other equation 

121
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,400
, which means that 

122
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,480
where there is a y here, there is 3x 

123
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,920
minus 11, which I 

124
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,280
can only advise you to do is 

125
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,620
to always put this term in brackets first 

126
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,560
, otherwise you will quickly have a 

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,680
sign error, which we will 

128
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,660
see in the next step, 

129
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,880
as you can see, we will bracket it out, 
which 

130
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
means that we have 9x minus 

131
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,880
3x, i.e. 9x minus 3x and 9x 

132
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,420
minus minus 11. That's 

133
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,100
plus 11. And that's very important. 

134
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,680
You have to be careful and, as I said, 

135
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,720
I would always advocate 

136
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,060
putting a bracket first, 

137
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,520
even if you 

138
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,400
have to take one more step. As you can 
see, 

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
we' 

140
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,120
re not going to do anything to the 
equation below. 

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,840
For now, we'll only calculate 

142
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,480
in the upper equation after substituting . 
And you can 

143
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,360
already see that after substituting 

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,660
, we only have one equation 

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,980
that is dependent on x, 

146
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,000
or on one variable. 

147
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,380
And that's the trick behind this 

148
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,240
substitution method. By 

149
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,640
substituting, we have 

150
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,900
obtained a completely normal equation that 
we 

151
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,480

152
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,900
can easily solve using the methods we 
know. 9x minus 3x plus 11 

153
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,700
equals 41. We simply solve that. 9x 

154
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,560
minus 3x equals 6x and we now know that 

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,540
6x plus 11 equals 41. Then 

156
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,680
we bring the 11 over, i.e. we 

157
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,760
calculate minus 11. Then we arrive at 

158
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,180
6x equals 30. Now there is just 

159
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,060
the familiar last step. 

160
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,800
We divide by the factor in front of the 

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,220
variable, which in this case is a 

162
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,760
6. That means we divide 30 by 6, 

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,420
which is 5. And now we know that x 

164
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,940
equals 5. There is 

165
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,340
a small formatting problem here. 

166
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,160
Of course, there should also be a vertical 

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,000
black line here. These 

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
vertical lines that we just 

169
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,920
saw at the beginning. And with that, 

170
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,260
you've actually already 

171
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,920
done all the work. Because the 

172
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,400
only thing left to do is a very simple 

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,080
step. We now know the value 

174
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,500
for the x and of course we 

175
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,480
also have to specify the solution set, 
i.e. 

176
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,080
the value for the y. And 

177
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,960
we can calculate this quite simply using 
the 

178
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,100
substitution method by substituting the 

179
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,960
value for the x. We that is . We know 

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
that y is equal to 3x-11, which in 

181
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,340
our case means that y is equal to 3 times 
5 

182
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,500
minus 11. 3 times 5 is 15 and 15 minus 

183
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,380
11 is 4. And that is the 

184
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,560
last step. We say x is 

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,120
equal to 5, we already know that, y 

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,200
is equal to 4, and 

187
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,320
then we enter the whole thing as the 
solution set, and then 

188
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,220
this system of equations is solved. 

189
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,400
Do you have a question up to this point? 
Was 

190
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,420
that all clear? 

191
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,970
Okay, great. Well, as I said, that 

192
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,870
was the 

193
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,910
complete application 

194
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,590
of the method once. It follows 

195
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,310
this pattern every time. 

196
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,290
As the webinar says, we are 

197
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,750
dealing with linear systems of equations. 

198
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,050
This means that there are always two 

199
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,030
equations. Here, the 

200
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,570
substitution method is the 

201
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,230
method that 

202
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,710
is used the most. It's actually very 

203
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,690
quick and it's not 

204
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,290
quite as complex as the others 

205
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,550
. So the 

206
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,570
substitution method is a 

207
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,510
method that allows you to find a 

208
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,370
solution very quickly. Of course, 

209
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
we will also look at the 

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,180
other two. This is the 

211
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,480
equating method. 

212
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,520
Like 

213
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,220
the substitution method , the equation 
method can only be 

214
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,840
used for linear equations. And 

215
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,900
we'll take a look at that. 

216
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,980
To begin with, the third 

217
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,740
method we will 

218
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,980
look at is the addition method. This can 
also be used for 

219
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,160
systems of equations with three or more 

220
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,580
equations. And we'll 

221
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,880

222
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,340

223
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,820
discuss this with three or more equations 
in the next webinar . Right, back to the 

224
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,900
equation method. 

225
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,420
For now, we have the same starting point 

226
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,220
as before. As you can see, we have a 

227
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,820
different system of equations, but that 

228
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,460
doesn't detract from the point. The aim 

229
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,740
of the equation method 

230
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,060
is simply to 

231
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,180

232
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,760

233
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,900
convert both equations, which is very 
important, both equations, i.e. the upper 
and lower equations , to the same 
variable, i.e. 

234
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,880
to convert either to x or to y 

235
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,060
and then to 

236
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,000
equate the two equations. 

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,220
Let's take a look at that now 

238
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,340
and then 

239
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,700
solve the newly created equation. In other 
words, the 

240
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,960
first step is, of course, 

241
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,560
to convert the two equations to the 

242
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,220
same variable, i.e. x 

243
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,000
or y. As you can see, we have 

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
decided in favor of y at this point 

245
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,340
and therefore we 

246
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,460
first calculate 

247
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,800
minus 2x for the first equation so that 
the 3y stands alone 

248
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,640
and minus 

249
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,640
x for the lower equation so that the 4y 
stands alone. 

250
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,220
We then arrive at 3y is equal to minus 1 

251
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,500
minus 2x and 4y is equal to minus 2 

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,340
and minus x. Now, of course, we 

253
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,540
don't want to 3y and 4y... but only 

254
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,360
y. This is very important. 

255
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,800
Both must be exactly the same. 

256
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,040
Of course, 

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,700
10y can also be written for both. That 
would also work. But you 

258
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,380
are always on the safe side if 

259
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,900
you 

260
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,400
have the variable without a factor. This 
means 

261
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,080
that we divide the upper equation, the 

262
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,500
first one by 3 and the lower one by 4, 

263
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,480
which of course results 

264
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,400
in a few fractions. We 

265
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,620
then know that y is equal to minus one 

266
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,400
third minus two thirds x or y 

267
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,380
is equal to minus one half minus one 

268
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,420
quarter x. And now comes a 

269
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,300
step that we need to understand. 

270
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,880
Our variable y has a 

271
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,660
certain value. This value is 

272
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,060
of course the same for both, which means 

273
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,060
that this 

274
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,360
term here and this term here 

275
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,060
have the same value simply because they 

276
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,620
both describe the same y and 

277
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,260
we simply make use of this 

278
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,040
and set these two terms 

279
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,820
equal here, yes, we simply say y 

280
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,900
is equal to y y, that is, minus 1 

281
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,920
third minus 2 thirds x is equal to 

282
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,220
minus 1 half minus 1 quarter x. And 

283
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,280
you can see here again that we have 

284
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,900
got rid of our linear system of equations 

285
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,560
, so to speak. We now only have a 

286
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,840
normal linear equation, so 

287
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,280
we only have x as a variable and 

288
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,760
we can now calculate that. 

289
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,620
Of course, this is a bit 

290
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,400
messier now because of the fractions, but 
that 

291
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,780
shouldn't detract from the point. 

292
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,120
Well, the first thing we want to do is 

293
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,420
get rid of this minus 1 third. 

294
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,580
Of course, we simply do this 

295
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,260
by adding a plus 1 third. Then, 

296
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,960
of course, we need to do a bit of 

297
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,260
fractional arithmetic. Minus 1.5 plus 1 

298
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,780
third is minus 1 sixth. 

299
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,880
Remember, before you add them up, 

300
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,660
either use a calculator or 

301
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,160
just reduce them to a denominator first. 

302
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,300
That would be minus 3 

303
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,800
sixths plus 1 third. So a 

304
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
third is 2 sixths, then 

305
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,920
we have minus 3 sixths plus 2 

306
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,080
sixths is then minus 1 sixth. 

307
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,420
Well, of course we 

308
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,180
also have something with x here on the 
right , so we are 

309
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,660
apparently collecting the x on the 
left-hand 

310
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,680
side, which is why we calculate plus 1 

311
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,280
quarter x and arrive at minus 5 

312
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,220
twelfths x equals minus 1 

313
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,640
sixth. So now only 

314
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,860
the minus 1 quarter x. x 

315
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,540
have been moved over. Nothing more was 

316
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,620
done. And you can see that we have 

317
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,640
all our x on the left-hand side 

318
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,720
and all the absolute members on the 

319
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,280
right-hand side. For us, this means that 

320
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,840
we are now in the last step, 

321
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,520
we now divide again by the 

322
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,020
factor before the x, which in this case is 

323
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,740
minus 5 twelfths. So we 

324
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,420
calculate minus 1 sixth divided 

325
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,660
by minus 5 twelfths and 

326
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,120
arrive at a result of x 

327
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
equals 2 fifths. 

328
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,720
And with that, we have 

329
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,000
actually 

330
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,840
already completed the equating process. We 
now know the 

331
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,140
value for our x. Of course, 

332
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,620
the value for our y is still missing. 

333
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,780
We do this in the same way as 

334
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,820
with the substitution method at the end. 

335
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,280
We simply insert the value for our 

336
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,300
x into the other equation. This 

337
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,800
is minus one third minus 

338
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,140
two thirds of x. We 

339
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,180
now use the two distributions for the x. 

340
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,440
This results in y being equal to minus one 

341
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,420
third minus two thirds times two 

342
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,180
fifths, which is then minus three 

343
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,720
fifths. We enter the whole thing again 

344
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,180
as the solution set and then we have 

345
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,440
also solved this system of equations 

346
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,280
. 

347
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,140
As you can see, the 

348
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,440
equation method is 

349
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,080
not much more difficult than the 

350
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,160
substitution method. The additional work 

351
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,460
involved in the equation method 

352
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,480
is simply that you often 

353
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,980

354
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,060
have to convert both equations to one 
variable. Of course, if you 

355
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,520
have already done this, then 

356
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,780
the equating method is 

357
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,560
the obvious choice . Do you have a 
question about this 

358
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,840
? No 

359
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,520
question? 

360
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,030
Good. Then, as a final sentence, 

361
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,610
a quick reminder. 

362
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,090
Like 

363
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,990
the substitution method , you can only use 
the equating method for 

364
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,290
linear systems of equations, i.e. for 

365
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,710
systems of equations with two 

366
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,030
equations. This is the 

367
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,990
big difference to the 

368
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,630
addition method. The 

369
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,370
addition method can be used for 

370
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,070
systems of equations with any 

371
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,670
number of equations. 

372
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,210
However, the addition method is 

373
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,550
also the more difficult method, 

374
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,090
which 

375
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,590
causes more problems for most pupils. And 

376
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,610
I would say, let's 

377
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,850
just take a look at it. The 

378
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,650
addition method will definitely be 

379
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,470

380
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,070
dealt with in the second webinar because 
it is 

381
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,850
simply the basis of the solution 

382
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,530
procedure there well we see 

383
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,610
another new 

384
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,670
system of equations and this time the 

385
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,810
goal is a completely different one, namely 

386
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,890
the addition method, that is 

387
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,490
because we will go there later to 

388
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,170
add or 

389
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,290
subtract equations , that is, we calculate 

390
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,450
them plus or minus. And the aim is to 

391
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,490

392
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,670
add or subtract them so skillfully 

393
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,530
that variables are eliminated. This means 

394
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,110
that when we 

395
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,830
add two equations , we lose one 

396
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,110
variable . In other words, if 

397
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,310
we were to add the two together, 

398
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,990
one variable, 

399
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,350
either the x or the y, would be 

400
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,430
deleted. Of course, this requires 

401
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,610
a certain 

402
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,990
initial situation. When 

403
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,990
adding , this means that you 

404
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,330
have the same number of x's or y's, only 

405
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,090
reversed . 

406
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,390
So as not to take away the solution, let' 

407
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,590
s take a look at this. 

408
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,770
We have 3x plus y and x minus 

409
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,950
y. If we 

410
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,550
now add these two equations together, we 
have 3x 

411
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,330
plus y plus x minus y. In other words, we 
have 

412
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,090
one plus y and one minus 

413
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,450
y. That falls out. 

414
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,510
This means that only 3x plus x would 
remain. 

415
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,950
Of course, we always have to 

416
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,470

417
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,430
add the other two sides, in this case 36 
plus 0. 

418
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,460
And now let's take a look at the whole 
thing 

419
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,520
here. In order to make the whole thing 
less 

420
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,060
simple, we have 

421
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,080
decided not to 

422
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,240

423
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
select the y as I did in the small verbal 
example, 

424
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,160
but rather, as you may 

425
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,760
have already seen, to 

426
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,160
delete the X. And we can already see 

427
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,880
here that we don't have the same 

428
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,360
number of Xs. We have 3X at the top and 

429
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,140
just 1X at the bottom. And 

430
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,580
both are currently positive. And I 

431
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,280
just mentioned two 

432
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,120
prerequisites. That was 

433
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,400
easy, the first requirement is 

434
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,820
that it 

435
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,080

436
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,000
has the same amount of occurrences, i.e. 
both three times. We already don't have 
that. And 

437
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,540
then, of course, it also has to 

438
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,660
be reversed in sign. 

439
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,300
We don't have that either. 

440
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,340
So we multiply by minus 3, 

441
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,100
with minus simply so 

442
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,280
that the sign is reversed. And 

443
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,260
with 3 simply because 3 times 1 is 3. 

444
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,280
Then we have the same number of times as 
in 

445
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,140
the first equation. It is very important 
to note 

446
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,300
that the 

447
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,680
whole equation is 

448
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,880
multiplied by this factor. In other words, 
we calculate 

449
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,240
x times minus 3 and minus y times minus 

450
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,080
3. This gives us minus 3x plus 3y 

451
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,060
and 0 times minus 3 is 0. This is very 

452
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,300
important. Please never forget 

453
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,780
to multiply the right-hand side. 

454
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,400
Unfortunately, this happens very often. 
and after 

455
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
we have done this, you can look 

456
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,340
at it again here, 

457
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,960
we can see that we have 

458
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,740

459
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,340
the same amount. So now we go 

460
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,160
and add the two equations together. 

461
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,740
In other words, we go and calculate 3x 

462
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,040
plus y minus 3x plus 3y and that's 

463
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,900
4y. On the right-hand side, 36 plus 0 

464
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,080
is 36. And you can see that we 

465
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,360
only have a 

466
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,540
very simple linear equation in the upper 
equation . So 

467
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,620
4y equals 36. 

468
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,800
The only thing we 

469
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,760
have to do now is 

470
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,560
divide by the factor in front of the y. 
That s 4 . That is 4, so we 

471
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,500
calculate 36 divided by 4. That 

472
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,060
is 9 and now we already know that y 

473
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,280
equals 9. To 

474
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
determine the second variable , in this 
case 

475
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,780
x, we take the next 

476
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,740
equation, which is this one. As you can 
see, 

477
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,640
this is a little 

478
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,420
more complicated than the previous 

479
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,400
solution methods. 

480
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,920
Again, we substitute our y for the y. 

481
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
In other words, we know that minus 3x 

482
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,420
plus 3y equals 0 and we 

483
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,820
now substitute our y equals 9 for 

484
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,960
the y here. This gives us minus 3x 

485
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,040
plus 3 times 9 equals 0. So minus 3x 

486
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,860
plus 27 equals 0. 

487
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,600
Of course, we want our x 

488
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,580
to be alone on the page, so 

489
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,600
we calculate with minus 27 and arrive at 

490
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,220
minus 3x equals minus 27. 

491
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,560
Next, we just divide by 

492
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,400
the factor for our variable. This 

493
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,420
is minus 3 in this case and minus 

494
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,980
27 divided by minus 3 is 9. This means 

495
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,420
that our solution set y is 

496
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,660
equal to 9 and x is also equal to 9. And 

497
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,900
that's the 

498
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,980
end of the addition process. The fact that 
we 

499
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,360
can manage with just one addition, i.e. 
the step 

500
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,480
here, that we 

501
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,780
have only added two equations once with 
one, 

502
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,420
is because we only 

503
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,200
have two equations yes if we 

504
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,760
have three equations then you 

505
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,340
often have to do the whole thing three 
times and if 

506
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,580
you have four more often 

507
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,020
yes that's very important not that you 

508
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,420
now think that you can always 

509
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,060
get away with just one edition that would 
be 

510
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,640
too good do you have a 

511
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,040
question about this as 

512
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,790
I said you are welcome to ask questions 

513
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,770
so 

514
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,780
I can 

515
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,080
explain the procedure again or is there a 

516
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,200
certain point where it didn't quite 

517
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,600
work with the 

518
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,350
foil that I was 

519
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,750
confused for a moment I think I'm confused 
because in order to 

520
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,470

521
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,150
carry out the addition procedure now 

522
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,090
you first have to 

523
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,370

524
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,290

525
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,110

526
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,930

527
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,050

528
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,790
have the same number in front of you in 
terms of amount, i.e. both times three and 
the sign is not taken into account yes 
that means we first have to have the same 
number of x or y in terms of amount. So 

529
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,990
we already have both times 3 here. And 
then 

530
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,030
the sign must be reversed. 

531
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,510
In other words, we have a plus here 

532
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,490
and a minus here. This must first 

533
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,010
be given before we 

534
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,630
can add anything. This means that if you 

535
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,630
want to use the addition method, 

536
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,350
the first step is always to 

537
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,470
create this initial state. 

538
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,670
This means that we have to 

539
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,310

540
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,770
have the same amount of x or y in both 
equations , but 

541
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,550
with reversed signs. In other words, we 

542
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,930
look at the equation above and see, 

543
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:30,150
okay, we have 3x above and in the 

544
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,570
second equation we only have x. 

545
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,470
This means we have to 

546
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,350
multiply the second equation so that we 

547
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,210
get minus 3x. And that's why 

548
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,610
we multiply by times minus 3, 

549
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,990
and then we're already down here. 

550
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,510
However, it is very important when you 

551
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,090
multiply by times minus 3 that 

552
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,750
you calculate x times minus 3. That is 

553
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,770
then minus 3x and minus y times minus 

554
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,290
3. That is then plus 3y. In the same way, 
the 

555
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,150
right-hand side of the equal sign must 

556
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,410
also be multiplied by minus 3 

557
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,710
. But 0 times minus 3 remains 0. 

558
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,870
Then you have 

559
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,750
created this initial state. And then you 
see, here 

560
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,890
we have... we have 3x and here 

561
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,670
we have minus 3x. So exactly the 

562
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,110
same, only the sign is reversed. And 

563
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,310
now we can 

564
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,330
start adding. Yes. As I said, this is 

565
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,850
the most important step. 

566
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,510
Please don't add anything beforehand . Do 
you have 

567
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,170
a question about this ? 

568
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,740
Or have you understood it so far 

569
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,140
? 

570
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,060
Okay. As I said, that's the 

571
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,360
most important thing. And if you 

572
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,220
've given that , then you can already see 
at 

573
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,580
this point that if you 

574
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,920
add both equations together, the x will 

575
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,680
drop out. For the following 

576
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,140
reason. We're doing the math now. I'll 

577
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,630
write something about it very briefly. 

578
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,870
The 4y is nothing more than 3x 

579
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,490
plus y minus this 

580
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,520
term, i.e. minus 3x, sorry, 

581
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,340
minus 3x plus 3y. 

582
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,040
Now we have 3x minus 3x. That 

583
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,220
falls out. That was precisely the 

584
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,900
reason why we 

585
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,460
were riding around on the same amount. And 

586
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,700
now we have y plus 3y. That's 

587
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,880
the 4y. And with that, you've 

588
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,140

589
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,600
already taken off the addition method 
itself. You have added the two 

590
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,840
equations and now it's 

591
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,280
just a matter of solving this new equation 

592
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,320
and then substituting 

593
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,300
the solution into the other equation 

594
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,460
. Have you 

595
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,360
understood this step? 

596
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:51,770
Okay, you just go and add 

597
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,790
these two equations together. 

598
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,210
Just think of a plus in between. 3x plus 

599
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,570
y plus minus 3x. Plus and minus makes 

600
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,430
minus, so minus 3x plus 3y. That's all we 

601
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,230
've done. On the 

602
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,270
other hand, of course, we do 

603
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:09,930
the same thing. 

604
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,590
Don't you understand why we do this 

605
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,810
or don't you understand how 

606
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,050
we do it? The 

607
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,640
how is very simple. You take 

608
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,780
the two equations and then 

609
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,060
you actually write them one 

610
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,100
after the other. So 3x plus y 

611
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,180
minus 3x plus 3y. That's exactly what 

612
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,260
I wrote here. 3x 

613
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
plus y minus 3x plus 3y. 

614
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,730
Yes? And you already know 

615
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,390
that the step is correct if 

616
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,470
one variable is suddenly dropped out. 

617
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,910
We then just went 

618
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,070
and simplified this. 

619
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,390
And the result was 4y. 

620
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,240
Got that? Or should 

621
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,860
I go into it again? 

622
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,820
Good. As I said, this step is 

623
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,760
actually always correct if 

624
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,820
one of the variables drops out at the end. 

625
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,260
You then always have the case that you 

626
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,120
have something like 3x plus y minus 3x 

627
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,340
plus 3y, i.e. the sign 

628
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,080
is reversed exactly once and falls out. 

629
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
That's why this is 

630
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,400
always simplified immediately , as it was 
done here. And 

631
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,760
we then only have y plus 

632
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,200
3y, i.e. 4y. Everything that comes after 
that, 

633
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,380
just with the addition methods, is 

634
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,340
no longer the essential 

635
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,120
component. Let's put it 

636
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,200
like this. Now we really only have 

637
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,480
the means to an end, i.e. 

638
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
rearranging the new equation according to 
y, i.e. 

639
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,000
calculating by 4, then we know y 

640
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,820
equals 9 and 

641
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,500
insert y equals 9 into the lower equation 
so that we 

642
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,360
can determine the x. . That was 

643
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,780
also 9. And that completes 

644
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,020
the addition process, as 

645
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,180
I said. So the 

646
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,660
real trick or the 

647
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,620
real problem in the 

648
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,920
addition method is always 

649
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,580
this step. And this step 

650
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,260
is not so easy to 

651
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,100
understand and it is also 

652
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,660

653
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,240

654
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,780
not 

655
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,140
necessarily easy to create this initial 
situation where the amounts are the same 
but the signs are reversed . It simply 
requires 

656
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,900
a certain amount of practice, but 

657
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,260
I can reassure you that this will come 
with 

658
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,540
time. 

659
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,300
That's our three 

660
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,300
solution methods Let's take another 

661
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,460
quick look at the graphical 

662
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,020
meaning of solutions We see 

663
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
three cases here and there are only 

664
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,200
three cases If there is exactly one 
solution 

665
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,240
, then the two lines have 

666
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,300
an intersection point If there is no 

667
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,960
solution, or a 

668
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,400
false statement Something like 6 is 

669
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,460
equal to 0 Then the two 

670
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,060
lines run parallel to each other and there 

671
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,420
is no 

672
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,220
intersection point at any point. So you 
have to imagine it 

673
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,560
like this: if the two 

674
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
lines intersect, you have an 

675
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,100
unambiguous solution. As you can see, 

676
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,520
they never intersect here. 

677
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,820
This means that there is no unique 

678
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,760
solution. The third possibility is 

679
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,280
that we 

680
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
have an infinite number of solutions. This 
means that the lines lie 

681
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,660
inside each other. You notice this when 
you do 

682
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,880
the maths, a true 

683
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,580
statement emerges , something like 0 is 
equal to 0 

684
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,300
or 5 is equal to 5. These are the 

685
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,460
three possibilities. 

686
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,760
Let's move on briefly to the 

687
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,920
factual tasks. We have a 

688
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,040
small number puzzle here and we 

689
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,300
are looking for two numbers. The first 

690
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,620
number is 15 greater than the second 

691
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,500
number. The double of the first number 

692
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,620
is four times as big as the double of 

693
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,560
the second number. Okay, 

694
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,020
let's define two numbers first. We say x 

695
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,680
is the first number and y is the second 

696
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,000
number. And we know that the first number 

697
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,180
is 15 times bigger than the second number. 

698
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,880
That means x is equal to y plus 15. 

699
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,160
And we also know that twice the 

700
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,600
first number is four times as big as 

701
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,520
twice the second number. So, 

702
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,780
the double of the first number is 

703
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,660
2x. And now comes the tricky bit. 4 

704
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,500
times as big, i.e. 4 times, as the 

705
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,840
double of the second number. So 4 times 

706
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,800
2 times the second number, i.e. y. 

707
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,080
This is how this 4 times 2 comes about. 4 
times 

708
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,860
the double. The 

709
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,340
double is always 2. 

710
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,640
And that is our second 

711
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,340
equation. So the first equation 

712
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,680
is x. is equal to y plus 15 and 

713
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,980
the second equation is 2x is 

714
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,380
equal to 4 times 2y. Do you have a 

715
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,840
question about this ? We will 

716
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,830

717
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,850
of course solve the system of equations in 
a moment. 

718
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,650
Before you 

719
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,510
start a number puzzle like this, it is 
very important that 

720
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,550
you first 

721
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,370
add variables to the numbers. We have now 
simply 

722
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,550
said that x is the first number, y the 

723
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,270
second number. And it says that the 

724
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,410
first number is 15 greater than the 

725
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,070
second number. This means that x is equal 
to 

726
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,430
y plus 15, because x is 15 greater 

727
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,510
than y. That means y plus 15 is x. 

728
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,730
The second is a bit 

729
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,970
more complicated. The double, i.e. 

730
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,310
whenever it says the double, 

731
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,010
then it is times 2. 2. The double 

732
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:46,530
of x, i.e. 2x is equal to 4 times as 

733
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,230
big, i.e. 4 times, as the double 

734
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,230
of the second number, i.e. 4 times 2 times 

735
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,870
the second number y. That's how you have 
to 

736
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,250
read it. 

737
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,180
Here too, I can advise you to 

738
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,600
practise a bit over time 

739
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,780
so that you 

740
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,320
can solve something like this more quickly 

741
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,640
. And you have to read them 

742
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,780
several times. 

743
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,560
And, as I said, these are our two 

744
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,520
equations. We only have 

745
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,180
two variables. And then you 

746
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,260
simply put them into a linear 

747
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,340
system of equations. And as you can see, 

748
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
we have once again 

749
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,620
opted for the equation method here. 

750
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,400
This means that we 

751
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,580
first have to 

752
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,560
transform to the same variable. We have 
chosen x here 

753
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,100
. As you can see, the upper 

754
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,200
equation is immediately 

755
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
transformed to x. The lower equation still 
has 

756
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,920
a 2, which is why we divide 

757
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,340
by 2 so that the x 

758
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,760
stands alone there too. Please divide both 

759
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,760
the left and right sides. 

760
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:56,120
2x divided by 2 is x and 4 times 2y 

761
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,900
divided by 2 is simply 4y. So 

762
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,120
4 times 2y is 8y and 8 divided 

763
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,040
by 2 is 4y again. And now 

764
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,540
we have 

765
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,060
rearranged both equations to y and can now 

766
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,420
equate them. We arrive at 4y 

767
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,700
equals y plus 15. We want to 

768
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,480

769
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,100
collect our ys on the left-hand side , so 
we calculate minus 

770
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,240
y. We then arrive at 3y equals 15. 

771
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,760
Now we have to divide by 3 

772
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,060
and arrive at y equals 5. And 

773
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,980
now, of course, we want to 

774
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,780
determine our x. We know that x is equal 
to 4 

775
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,540
times y or, in other words, x is 

776
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,540
equal to 4 times 5. That's 20. In other 

777
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,480
words, we now know that the first 

778
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,180
number is 20 and the second number is 

779
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,140
5. And that 

780
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,000
completes the task. 

781
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,410
Was that clear enough? 

782
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,790
Okay, wonderful. Then we've come to 

783
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,750
the end of the webinar. I 

784
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,830
hope you enjoyed it, 

785
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,570
that you were able to take something away 
with you and that we 

786
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,170
still have 5 minutes left for a 

787
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,190
short Q&A session. This means that if you 

788
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,470
still have questions, you are very 

789
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,570
welcome to ask them in the chat. If you 

790
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,650
have no more questions, then I can 

791
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,730
only wish you a nice 

792
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,570
Monday evening and 

793
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,990
of course 

794
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,530
thank you for your attention. 

795
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,120
Then I wish you a 

796
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,400
nice evening. You 

797
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,370
can simply leave the room by 

798
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,870
closing the window or tab 

799
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,210
. 

800
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,520
Thank you too. Bye.
