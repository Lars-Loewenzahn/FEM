00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,870
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,150
analytical geometry positional 
relationships 

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,770
part 2. In this webinar we will 

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,030
look at the positional relationship 
between a 

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,650
line and a plane. 

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,390
We will also look at what 

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,550
the calculations look like when the 

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,890
plane 

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,210
is given in parameter form and coordinate 
form. 

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,050
We will also look at the 

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,590
positional relationship between two planes 

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,090
and how to calculate this. It is important 
to note 

13
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,950
that there is always one plane in 

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,390
coordinate form and another... 

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,890
plane is given in parameter form. 

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,270

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,870
We will 

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,050
see how the calculation looks at this 
point. Now we come to the 

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,070
case of a straight line plane. 

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,550

21
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,950
There are three cases for the positional 
relationship between a line and a plane. 

22
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,970
The first case is that the straight line 

23
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,730
is parallel to the plane. The second 

24
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,330
case is that the line 

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,230
lies in the plane. And the third case is 
that 

26
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,930
the line 

27
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,330
has a point of intersection with the 
plane. As 

28
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,570
already mentioned, there are only these 
three cases here ; 

29
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,090
unlike the bearing relationship between 

30
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,850
two degrees, there is no 

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,690
possibility that it is skewed. 

32
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,590
To 

33
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,250
calculate the position between the line 
and the plane, we 

34
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,830
first look at the direction vectors 

35
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,430
. We check whether the 

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,970
direction vectors of the plane 

37
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,850
are linearly dependent on the direction 
vector of the 

38
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,050
degree. In other words, we look 

39
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,290

40
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,730

41
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,630
at the direction vectors in a similar way 
to the bearing relationship between two 
degrees and 

42
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,730
see whether we 

43
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,550

44
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,050

45
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,430
can represent the direction vector of the 
degrees by the two direction vectors of 
the plane. If this is the case 

46
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,830
, the straight line is either parallel 

47
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,470
to the plane or lies in the plane. In 
order to 

48
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,770

49
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,050

50
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,770
be able to distinguish between these two 
cases , the point test is 

51
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,630
carried out. In the point test, 

52
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,010
the support vector of the line is then 

53
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,510
equated with the plane and you 

54
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,910
can then see whether the point 

55
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,590
is part of the plane or not. This means 

56
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,290
that if the point test is successful 

57
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,950
and the support vector is in the plane 

58
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,690
, the 

59
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,710
entire straight line is also in the plane. 

60
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,310
If the point test is not successful, 

61
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,850
i.e. the support vector does not lie on 
the 

62
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,230
plane, the line is simply 

63
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,310
parallel. It is different if we 

64
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,430
assume an intersection point, 

65
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,930
because then the 

66
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,490
direction vector of the degree is linearly 

67
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,370
independent of the direction vectors 

68
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,790
of the plane, i.e. when we first 

69
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,470
check the direction vectors we would 

70
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,590
find out that they are independent 

71
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,910
and then check directly for an 

72
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,930
intersection point because then there must 

73
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,050
be an intersection point, i.e. 

74
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,090
we 

75
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,790

76
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,390
then set the degrees of the straight line 
g equal to the plane 

77
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,950
. First of all, we can see 

78
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,430
that the parametric form of a plane 

79
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,330
is characterized by the fact that it 

80
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,830
contains two direction vectors. 

81
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,290
This means that this is our plane in 

82
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,930
parametric form and this is our 

83
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,450
linear equation also in 

84
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,970
parametric form. First, 

85
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,330
we check the linear dependency. 

86
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,750
In other words, we look to see whether we 

87
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,670

88
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,290

89
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,090

90
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,830

91
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,710
can represent the direction vector of the 
E, resolution, the direction vector of the 
straight line, i.e. this one here, by the 
two direction vectors of the plane. These 
are the 

92
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,610
two planes. In other words, we check 

93
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,890
this and in this case we find 

94
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,830
that the direction vector 

95
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,110
of the straight line can be 

96
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,390

97
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,770
represented by the two direction vectors 
of the plane. The factor would be 1 or 1 

98
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,610
.5, because 1 is equal to 1.5 times 1 plus 

99
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,430
0.5 times 0, so 1 is equal to 1. That 

100
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,490
fits. 1 is equal to 1 times 1 plus 1 

101
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,530
half times 0, so 1 is equal to 1, which 

102
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,210
also fits. And 1 is equal to 1 times 0 

103
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,290
plus 1 half times 2, so in the end 1 is 

104
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,690
equal to 1. So they are linearly 

105
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,790
dependent. Consequently, we assume that 

106
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,470
the straight line is parallel to the plane 

107
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,750
or part of the plane. Therefore, 

108
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,410
we now check the support vector of the 

109
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,350
line g and use it to perform a 

110
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,990
point test with the plane. In other words, 

111
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,770
we 

112
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,010
equate the support vector with the plane. 
We can see here that 1.02 

113
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,670
is the support vector of the line and 

114
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,870
this here on the right is the 

115
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,090
equation of the plane. And this is 

116
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,670
then 3.23 plus S times 1.10 plus T times 

117
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,830
0.02 and this is equal to our 

118
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,070
support vector 1.02. The first thing 

119
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,330

120
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,630
to see here is the calculation technique, 
our parameters on one side 

121
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,690
together, or our 

122
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,230
direction vectors including the 

123
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,910
associated parameters on one side 

124
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,070
together and 

125
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,230
the vectors on the other side. This means 
that the 

126
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,510
support vector here, the 3, 2, 3, 

127
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,730
should be added, so we calculate 

128
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,610
minus the vector 3, 2, 3. 

129
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,850
This gives us the vector minus 2, minus 2, 

130
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,730
minus 1 is equal to S times 1, 1, 0 plus 

131
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,710
T times 0, 0, 2. And 

132
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,710
we can use this to 

133
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,770
set up the system of equations. This 

134
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,710
is simply minus 2 equals s 

135
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,190
times 1 plus 0 times t. Minus 2 is 

136
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,470
equal to s times 1 plus 0 times t. And 

137
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,030
minus 1 is equal to s times 0 plus t times 

138
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,790
2. We have thus set up this 

139
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,010
system of equations. 

140
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,430
In this case, it is a very 

141
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,070
simple one. It is worth mentioning 

142
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,010
that these 

143
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,650
are not always so simple. And even if you 

144
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,430
have to do more math . We have three 
equations 

145
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,030
and two unknowns here , which means we 

146
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,170
have an overdetermined 

147
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,430
system of equations. So you go 

148
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,910
and use just two of the three 

149
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,390
equations to determine the two 

150
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,850
unknowns and 

151
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,210
then 

152
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,650
do the test with the equation that has not 
yet been used. This 

153
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,790
is not absolutely 

154
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,070
necessary in our case , the bores 

155
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,110
directly state that minus 2 is equal to S, 
minus 2 

156
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,050
is equal to S, which fits and 

157
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,670
minus 1 is equal to 2T. So that's 

158
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,970
solved for us and we can see that we 

159
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,330
have a uniform solution here 

160
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,410
and therefore the straight line is part of 
the 

161
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,350
plane. And the straight line is therefore 

162
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,050
really in the plane and 

163
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,350
the bearing relationship is thus 
clarified. 

164
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,560
Here we have an example of 

165
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,860
another case. 

166
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,440
Again, we have a straight line G and a 

167
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,500
plane E in parameter form 

168
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,920
, both given. And, of course, 

169
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,380
the first thing we check here is the 

170
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,940
linear dependency. 

171
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,120
Again , we find 

172
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
that the direction vector of the straight 
line, i.e. 

173
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
this one, is linearly dependent on the 

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,780
two direction vectors of the plane. 

175
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,440
The factors are the same here, 

176
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,280
i.e. they are also linearly dependent 

177
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,840
, which is why we 

178
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,000
first check whether the 

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,900
support vector is part of the plane. 

180
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,880
In other words, we do the point test. 

181
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,280
So we again 

182
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,420

183
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,900
equate the support vector, in this case 2, 
5, 3, with the plane E. So we arrive at 

184
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,780
2, 5, 3 is equal to 3, 2, 3 plus S times 

185
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,840
1, 1, 0 plus T times 0, 0, 2. And 

186
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,120
here we go again, we 

187
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,080
want to 

188
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,160

189
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,040
collect our two direction vectors with the 
parameters on the right-hand side and the 

190
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,900
other vector on the left-hand side. 

191
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,640
Therefore, this vector 

192
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,940
3, 2, 3 should be removed here and we 
calculate 

193
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,800
minus 3, 2, 3. If we arrive at 2, 

194
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,300
minus 3 is the minus 1, 5 minus 2 

195
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,120
is the 3, 3 minus 3 is the 0. This brings 
us 

196
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,340
to the equation 

197
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,540
, or rather the equation 

198
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,380
minus 1, 3, 0 is equal to S times 1, 1, 

199
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,140
0 plus T times 0, 0, 2. 

200
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,260
We turn this equation into a 

201
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,920
system of equations. Again 

202
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,360
, this is a simple 

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,080
case. if the equation or 

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,940
system of equations is a little more 
complex, 

205
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,800
take two equations 

206
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
so that 

207
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,920
you can determine the two unknowns and do 

208
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,980
the test at the end with the third 
equation 

209
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,020
- please make sure you 

210
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,780
do the test 

211
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,120
because if you 

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,660
have determined the solution from the two 
equations, it 

213
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,820
does not mean that the third equation 

214
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,000
has a true solution and that 

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,600

216
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
you have really calculated a solution here 
we see it here 

217
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,060
it says minus 1 is equal to 1s, 3 is 

218
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,520
equal to s and 0 is equal to 2t. Here 

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,920
we already have it. Two equations. 

220
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,260
Suppose we only had two. 

221
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,840
If we had minus 1 equals s and 0 equals 

222
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,440
2t. Okay, that sounds good 

223
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,120
. 

224
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,100
Unfortunately , the third equation says 
that 3 equals s. And that 

225
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,340
is not a clear solution. We 

226
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,520
have two different 

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,860
solutions for s. therefore the 

228
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,440
equation system cannot be solved or the 

229
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,680
straight line is parallel to the plane 

230
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,360
so the point test has failed 

231
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,280
the straight line and the plane have no 

232
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,160
common point therefore the 

233
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,930
straight line is parallel to the plane 
this brings us 

234
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,510
to the last 

235
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,530
case we already had straight line 

236
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,970
is in the plane and straight line is 

237
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,510
parallel to the plane therefore the 

238
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,930
last case is now an intersection 

239
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,670
also here we have again 

240
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,130

241
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,030
given the straight line in parameter form 
and the plane parameter form also here 

242
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,610
we first check the linear 

243
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,890
dependence and 

244
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,850
of course we now realize that the 

245
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,790
direction vector of the straight line is 
linearly 

246
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,390
independent of the two 

247
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,010
direction vectors of the plane this 

248
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,670
means that the straight line is in 

249
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,690
no case parallel or identical 

250
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,130
in no case parallel or 

251
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,410
in no case lies in the plane it 

252
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,950
definitely has an intersection point and 
therefore 

253
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,170
we also check for this 

254
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,010
intersection point this means we 

255
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,790
now equate the straight line with the 
plane 

256
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,230
we see here on the left the 

257
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,090
equation of the degree here on the right, 
the 

258
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,250
equation of the plane is simply 

259
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,530
set to g is equal and now 

260
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,090
we solve this equation 

261
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,430
. here, too , the approach is to 

262
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,970

263
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,470

264
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,490
collect the direction vectors including 
the parameters on the right-hand side. you 
can 

265
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,430
do this here on the left-hand side and 

266
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,430
then 

267
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,370
always the vector on the corresponding 
other side . That's why 

268
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,590
we calculate minus r times 0, 1, 0 so that 

269
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,690
this vector goes over here and we 

270
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,070
calculate minus, minus 1, 0, minus 3 

271
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,370
so that the vector also 

272
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,190
goes over here . 2, minus, minus 1, 

273
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,370
sorry, 1, minus, minus 1 is 

274
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,710
then 2, 1, minus 0 is 1, 1, 

275
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,150
minus, minus 3, so 1 plus 3 is 

276
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,490
4. 

277
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,800
Now it 

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,080
continues on the other side the two 
vectors remain the same 

279
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,920
so it times 110 plus topic 002 minus 

280
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,520
r times 0 1 0 make sure that there 

281
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,200
is still a minus this is now 

282
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,120
important if we 

283
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,860
make a system of equations out of the 
equation 

284
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,180
then we get two is 

285
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,720
equal to it times 1 plus topic 0 minus 

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,700
once 0 so two is it and 1 is 

287
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,820
equal to it times 1 plus topic 0 minus 

288
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,840
once 1 so 1 is equal to s minus r 

289
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,040
and 4 is equal to 0 times s plus t times 2 

290
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,920
minus r times 0, so 4 is equal to 2t. 

291
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,140
In this case, we have a 

292
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,080
system of equations with three unknowns 

293
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,320
and three equations. 

294
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,100
This means that this system of equations 
is not 

295
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,880
overdetermined compared to the ones we 

296
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,000
dealt with earlier. Therefore 

297
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,080
, you need to solve all the equations of 
the 

298
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,600
system of equations and you 

299
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,920
don't have to 

300
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,360
do a test at the end. From our system of 
equations 

301
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
, the solutions... equals 2, r 

302
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,940
equals 1 and t equals 2. In order to 

303
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
specify the intersection 

304
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,960
as a point, we still need to 

305
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,620
calculate it. We know the parameters 

306
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,060
for which the point of intersection exists 

307
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,280
and must now, as already mentioned, insert 
the 

308
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,880
parameters into the plane equation or 

309
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,980
the linear equation. 

310
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,640
We can therefore enter s and t in the 

311
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
plane equation or we can 

312
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,060
enter R equal to 1 in the 

313
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,460
linear equation. 

314
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,120
As a rule, we always insert the parameter 
into the 

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,940
linear equation, simply because it is 

316
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,780
quicker. Regardless of whether you 

317
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,960
use S and T or R, you must arrive at the 

318
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,800
same point, otherwise there is 

319
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,580
a calculation error. 

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,580
That's why you usually use the 

321
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,220
easy way and insert the parameter into 

322
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,560
the linear equation. So R 

323
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,860
equals 1, we now do this 

324
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,820
in sequence and arrive at the 

325
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,760
equation 1, 1, 1 plus 1 times 0, 1, 0 

326
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,980
and that equals 1 plus 1 times 0 is 

327
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,540
1, 1 plus 1 times 1 is 2, 1 plus 1 times 

328
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,820
0 is 1 again. Consequently, 

329
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,800
our intersection point is 1, 2, 1 and 

330
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,340
we have 

331
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,900
calculated the intersection point. Next, 
let's take a look 

332
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,620
at the calculation technique if it 

333
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,400
is given in coordinate form. 

334
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,780
We can see the coordinate form 

335
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,740
here. The coordinate form contains the 

336
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,100
elements x, y and z. 

337
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,460
And to put it briefly, if 

338
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,140
you 

339
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,220
calculate it using the coordinate form , 
you'll be much better off 

340
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,580
because it's much 

341
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,800
easier and faster. As you can see 

342
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,900
, the calculation we have just 

343
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,440
done is much shorter 

344
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,300
and you don't need 

345
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,760
a system of equations. That's the 
advantage 

346
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,000
of the coordinate form. So we 

347
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
see here, our plane in 

348
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,780
coordinate form 2x minus 1y plus 3z 

349
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,300
equals 19 the x or for the x 

350
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,180
we put right here this is the x line 

351
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,520
for the y here the y line and 

352
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,220
for the z here the z line yes so 

353
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,020
this is what is meant by that 

354
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,660
put the even g in e we now put 

355
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,540
1 plus 1r for the x for the y 2 plus 

356
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,800
0 times r for the z 3 plus r times 1 

357
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,580
we have done that here and now 

358
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,840
we see we have an equation here 

359
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,740
that only has R as an unknown. And 

360
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,480
we can now solve it. So we 

361
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,240
can rearrange the whole thing according to 
R. 

362
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,640
And that's why the first thing we're going 
to do is break 

363
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,420
up the brackets. 2 times 1 is 2, 

364
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,960
2 times 1R is 2R, minus 1 times 2 

365
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,960
is minus 2, minus 1 times 0R is 

366
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,500
simply 0, so it falls out. 3 

367
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,400
times 3 is the 9 and 3 times 1R is the 

368
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,780
3R and the 19 remains for now. 

369
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,940
Next, let's try 

370
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,400
to see this a little bit. to bundle 2 r 3 
r 

371
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,480
5 so we summarize everything that 

372
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,600
goes 2 minus 2 is 0 plus 9 is 

373
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,060
simply the 9 that means we know 5 

374
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,000
r plus 9 is equal to 19 that is, as 

375
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,260
I said, a completely normal equation 

376
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,420
as we already 

377
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,620
know it from the lower level so we simply 

378
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,820
transform it to er so minus 9 is there 5 r 

379
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,760
is equal to 10 and last but not least 

380
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
divided by 5 and And then 

381
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,060
we come to R is equal to 2. that means 

382
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,900
that this result, which is below here 

383
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,620
, must always be interpreted. 

384
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,020
In our case, R is 2, which 

385
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,720
means that we have an unambiguous 

386
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,840
solution. And that means that there 

387
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,280
is an intersection point. 

388
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,700
We can now calculate this point of 
intersection 

389
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,500
simply by substituting the R above into 

390
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,780
the equation of the line. So 

391
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,700
R is equal to 2. Let's enter 

392
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,480
123 plus 2 times 1 plus 

393
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,780
123 plus 2 times 101. 1 plus 2 times 1 

394
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,360
is 3, 2 plus 2 times 0 is 2, 3 plus 2 

395
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,820
times 1 is 5. This means that the 

396
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,280
intersection point is at the vector 3, 2, 

397
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,820
5 or at the point 3, 2, 5 

398
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,020
if you write them next to each other. 

399
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
The other two possibilities, 

400
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,960
straight line is part of the plane and 
straight line 

401
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,120
is parallel to the plane, are expressed 

402
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
as follows: if you end up 

403
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,700
with a true statement here , but your 

404
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,200
parameter has been omitted, i.e. 

405
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,660
at the end it says something like 0 is 

406
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,080
equal to 0 or 5 is equal to 5 or 10 

407
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,300
is equal to 10, in any case a true 

408
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,820
statement, then there are an infinite 
number of 

409
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,640
common points, i.e. the 

410
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,620
straight line lies in the plane or is 

411
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,100
part of the plane. If you 

412
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,880
get a statement that is not true, i.e. 

413
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,860
zero equals 95 equals 

414
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,000
one or three equals minus three 

415
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,920
, then you have no solution, i.e. 

416
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,060
the straight line is parallel to the 

417
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,560
plane and there are no common 

418
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,080
points, so that's how to interpret it and 

419
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,500
you can 

420
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,240
get a result quite quickly with a 
calculation. 

421
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,360
You just have to know how to 

422
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,100
interpret it. That is very important. 
Well, 

423
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,300
let's finish with the 

424
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,720
positional relationship between two 
planes. 

425
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
There are also 

426
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,240
three possible positions between two 
planes . One is 

427
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,200
parallel, one is identical and one is 
intersecting 

428
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,780
. It is important to note that two planes 

429
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,580
do not have 

430
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,480
an intersection point, but an 

431
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,260
intersection line. If you 

432
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,280
allow two planes to intersect, as you can 
see 

433
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,960
below, an intersection line is created. 

434
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,900
And you want to 

435
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,240
be able to calculate and specify this 
intersection line . 

436
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,200
So we'll 

437
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,460
do that in a moment. As I said, these are 
the 

438
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,600
three possibilities: parallel, 

439
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,580
identical or intersection line. We 

440
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,120
will now deal with the case where 

441
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,080
you 

442
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,520

443
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,200
are given a plane in coordinate form and 
one in parameter form. This is the best 

444
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,460
way to 

445
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,400
calculate the positional relationship , 
simply because the 

446
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,700
coordinate form is the easiest. 

447
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,140
Well, we see here above... Above 

448
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,180
, a plane equation 

449
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,640
in parameter form and here a 

450
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,520
plane equation in coordinate form. 

451
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,500
We now simply 

452
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,980

453
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,640
insert the plane that is given to us in 
parameter form into the coordinate form. 

454
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,960
So in our case , we insert E1 into E2 

455
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,140
. E1 is simply 

456
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,560
given in parameter form and we 

457
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,720

458
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,740
always insert the plane that is given in 
parameter form into the plane 

459
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,340
that is given in coordinate form. 

460
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,480
Again, the top here is 

461
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,220
the x-rope, this is the y-rope 

462
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,980
and this is the z-rope. So 

463
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,000
we end up with 2 times 1 plus r minus 1 
times 8r 

464
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,620
plus 2s plus 3 times 1 plus s and that 

465
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,560
equals 5. And you can 

466
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,020
already see that we have two unknown 

467
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,500
r and s here and the problem is that we 

468
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,660
only have one equation here. That 

469
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,780
means we can 

470
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,920
't actually solve it. We are now solving 
it as a 

471
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,880
function of one... of the two 

472
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,980
variables. 

473
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,260
So either we change it to R or we change 
it to S. 

474
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,440
It doesn't matter how we do it. 

475
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,300
In this case, we have decided to 

476
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,980
convert it to S. As 

477
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,000
I said, we could just as 

478
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,620
easily have done it according to R. Well, 

479
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,000
let's do it the same way as we just did 
and 

480
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,940
exclude it first. So 2 times 1 

481
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,620
is 2, 2 times R is 2R, minus 1 times 8R 

482
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,700
is minus 8R, minus 1 times S is minus 

483
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,280
S, 3 times 1 is 3, 3 times S is 3s. 

484
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,040
So we see here that 2r minus 8r 

485
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,840
is minus 6r, minus s plus 3s is 2s and 

486
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,780
2 plus 3 is 5. That equals 5. 

487
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,240
We want to get rid of the 5 first, 

488
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,160
so we calculate minus 5 and then 

489
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,540
all that's left is minus 6r plus 2s 

490
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,960
equals 0. That's why we 

491
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,560
change it right away and bring the 6r 
over. 

492
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
That's why we also calculate plus 

493
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,400
6r. we get 2s is equal to 6r and 

494
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,140
now we just have to 

495
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,840
divide by two to get s and then 

496
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,760
we get s is equal to 3r that 

497
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
's our result and I' 

498
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
ve just said that we 

499
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,720

500
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,120
most probably have an intersection line we 
now know 

501
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,060
in any case that we 

502
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,500
have an intersection line with the result 

503
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,920
yes so whenever you get something like 
this 

504
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,300
S is equal to 3R, then you have 

505
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,480
an intersection line and we now use 

506
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,340
3R for the S. 

507
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,300
We have our parameter S here and 

508
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,400
we now enter 3R for this parameter S, 

509
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,240
because we know that S equals 3R 

510
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,320
and that's how we get from here to here. 

511
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,560
So 1 0 1 plus R times 1 8 0 plus 3 

512
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,080
times R times 0 1 1. And 

513
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,420
now we want to try to turn these two 

514
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,120
vectors into one. To 

515
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,300
be able to do this, we 

516
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,680
first have to put the 

517
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,860
parameter in front of both of them , i.e. 

518
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,960
R in our case 

519
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,280
. 3R is currently still on the right here. 
Therefore, we drag the 3 into the 

520
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,920
vector. This means that we have to 

521
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,780

522
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,880
multiply all the elements in the vector by 
a factor of 3. So 3 times 0 

523
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,980
is 0, 3 times 1 is 3 and 3 times 1 is 

524
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,180
also 3 here. we come down here 

525
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,800
and we now see we have 101 

526
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,720
plus r times 180 plus r times 033 we 

527
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,280
multiply this vector and 

528
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
this vector by r, i.e. the same 

529
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,700
factor, so we can 

530
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,940
add the two vectors together, i.e. 1 plus 
0 is 1, 

531
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,020
8 plus 3 is 11 and 0 plus 3 is 3 

532
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,200
and so we arrive at 101 plus r times 

533
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,720
113 and that is 

534
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,700
our intersection map This is how you 
determine 

535
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,180
an intersection line. So whenever 

536
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
a result 

537
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,080
follows from the calculation here , 
something like S is equal to 3R 

538
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,840
or S is equal to 0, you have 

539
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,740
an intersection line . This means that the 
planes 

540
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,220
intersect. The other 

541
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,700
possibilities are that 

542
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
both parameters are omitted 

543
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,940
and a true statement is obtained. Then 

544
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,820
the two planes are identical. 

545
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,860
If you get a non-true statement 

546
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,080
or no solution, then 

547
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,700
the planes are simply parallel. This is 
how 

548
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,960
to interpret it. Here are 

549
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,640
two more examples of how to 

550
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,800

551
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,720
calculate the degrees of intersection from 
the solution. This is often 

552
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,220
a small sticking point. That's why 

553
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,560
we'll deal with it again here. 

554
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,080
We now see the case where S 

555
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,300
is 0. In other words, we put 

556
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,780
a 0 in here for the S and so 

557
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,920
1, 0, 1 plus r 

558
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,940
times 1, 4, 0 plus 0 times, 

559
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,080
we now have the S , we know that S is 
equal to 

560
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,560
0, which is why it says 0 times 0, 1, 1. 

561
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
This is a very simple case, then 

562
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,280
this is completely omitted here, because 0 

563
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,660
times the vector is 0, therefore 

564
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,560
the intersection line is then 1, 0, 1 plus 
r 

565
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,260
times 1, 4, 0. The case that 

566
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,220
is the most difficult is 

567
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,660
actually shown here on the right, in which 
case 

568
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,840
S is now equal to 2 plus r. And 

569
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,940
of course we first use this for S 

570
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,900
and then it becomes 

571
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,000
more difficult in the sense that you 

572
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,780
have to pull it apart. So we 

573
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,340
have 1, 0, 1 plus R times 1, 4, 0 plus 

574
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,700
bracket to 2 plus R bracket to times 

575
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,620
0, 1, 1. In order to 

576
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,440
resolve this bracket here, we have to 

577
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,180

578
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,660
multiply the vector here by 2 once and 

579
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,160
multiply it by R once. The vector here 

580
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,140
multiplied by 2 is 2 times 0, 0, 2 times 

581
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,800
1, 2 and 2 times 1, 2 This is the 

582
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,200
vector here multiplied by 2 

583
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,140
And of course the vector times R 

584
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,480
and so there plus R times the 

585
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,000
vector you get 1, 0, 1 

586
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,300
plus R times 1, 4, 0 plus 0, 2, 2 As 

587
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,680
I said, this was created by the fact that 

588
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,020
we multiplied by 2 

589
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,560
plus R times 0, 1, 1, that by 2 

590
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,060
this vector here we can 

591
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,540
now 

592
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,140
calculate directly with the support vector 
so 1 plus 0 1 0 plus 2 2 

593
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,740
1 plus 23 and as we did before 

594
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,000
the two vectors 

595
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,140
here are both multiplied by r 

596
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,680
therefore we can 

597
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,140
add the vectors so 1 plus 0 14 plus plus 1 

598
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,460
is 5 and 0 plus 1 is 1. Consequently, 

599
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,600
in this case the 

600
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,480
intersection line is 1, 2, 3 plus r times 
1, 

601
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,120
5, 1. And these are actually all the 

602
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,540
cases that exist. That brings us to 

603
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,260
the end of the webinar. 

604
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,020
Thank you very much for your 

605
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,820
attention.
