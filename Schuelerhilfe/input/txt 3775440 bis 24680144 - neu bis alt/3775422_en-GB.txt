00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,300
Hello, my name is Sabrina and I 

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,860
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,260
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
give you 

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,400
an insight into the topic of cation, 

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,360
anion and noble gas configuration. 

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,780
Of course, you can 

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,360
also find a wiki on this topic in our 
online 

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,440
 learning center. The 

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,300
important and basic terms  are 

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,660
explained  there once again. With ions 

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,840
, a distinction is made between negatively 
charged 

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,500
ions, the anions, and the positively 

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,460
charged cations. Ions 

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,980
are formed from atoms by giving up 

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,780
or taking up electrons . The atoms of all 

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,520
elements strive to have a 

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
completely filled outer shell 

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,780
, as is the case 

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,560

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,960
with noble gases, the elements of the 
eighth main group. This is often 

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,340

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,580
referred to as the octet rule or the 
eight-electron rule. This striving 

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,500
has an effect on the reactivity and 

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,740
electronegativity of the elements. 

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,200
With a full outer shell, the 

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,860
particles are energetically very stable 

27
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,320
, which is why they form compounds to 

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,580
achieve this state. 

29
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,200
The only elements that do not 

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
strive for compounds and 

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
are therefore extremely inert are the 

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,820
noble gases themselves. They naturally 
have 

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,320
a full outer shell. The 

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,820
electronegativity just mentioned is the 

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,220
relative measure of an 

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,980
atom 's ability to attract electrons 

37
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,100
to itself in a bond. The elements of the 

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,880
seventh main group, 

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,500
called halogens , have seven 

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,980
outer electrons, which means that 

41
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,060
they are only missing one electron each to 

42
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,920
reach the desired state 

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,280
. 

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,560
These elements are correspondingly 
reactive . They have high 

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,520
electronegativities and are 

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,200
already found in bimolecular form, 

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,420
i.e. they share 

48
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,420
two electrons in an electron pair bond 

49
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,660
, which 

50
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,600

51
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,120
puts them in a stable state corresponding 
to the noble gas configurations. 

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,100
However, if the halogens are allowed to 
react with other 

53
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,600
elements of lower 

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200
electronegativity, for 

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,480
example with metals, the 

56
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,320
halogens strip the metal atoms, the 

57
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,820
outer electrons, and become 

58
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,100
anions, the negatively charged ions. 

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,660
The metal atoms become cations 

60
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,420
, the positively charged ions. 

61
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,460
In this way, both atoms, 

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,180
the halogen and the metal atom, reach the 

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,260
noble gas configuration. If we look 

64
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,340
at the reaction of sodium and 

65
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,140
chlorine to form sodium chloride 

66
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,720
, we can see that a chlorine atom 

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,300
rips an electron away from a sodium atom. 

68
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,120
This gives chlorine the 

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,920
electron configuration of argon and 

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,340
sodium the configuration of neon. 

71
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,200
Ion formation is followed by 

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,420

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,520
ionic bonding due to the different 
charges. Cation and anion 

74
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,260
attract each other and form a 

75
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,500
salt crystal. This is spatially 

76
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
structured like a solid lattice, in which 

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,740
a chloride ion 

78
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,780

79
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,980
is surrounded in all directions by a total 
of six neighboring sodium ions and 

80
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,300
vice versa. Although there 

81
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,920
are no 

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,580
covalent bonds, i.e. 

83
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,840
atomic bonds, between sodium and chloride 
ions , the 

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,740
electrostatic attraction between 

85
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,220
them is very strong and leads to a 

86
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,400
high melting temperature of approx. 800°C 

87
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,160
in a rigid structure. 

88
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,140
Sodium chloride, like salts in general, is 

89
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,540
highly soluble in water, as 

90
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,460
water is a polar solvent 

91
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,000
and forms so-called hydrate oils 

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,460
around the ions. The partially positively 

93
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,080
charged side of each water molecule 

94
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
in the vicinity of a chloride ion aligns 

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,280
itself with the ion. 

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,580
The partially negatively charged side 

97
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,200
points away from it. The positively 
charged 

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,540
sodium ion is 

99
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,440
hydrated in the same way. The partially 
negatively 

100
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,360
charged side of each adjacent 

101
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,000
water particle points towards the ion 

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,320
, while the partially positively 

103
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,540
charged sides point away from it 

104
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,740
. During ion formation, 

105
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,380
halogens take up 1 electron each 

106
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,940
, the elements of the 6th main group, 

107
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,780
the chalcogens, take up 2 electrons each, 

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
the elements of the 5th main group, the 

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,600
nitrogen group elements take up 3 

110
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,020
electrons each, in order to 

111
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,340

112
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,600
reach the configuration of the next noble 
gas in the period . Their ions are 

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,280
therefore negatively charged. The 

114
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,640
elements of the first 3 main groups 

115
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,600
tend to 

116
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,160
give up electrons in order to reach the 
configuration of the 

117
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,500
noble gas in the previous period 

118
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,000
. Their ions are then 

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,660
positively charged. Observing the 

120
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,300
main groups in which the 

121
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,420
bonding partners are located helps 

122
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,220
to establish the correct 

123
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,460
ratio formula of a neck or 

124
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,700
a compound. For example, elements 

125
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,800
of the first main group bind elements of 
the 

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,220
seventh main group in a ratio of 1 

127
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,900
to 1, as already seen in the example of 

128
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,680
sodium chloride. 

129
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,360
Elements of the second main group 

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,100
also bind elements of the sixth in a ratio 
of 1 to 1. 

132
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,540
Elements of the second main group 

133
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,980
bind elements of the seventh in a 

134
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,680
ratio of 1 to 2. Elements of the 

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,540
first main group bind elements 

136
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,600
of the sixth in a ratio of 2 to 1. 

137
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,040
Elements of the third main group 

138
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,020
bind elements of the seventh in a ratio of 

139
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,300
1 to 3. Elements of the first main group 

140
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,400
bind elements of the fifth in a ratio of 

141
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,620
3 to 2. Elements of the third main group 

142
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,620
bind elements of the sixth in a ratio of 

143
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,080
2 to 3. And elements of the second 

144
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,660
main group bind elements of the fifth in a 

145
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,880
ratio of 3 to 2. Thank you for 

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,100
your attention. I hope the 

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,620
video has helped you to better 

148
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,200
understand the topic of cation, anion 

149
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,800
and noble gas configuration 

150
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,100
and enables you to 

151
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,460

152
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,460
set up ratio formulas correctly . Thank 
you 

153
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,100
for watching and see you next time!
