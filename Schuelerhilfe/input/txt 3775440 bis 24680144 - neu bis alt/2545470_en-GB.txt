00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,070
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,370
Integral areas and 

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,850
rotational volumes. In 

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,230
this webinar , we will talk about areas 

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,970
under functions, i.e. between the 

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,030
function graphs and the x-axis, and 

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,890
at the very end about 

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,270
volumes of rotation. To do this, 

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,570
we will start by 

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,150
looking at integrals again , i.e. 

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,070
certain integrals and the 

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,750
geometric interpretation of a 

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,210
certain integral and thus 

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,390
integrals in general, 

15
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,290
and then we will 

16
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,850
have one or two application tasks on how 

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,170
to 

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,750
determine areas under graphs and then at 
the end 

19
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,470
we will 

20
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,810
look at the volumes of rotation. Well, 
let's start again very 

21
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,790
quickly with a brief review 

22
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,010
. Definite integrals, a 

23
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,410
definite integral is characterized 

24
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,750
by the fact that it 

25
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,110
has an upper and a lower limit. A is the 

26
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,390
lower limit, B is the upper limit and 

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,010
such an integral can be solved by 

28
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,210

29
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,610

30
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,410

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,310
calculating the antiderivative f of b, 
i.e. the upper limit, minus the 
antiderivative f of a, i.e. the lower 
limit. This is 

32
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,590
also due to the main theorem of 

33
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,970
differential and integral calculus 

34
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,650

35
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,590
, as explained in the previous webinar. It 
is very important 

36
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,450
that the function 

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,910
is continuous. It must not have any gaps, 

38
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,310
as is the case here, or in other words, 

39
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,590
this is 

40
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,170
not possible for fractional rational 
functions or only in 

41
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,510
the interval where 

42
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,870
there is no interruption or no definition 
gap. 

43
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,590
But this is almost always the case. So 

44
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,090
we must always have something like this, 
the 

45
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,030
graph must not have a gap and 

46
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,870
then we can also 

47
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,010
determine the area in between. 

48
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,250
The area 

49
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,070
between the graph and the x-axis is always 

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,950
calculated. And this area is 

51
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,630
delimited by the upper or 

52
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,730
lower limit, i.e. in the interval a, 

53
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,650
b. This means that the area 

54
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,430
starts at point a and ends at 

55
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,770
point b, if you like. 

56
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,870
A special case is, of course, if 

57
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,950
we want to start at 0. 

58
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,570
This is then the so-called 

59
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,390
antiderivative function, which goes from 0 
to x 

60
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,390
or from 0 to b, i.e. f from b. And 

61
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,530
as I said, this is a special case. 

62
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,490
This is also called 

63
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,550
the area content function if 

64
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,610
the a is 0, as is the case with the 

65
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,660
antiderivative function. Here 

66
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,920
we have a small example. 

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,100
We are to calculate the area 

68
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,120
between the function and the x-axis 

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,980
. And the function is f 

70
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,740
of x is equal to 2x² plus 2. The 

71
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,560
interval is 0 to 2. This means that 

72
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,280
we have exactly this 

73
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,100
special case just mentioned, that 

74
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,000
we start at 0 and end at 2. 

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,700
We therefore take the 

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,000
area content function, i.e. 

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
the antiderivative. So the integral from 

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,740
a to b of the function f of x dx 

79
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,380
is then simply f of b, because our 

80
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,600
a is 0. This means that our 

81
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,660
antiderivative, where we 

82
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,580
insert the b , is our 

83
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,420
area content function A of b. 

84
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,880
So we first integrate 

85
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,480
our function 2x² plus 2, i.e. the 

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,900
integral from 0 to 2 of 2x² plus 2. 

87
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,400
This is integrated 2 thirds x to the power 
of 3 

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
plus 2x. And because we only 

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,660
have the upper limit 2 and the lower 

90
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,380
limit is 0, we only need to 

91
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,780
use x equal to 2, i.e. the upper 

92
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,960
limit. This gives us 2 thirds 

93
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,120
times 2 to the power of 3 plus 2 times 2. 
That's 

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,860
28 thirds. In other words, we know that 

95
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,400
we have 

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,120
enclosed an area of 28 thirds. The whole 
thing 

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,500
can then be interpreted in this way, even 

98
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,800
if it is slightly shifted here. 

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,480
So the area should or the 

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,700
area is to be found here. This is where 
the 

101
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,930
area is located and we have 

102
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,870
just calculated it. 

103
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,110
Of course, it looks a little different 

104
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,130
if we suddenly 

105
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,990
have an upper and a lower limit, such as 

106
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,070
1 and 3 here. As you 

107
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,010
have probably already seen , we 

108
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,350
also have a different functional equation 
here , 

109
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,850
x²-4. And you proceed in almost 

110
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,010
exactly the same way. First, we 

111
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,930
insert the two limits, 1 and 3, which 
means that 

112
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,450
in this case we calculate 

113
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,710
the integral from 1 to 3 of the function 

114
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,230
f of x dx. In other words, we take the 

115
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,550
antiderivative of the upper limit 

116
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,210
minus the antiderivative of the 

117
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,450
lower limit. Yes, that's what we see 

118
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,110
here. Integral from 1 to 3 of 

119
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,570
the function x² plus 2x dx. First, 

120
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,510
we simply form the antiderivative 

121
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,790
or integrate the 

122
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,330
whole thing. x² is integrated 1 third x 

123
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,170
to the power of 3 and 2 is integrated 
minus 2x. 

124
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,150
And that in the limits 1 to 3. You 

125
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,570
can see that this time both limits are 

126
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,130
still here, because there was just a 0, 

127
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,230
so we saved ourselves the trouble. 

128
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,030
In this case, there are just two limits. 
Now 

129
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,530
it's simply upper limit minus 

130
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,350
lower limit, i.e. f of b minus f 

131
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,830
of a This gives us 1 third times 

132
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,570
3 to the power of 3 plus 2 times 3 minus 1 
third 

133
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,590
times 1 plus 2 times 1 So as I said, 

134
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,190
always use 3 here for the upper limit 

135
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,830
and 1 here for the lower limit 

136
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,810
It's best to 

137
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,010
always put the second terms in brackets, 
otherwise 

138
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,150
you' ll have to change the signs 
immediately, 

139
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,030
if you don't do this, my advice 

140
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,530
to you is to always put them in brackets 
and 

141
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,310
then calculate them at the end in 

142
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,590
this case, we end up with an 

143
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,450
area of 40 thirds the 

144
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,770
whole thing is then located as we 

145
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,850
see here, i.e. from 1 to 3 so 

146
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,370
directly below here is 

147
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,850
our area yes you can see here 

148
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,130
very nicely it is 

149
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,410
limited here by the 1 and by the 3 below 

150
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,230
the graph of the x-axis. 

151
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,670
Now let's move on to a task that 

152
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,870
also occurs very often and that 

153
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,830
may 

154
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,230

155
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,730
sound very difficult if you haven't done 
it before. This is the 

156
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,150
area between two 

157
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,350
functions. To 

158
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,650
calculate this area , we first need 

159
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,290
the difference function and 

160
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,110
, of course, we have to 

161
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,150
calculate the limits. We want to 

162
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,490
do all of that right away. 

163
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,690
You should always use absolute value 
dashes for such problems 

164
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,530
, simply because it often 

165
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,570
happens that a negative 

166
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,950
area results and 

167
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,430
the absolute value dashes make it 

168
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,150
positive. 

169
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,500
Well, here we have such a 

170
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,080
task. We have 

171
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,800
the function g of x in green and the 

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
function f of x in blue . f of x minus x² 

173
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,700
plus 3 half x plus 4 and g of x 1 

174
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,920
half x² plus 1. And we are now supposed to 

175
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,920

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,040
calculate the area enclosed between these 
two graphs . We can see here 

178
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,820
that we could 

179
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,580
read off the intersection points , minus 1 
and 2, 

180
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,540
but this is not popular in mathematics 

181
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,980
. Therefore, we first have to 

182
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,820
determine the limits, 

183
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,620
or the intersection points. 

184
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,940
And we do this simply by 

185
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,060

186
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,700
equating the two functional equations . 
Quite normally, the 

187
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,520
point of intersection between two 

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
functions, i.e. f of x is equal to g 

189
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,880
of x. So minus x² plus 3 half x 

190
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,640
plus 4 equals 1 half x² plus 1. 

191
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,340
And we now 

192
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,200
simply have to solve this equation . The 
easiest 

193
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,260
thing to do is to convert it to the normal 
form 

194
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,000
, i.e. x² minus x minus 2, and 

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
then insert it into the PQ formula or 

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,280
the midnight formula, 

197
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,700
depending on what you are better at or 

198
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,320
perhaps 

199
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,460
simply solve it with the calculator, 

200
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,800
depending on what you are allowed to do 
and 

201
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,060
what you can do. Well, we then have 

202
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,900
the two solutions, minus 1 and 2, 

203
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,020
and these are also our 

204
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,740
limits. The minus 1 is then our 

205
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,880
lower limit A and the 2 is our 

206
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,700
upper limit B. This means that we 

207
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,340
now have the area is the 

208
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,440
amount of the integral from a to b of f 

209
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,540
of x minus g of x. 

210
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,460
As I said, you 

211
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,100
always calculate or subtract 

212
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,560
the two functions f from x and g 

213
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,340
from x in the integral. And that's what 
we've 

214
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,060
just done here. In the limits 

215
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,080
minus 1 to 2 minus x² plus 3 half x 

216
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,660
plus 4 minus 1 half x² plus 1. Again, 

217
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
the advice to you is to put it 

218
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,720
in brackets first and then 

219
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,760
simplify it. Minus x² minus 1 half 

220
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,020
x² is minus 3 half x² and plus 4 

221
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,840
minus 1 is just a plus 3 and 

222
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,760
then this is just the 

223
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,220
function that we have to integrate. 

224
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,740
The first thing we do now is to form 

225
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,720
the antiderivative. Minus 3 half x² 

226
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,500
integrated is minus 1 half x to the power 
of 3 

227
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,300
and plus 3 half x integrated is 3 

228
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,020
quarter x². The 3 simply get an 

229
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,520
x, so we get 3x and 

230
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
we have already 

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,700
completed the integration. And the whole 
thing happens 

232
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,740
in the limits minus 1 to 2. 

233
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,540
And we've actually already 

234
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,620
done the hardest part. 

235
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,000
All we have to do now is 

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,900
calculate the upper limit minus the lower 
limit. We do the 

237
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,300
same here. So we use 

238
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,020
2 as the upper limit and minus 

239
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,900
1 as the lower limit. This brings 

240
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,100
us to 5 minus minus 7 quarters. 

241
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,280
Here, too, the wheel equation is in 

242
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,620
brackets and you can see that minus minus 

243
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,600
is plus, which brings us to 

244
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,240
27 quarters. And that 

245
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,800
completes the task. So 

246
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,480
we have 

247
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,720
calculated this area. 

248
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,430
Let's move on to the next topic, 

249
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,650
improper integrals . And we'll 

250
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,350
start with an example. 

251
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,110
Let's assume that we make 

252
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,130
an infinite number of squares. And 

253
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,250
this is as follows: the next 

254
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,650
square is always only a 

255
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,730
quarter of the area of the current 

256
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,090
square. In other words, a quarter of the 

257
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,210
area is now only half as 

258
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,250
high. And the question now is, how 

259
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,890
large is the resulting area? 

260
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,610
So how big will the area be? We 

261
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,590
have to keep extending this. The 

262
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,950
first idea is, of course, to 

263
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,770
build a triangle around it. And 

264
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,690
then the area is nothing 

265
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,410
more than a. is equal to a times b 

266
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,810
halves. But that is nothing more than 

267
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,850
an estimate. As I said, that's 

268
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,630
not the truth, it's just a 

269
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,530
rough estimate. 

270
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,850
It doesn't always work, 

271
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:17,710
and this 

272
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,330
example doesn't work 

273
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,710
for all functions. We have 

274
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,590

275
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,030
picked out two functions here where it 
does 

276
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,810
and doesn't work. 

277
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,090
First, let' s take a look at the E 
function, where 

278
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,850
it works. 

279
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,990
We want to 

280
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,830

281
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,990
calculate the integral between 0 and 
infinity of the function e raised to the 
power of minus x. It's very important to 
note 

282
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,450
that something to the power of 0 is always 
1. 

283
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,990
This means that we start with 1 and then 

284
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,710
we ask ourselves, e to the power of minus 

285
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,950
infinity, or the 

286
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,830
integral of e to the power of minus 
infinity, 

287
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,770
what is that? Sorry, the 

288
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,590
integral from 0 to infinity of the 

289
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,830
function e raised to the power of minus x. 

290
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,710
You'll 

291
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,310
see why I made a mistake in a moment . 
First, let's 

292
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,790
use our limits of integration and what 

293
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,230
's very important here is that e raised to 
the power of minus x 

294
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,270
is integrated minus e raised to the power 
of minus x. 

295
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,970
That's why I 

296
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,290
made such a mistake. In other words, in 
the end it 

297
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,550
really says minus e to the power of minus 

298
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,410
infinity. e to the power of minus infinity 
is 

299
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,110
approximately 0. That means it' 

300
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,110
s approximately 1. 

301
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,360
So the area between 0 and 

302
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,400
infinity is approximately 1. That's what 
it says 

303
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,040
here. Because simply 

304
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,000
minus e to the power of minus infinity is 

305
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,020
approximately 0. A second example where 

306
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,680
this doesn't work is simply x to the power 
of 

307
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,000
minus 1. Because if we now 

308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,920
insert the 1 here , we simply have 1 to 
the power of 

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,180
minus 1, which is simply 1, okay, 

310
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,920
we can still do that, and infinity 

311
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,540
to the power of minus 1, unfortunately 
that 

312
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,600
doesn't work , or rather we have to 

313
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
integrate it and then we will 

314
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,420
find that it no longer 

315
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,560
works. We can see that 

316
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,900
here for now. First of all, let's go 

317
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,900
and insert our limits and we 

318
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,060
suddenly have the logarithm of 

319
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,920
x, i.e. we have 

320
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,000
the logarithm of x as an 

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,300
antiderivative function in the limits 1 to 
b 

322
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,060
or 1 to infinity, if you 

323
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,240
like. And the logarithm of 

324
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
infinity is unfortunately infinite. 

325
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,460
This is simply due to the fact that the 

326
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,280
logarithm function increases continuously, 

327
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,420
albeit very slowly. And therefore 

328
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,520
no value is set or it 

329
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,070
approaches no value. This brings us to 

330
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,150
the last 

331
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,310
topic for today. These are the 

332
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,130
rotation volumes. Yes, 

333
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,090
rotation volumes are simply 

334
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,170
bodies that are created by rotating them 

335
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,970
around the x-axis or the y-axis 

336
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,290
. Of course, the whole thing 

337
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,630
also takes place in an interval. 

338
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,390
And as I said, there are two cases, 

339
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,010
either 

340
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,810
rotating along the x-axis or rotating 
along the y-axis 

341
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,310
. 

342
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,510

343
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,650
Rotating along the x-axis is 

344
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,830
of course easier, but rotating along the 
y-axis 

345
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,690
is also not too 

346
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,150
difficult. the whole thing is of course 

347
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,110
based on the fact that if you 

348
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,910
let it rotate , a circular surface is 
created here 

349
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,810
and the function equation of course 

350
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,110
changes this edge here, so 

351
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,970
if, for example, you 

352
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,450

353
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,450
were to incorporate a function like this , 
the edge would 

354
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,870
look like this the area of this 

355
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,610
surface for the cut surface is 

356
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,990
still always pi times R², where our 

357
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,490
R is our function equation. So 

358
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,830
we arrive at the approach, V of X 

359
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,950
is equal to Pi times our integral from 

360
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,670
A to B, F² of X dx, that is, we 

361
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,030
square our function, this is 

362
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,450
simply due to the fact that the 

363
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,910
function value at each point represents 
the 

364
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,070
radius at each point. 

365
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,190
With FV of Y it's a bit 

366
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,430
easier, er, it's a bit 

367
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,550
more complicated. Here 

368
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,850
again , we have pi times the integral from 
a to 

369
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,070
b of f raised to the power of minus 1. 
This means that we 

370
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,010
need the inverse function of 

371
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,390
x squared again. This means 

372
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,550
that if we rotate around the y-axis 

373
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,870
, we only need to 

374
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,870
form the inverse function. In other words, 
we have to 

375
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,610
rearrange the function equation according 
to x. 

376
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,980
Let's start with an 

377
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,720
example . 

378
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,220
The first thing we want to do is rotate 
around the x-axis. 

379
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,320
As just mentioned, this is the 

380
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,600
simpler case. We have the 

381
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,200
function f of x is equal to 1.5x² and 

382
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,420
we want the volume of rotation in 

383
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,480
an interval from 0 to 1. And that 

384
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,140
's quite simple. v of x is then 

385
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,120
equal to pi times the integral of a to 

386
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,060
b of the function f of x² dx. 

387
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,140
In other words, we simply 

388
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,360
insert our function here. So pi times 

389
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,240
the integral from 0 to 1 of 1.5x² 

390
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,140
to the power of 2 dx. x. Now it is very 
important that 

391
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,580
when we solve this bracket here, we 

392
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,980
have to square the 1 half once, 

393
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,360
which is then 1 quarter and 

394
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,060
square the x. It is very important to 
remember 

395
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,680

396
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,760
that when you raise a power , you multiply 
it, 

397
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
power laws. This means we calculate 

398
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,520
2 times 2, which is not 2 plus 2, very 

399
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,860
important. So we arrive at x to the power 
of 4. 

400
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,880
2 times 2 2 is 4, so x to the power of 4. 
And 

401
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,040
we can already see that this 

402
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,620
is almost through the number. We 

403
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,680
now have pi times the integral from 0 

404
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,300
to 1 and 1, 1 quarter x to the power of 4 
dx. 

405
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,500
We now integrate this 

406
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,600
as normal. Then we arrive at pi times 1 

407
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,680
twentieth x to the power of 5 in the 
limits 0 

408
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
to 1. The limit 0 is then 

409
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,340
0 again. If we 

410
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,620
insert the limit 0 , we get a 0 again. 

411
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,940
This means that we actually only have to 

412
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,960
look at the limit 1 and that is 

413
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,820
then simply pi times 1 twentieth. 

414
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,840
That is approximately 0.16 

415
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,560
volume units. That is the volume 

416
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,620
of this body of revolution. The volume 

417
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,960
is so small because it's a very 

418
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,760
small interval. 

419
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,600
Right, now let's 

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,180
continue with the second example problem. 

421
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,360
In this case, we are rotating around the 
y-axis 

422
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,560
. Here we see that Vy 

423
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,140
is equal to pi times a in the 

424
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,080
change integral from a to b of f 

425
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,440
raised to the power of minus 1x squared 
dx. 

426
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,280
This means that the first thing we have to 
do here is to 

427
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,360
form the inverse function. In other words, 
we 

428
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,580
convert to x. We know that y 

429
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,240
is equal to 1 third x squared. 

430
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,780
If we multiply by 3, we get 3y 

431
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,200
equals x squared. If we take the 

432
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,340
roots, then we know that x is 

433
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,760
equal to the square root of 3y. y. To 

434
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,020

435
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,620
keep our variable simple, we now 

436
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,560
simply swap x and y so that we still 

437
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,020
have an x. And so we arrive at 

438
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,220
the root of 3x is y. This gives 

439
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,420
us our inverse function. And this 

440
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,300
is now simply our f raised to the power of 
minus 

441
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,140
1. And so we arrive at vy 

442
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,380
equals pi times the integral from 0 to 

443
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,580
4 of the square root of 3x. This is 

444
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,720
of course quite simple now. The 

445
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,740
square root of 3x is simply 

446
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,940
3x. Because root and square cancel each 
other 

447
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,900
out. And so we arrive at pi times 

448
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,860
the integral from 0 to 4 of 3x dx. 

449
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,860
3x dx, i.e. 3x integrated 

450
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,980
by x, is nothing more than 3 half 

451
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
x squared. And the whole thing in the 

452
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,840
limits 0 to 4. 0 is 

453
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,100
0 again. This means that we 

454
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,480
only have to insert 4. Then we calculate 

455
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,560
4 times 3 halves times 4 to the power of 
2. Then 

456
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,580
we arrive at 24 pi or a volume 

457
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,560
of 75.4 volumes. 

458
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,780
And that' s it for integrals. 

459
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,740
I hope you enjoyed the webinar 

460
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,400
and I hope you have a 

461
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,000
nice evening.
