Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,340
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,360
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,260
something about protein biosynthesis 

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,140
. In our online 

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,940
 learning center, you 

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,300
can of course also find a wiki on this 
topic 

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,500
, in which the 

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,400
basic and important terms 

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,280
are explained in more detail. Protein 

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,880
 biosynthesis is the process 

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,280
by which proteins 

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,420

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,040
are produced or synthesized . Protein 
biosynthesis 

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,080
consists of two fundamental 

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,580
components, transcription and 

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,420
translation. Transcription 

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,040
describes the process in which an 

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,220
mRNA is formed from DNA. It takes place 

20
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,300
in the cell nucleus. This 

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,400
process can be roughly 

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,220
divided into three parts. The 

23
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,740
initialization of transcription, i.e. 

24
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,940
its beginning, the 

25
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,100
elongation phase and the end of 

26
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,720
transcription, i.e. the 

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,340
terminator . Transcription 

28
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,900
begins after the RNA polymerase 

29
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,380
, an enzyme that 

30
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,980
can synthesize RNA 

31
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,400

32
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,160
, has bound to the promoter, a special 
section of DNA. An enzyme called 

33
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,240
helicase splits the double strands of 

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,740
DNA into two single strands. 

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
As the strands are now exposed, 

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,660
new, 

37
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,660
complementary bases can attach to the 
template strand. As a result of 

38
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,680
their attachment, 

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,020
two 

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,780
new strands are formed from one strand 
during elongation . On the matrix strand, 

41
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,500
the elongation runs from 3' to 

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,580
5'. On the other strand, 

43
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,180
the extension runs from 5' in 

44
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,260
the 3' direction. Transcription 

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,300
is terminated at the terminator, a 
specific 

46
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,540
sequence on the DNA. 

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,740
In multicellular organisms 

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,000
, the mRNA then travels directly to 

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,140
the ribosomes. In multicellular 

50
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,040
organisms such as humans, the mRNA is 

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,900

52
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,320
processed before it leaves the cell 
nucleus . This 

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,440
process is called splicing and 

54
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,240
can 

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,920
largely change the information on the mRNA 
. In the next 

56
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
step, the mRNA then leaves the 

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
cell nucleus and enters the 

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,780
cytoplasm. 

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,260
An organelle called the ribosome is 
required for translation 

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,280
, in which the proteins 

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,300
are produced. If you compare protein 

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,480
 biosynthesis with a Lego building set, 

63
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,980
you can imagine that 

64
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,280
the 

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,820
instructions 

66
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,320
are created or copied in the transcription 
step. The ribosomes represent the 

67
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,340
respective pawn. The necessary 

68
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,980
parts, tRNAs, are located in the 

69
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,500
cytoplasm. But how exactly can these 

70
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,700
instructions be read? The DNA 

71
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,940
or mRNA is coded in so-called codons 

72
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,020
. This means that 

73
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,100
three base pairs always 

74
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
correspond to one amino acid. For example, 
the 

75
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,860
sequence guanine, cytosine and 

76
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,680
uracil corresponds to the amino acid 
alanine. Here is 

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,100
another overview of the 

78
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,940
most important aspects of the genetic 

79
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,760
code. The genetic code is 

80
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,020
comma-free. There are no separators 

81
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,560
between codons. Codons 

82
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,860
do not overlap each other. The 

83
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,800
genetic code is degenerate, 

84
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
several codons can 

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,400
encode the same amino acid. In addition, 
the 

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,440
genetic code is universal, i.e. 

87
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,180
identical in almost all living organisms . 
To 

88
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,020
synthesize a protein, it is not 

89
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,360
the DNA that is read, but the mRNA. 

90
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,880
There are two RNA binding sites on the 

91
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,520
ribosome. 

92
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,280
The mRNA attaches to the P site. 

93
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,740
The tRNA with the appropriate 

94
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,160
code is now located on the A site . The 
tRNA transports 

95
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,560
a specific amino acid on one side 

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
and 

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,200
the code complementary to mRNA is found on 
the other side. If 

98
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,860
the code of the tRNA 

99
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,160
is compatible with that of the mRNA 

100
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,880
, the respective amino acid is 

101
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,160
added to the amino acid chain. This is 
repeated 

102
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,420
until the ribosome 

103
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,440
comes to a stop. Codon, the stop signal, 
is 

104
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,660
encountered. This is where translation 
ends 

105
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,720
and the amino acid chain unwinds. 

106
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,260
The result of translation is 

107
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,260
a strand of amino acids. 

108
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,700
This strand changes and folds 

109
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,000
into a protein. 

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,260

111
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,760
A distinction is made between three 
different protein forms. The 

112
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,140
alpha, the beta and the gamma 

113
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,640
 structure. I hope that you now 

114
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
know more about protein biosynthesis 

115
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,300
. If you still have questions about these
