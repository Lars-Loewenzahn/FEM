1
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,050
So, let's get started. I 

2
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,990
am Serena. If you have any questions, 

3
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,150
please feel free to ask them 

4
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,030
during the webinar or 

5
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,050
at the end. Please ask anything you 

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,450
can, anything you have 

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,350
doubts about, anything you don't quite 

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,110
understand. It is very 

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,430
important to me that we 

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,870
leave here at the end and that you 

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,130
have understood the topic. And that's 
exactly what 

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,710
we're going to do now. Today, 

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,590
as I said, we're going to talk about 
bodies. 

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,410
And then let's get started. 

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,230
First of all, we'll discuss the 

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,470
units for calculating solids, then 

17
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,510
cubes, cuboids, general 

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,070
prisms, cylinders and, last but not least, 
we'll 

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,730

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,830
give you some examples. 

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,620
So, the very first topic we will discuss 

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,080
is the units of 

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,220
solid calculation. 

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,600
So, lengths of edges have simple 

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,180
units of length, for example 

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,060
centimetres or meters. So there 

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,300
is no square, no height 2, 

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,880
no height 3 or anything else. 

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,520
Exactly, when it comes to areas, 

30
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,800
they are calculated from a 

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,880
product of two lengths. So that means 

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,780
you have a length here and 

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,620
then a length here and then 

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,780
that becomes an area. 

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,340
This means that there is then a 

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,580
square length, i.e. meters to the power of 
2 

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,480
or centimeters to the power of 2, because 
you 

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,520
then multiply meters by 

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,700
meters and then it becomes 

40
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,500
meters to the power of 2 or centimeters 
times 

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,040
centimeters and that becomes 

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,660
centimeters to the power of 2. Very, very 

43
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,500
important. So for normal lengths 

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,580
, the centimetre is quite normal without a 

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,820
superscript and for areas it is then 

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,020
to the power of 2. So, then it's also 
about 

47
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,320
volume. Volumes are calculated 

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,340
from the product of three lengths and 

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,820
have length units to the power of 3. So 

50
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,240
now we no longer have one or 

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,460
even just two lengths, but we 

52
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,520
have three lengths. One is the width, 

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,980
one is the length and one is the height. 

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,820
This means that it then becomes 

55
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,460
a space , so to speak, and because 

56
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,620
we 

57
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,240

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,060
multiply centimetres by centimetres by 
centimetres, i.e. three times , it then 
becomes 3 to the power of 3, 

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,220
i.e. centimetres to the power of 3 or 

60
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,340
meters to the power of 3. We repeat 

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,140
again. A length, a completely 

62
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,100
normal length, has no superscript, 

63
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,620
so it is simply centimeters. An 

64
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,260
area that results from two lengths 

65
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,040
is to the power of 2, for 

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,580
example square meters or 

67
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,180
square centimeters. And then there is a 

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,560
volume 

69
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,420
that results from three lengths, which 

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,940
is then called cubic centimeters 

71
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,300
or cubic meters. So, 

72
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,420
let's move on. Right, 

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,700
now let's talk about cubes. 

74
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,320
The properties of a cube 

75
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,600
are that we 

76
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,820
have six boundary faces. This means that 
all the 

77
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,260
squares have the same edge lengths 

78
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,000
. Exactly. And what is also very 

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,340
important is that all the corners of the 
cube 

80
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,300
are right angles. 

81
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,280
In other words, I can briefly 

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,100
draw in the fact that we 

83
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,400
have right angles everywhere. 

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,040
That 

85
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,460
's very important, because 

86
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,290
because all the lengths 

87
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,410
are the same, you have 

88
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:21,170
90 degree angles everywhere. Exactly. Like 
this. 

89
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,290
Exactly. We already have that here 

90
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,870
. So, for example, if you 

91
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,870
want to calculate the surface area, 

92
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,290
you would do a to the power of 2 

93
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,410
plus a to the power of 2 plus a to the 
power of 2 plus a 

94
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,390
to the power of 2. Plus a to the power of 
2, 

95
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,130
so 6 times a to the power of 2 and that's 

96
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,690
6a to the power of 2 at the end. Now the 

97
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,010
surface area of a cube. There 

98
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,870
are three squares 

99
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,410
that all 

100
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:57,180
have the same surface area. That's 
obvious, because they're 

101
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,580
all the same size, they all have the 

102
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,380
same edge length and they 

103
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,560
all have the same angles, in this case 

104
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,820
right angles , so 

105
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,980
it's also clear that the 

106
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,280
surface area, i.e. the 

107
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,800
surface area of the six squares, 

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
excuse me , 

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,130
has the same value. And then, of course, 
there 

110
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,670
is the volume of the cube, because it 

111
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,830
is a solid, which means that it goes 

112
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,890
into every plane, so it has 

113
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,950
a width, a length and also a 

114
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,330
height, and this is how you calculate 

115
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,390
the volume. This is the 

116
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,750
product of all the side lengths. So, 

117
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,690
for example, A 

118
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,790
times A times A equals A to the power of 3 
and 

119
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,950
that is our volume. 

120
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,030
In other words, we calculate once, 

121
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,180
we take this a, this a and this a 

122
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,300
and multiply them together, 

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,020
i.e. 3 times a and that results in 

124
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,280
a times a times a times a, which results 
in a 

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,240
to the power of 3. Very importantly, we 
can 

126
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,200
now also see that the volume 

127
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
naturally uses the power of 3 

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
and that this then becomes, for example, 

129
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
a unit of 

130
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,400
cubic centimetres or cubic meters 

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,540
. Exactly. So, now we 

132
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,420
continue. Now we'll talk about the 

133
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,620
cuboid. The cuboid is another 

134
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,640
solid. Its 

135
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,820
properties are that the 

136
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,160
hexagons are the 

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,700
boundary surfaces, 

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,420
two of which are equal. All the 

139
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,100
corners of the cuboid are right angles, 
which 

140
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,960
is also very important. So again, we 

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
have six rectangles as 

142
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,480
boundary faces 

143
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,020
, two of which are equal and all the 

144
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,800
corners of the cuboid are right angles. 

145
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
So, then the surface area of the 

146
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,840
cuboid. It's very important to 

147
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,600
mention that we have six 

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,860
rectangles 

149
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,800
, two of which have the 

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
same surface area. So, for 

151
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,560
example, here you can see 

152
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
the example of how you 

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,860
would calculate this. So A, large A, that 

154
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,600
means that the area is 

155
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,040
equal to A times B plus A times C plus B 

156
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,300
times A plus B times C plus C times A plus 

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,780
C times B. equal to 2ab plus 2ac plus 

158
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,980
2bc . So we simply calculate the 

159
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,460
different areas, i.e. the 

160
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,840
different lengths 

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,500
together. For example, we 

162
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,820
now have 6 rectangles 

163
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,700
here, for example here. Once we have 

164
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,220
9 here, 

165
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,130
let's do it again. 

166
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,170
We have a rectangle here, for example. 

167
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,710
Here is a rectangle. 

168
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,260
Here. 

169
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,420
So we have six rectangles 

170
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,100
in total. And then we 

171
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,740
multiply all the sides 

172
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,180
by all the other sides. So, for 

173
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,000
example, here you can see A times B times 

174
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,320
C. And then here B times A. B times C. C 

175
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,820
times A. c times b. 

176
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,500
Like this. So you can see that you 

177
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,380
always 

178
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,180
start with a , for example, then 

179
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,620
multiply everything together , then start 
with b and 

180
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,140
then start with c. That's very 

181
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,560
important. And then we arrive at 

182
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,460
the result 2ab plus 

183
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,920
2ac plus 2bc. So, the volume of the 

184
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,520
cuboid. Exactly, so. The volume of the 

185
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,760
cuboid. A cuboid, as we 

186
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,840
discussed earlier, is the 

187
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,500
product of all the side lengths. So 

188
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,020
once the width, once the height 

189
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,440
and once the length. So in this 

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,500
case, we would simply 

191
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,180
calculate A times B times C and that gives 
us 

192
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,480
the volume of the cuboid. 

193
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,660
So for example, we could now 

194
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,340
equal V here, now we have 

195
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,200
different lengths, for example 

196
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,440
A is now equal to 2, B is equal to 3 

197
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,390
and C is equal to 4. So then 

198
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,710
we would first calculate 2 times 3, 

199
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,790
which is of course 6 and then another 

200
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,790
4 is then 24. So we know that 

201
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,790
our volume is 24 and then 

202
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,930
of course it would be 24 cubic. or 24 

203
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,910
cubic meters. Exactly, like that. 

204
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,070
Let's move on to the next one, which is 
the 

205
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,250
prism. The prism has the 

206
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,070
properties that the body 

207
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,490

208
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,830
has the same base and top surface , so 
it's a body with 

209
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,990
the same base and top surface. Then 

210
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,910
the 

211
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,080
shells are connected and 

212
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,840
we find the height H here. This is our 
height. So 

213
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,220
our base area is down here 

214
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,660
and our top area is here. 

215
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,060
So you can imagine that 

216
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,580
we have a base and then 

217
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,360
just another cover 

218
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,020
on top. And the outer surface, which 

219
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,700
encases the whole thing, is 

220
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,380
this here and this here and also 

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,780
what we see here at the front. So this 

222
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,160
at the front. Exactly, so it has 

223
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,600
three surfaces here and the whole thing is 

224
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,640
always the lateral surface. So 

225
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,700
if you look at it all together, what 

226
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,740
it encases. That's why it's 

227
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,600
also called the lateral surface. And 

228
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,380
the two surfaces, 

229
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,000
the base surface and the 

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,260
top surface, are connected by the height 
of the lateral surface. So 

231
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,480
the surface area of the prism 

232
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,200
is made up of 

233
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,600

234
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,140
the base, top and lateral surfaces, i.e. 

235
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,520
all three different surfaces. 

236
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,460
And it depends on whether it is the 

237
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,960
base or the top surface. 

238
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,980
Different 

239
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,760
formulas are then used to 

240
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,920
calculate this. So, for example, here we 

241
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,780
have the formula for 

242
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,340
our surface area. 

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,140
So A of O is equal to A of the 

244
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,220
base surface plus A of the top surface 

245
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,680
plus A of the lateral surface. So 2AG 

246
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,980
plus AM. Now, don't be surprised 

247
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,160
why the top surface has suddenly 

248
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,360
disappeared and there is now simply a 2 

249
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,660
in front of it. We know that 

250
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,240
the top surface and the base surface 

251
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,900
have the same area because they 

252
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,720

253
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
have one floor and one ceiling. And the 
ceiling can 

254
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,580
't be smaller than the floor and 

255
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,540
the floor can't be smaller than the 

256
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:02,860
ceiling. 

257
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,300
That's why we simply 

258
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,540
said, okay, then we'll write 

259
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,420
AG there now, because it's the 

260
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,760
same anyway and that's times 2. 

261
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,200
So once for the base area and 

262
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,120
once for the top area. Exactly. 

263
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,620
The volume of the prism is then 

264
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,520
also the product of the base area and 

265
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,920
the height of the prism. So here, we 

266
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,380
now have our 

267
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,460
base area and then our height 

268
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,680
h. So why do we just say 

269
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,800
the base area and the height of the 

270
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,200
prism? Because with a 

271
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,020
volume , we always need 

272
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,740
a surface area and then a 

273
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,660
height, which makes it 

274
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,480
three-dimensional, i.e. to the power of 3. 

275
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,140
So, in this case, our 

276
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,100
formula is volume equals A of G, i.e. A 

277
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,840
of the base area, times H, times the 

278
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,480
height of the shell vane. OK, 

279
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,160
let's move on. So, now the cylinder. 

280
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,640
The cylinder has the 

281
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,000
properties of a prism, so 

282
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,680
it's a prism with a circle as the base 

283
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,440
 and top surface. So you can see 

284
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,900
here, again we have 

285
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
our base and top surface here and here and 

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,480
this is then our height again and 

287
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,680
the dimension is then of course 

288
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,520
the lateral surface again, so 

289
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:29,780
this is here. 

290
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,250
So, the surface area of the 

291
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,570
cylinder is calculated by 

292
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,910
using this formula here, but 

293
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,970
of course you have to 

294
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,650
mention first that the surface area is 

295
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,630
the total area of the whole cylinder 

296
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,690
and that is made up of 

297
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,370
the base area, the 

298
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,890
top area and the lateral area. So, 

299
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,510
the base and the top surface are 

300
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,470
of course the same again, just like 

301
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,730
with the prism, in this case there are 

302
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,530
two circles and they 

303
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,630
also have the same radius R. This 

304
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,210
gives us the formula AG 

305
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,310
equals Pi times R to the power of 2. That 
is then 

306
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,270
our, our, exactly. This gives us 

307
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,070
our, our, 

308
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,770
the area of our 

309
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,730
base. Then we 

310
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,110
already have this. I' 

311
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,620
m just adding that back in. Exactly. And 
then 

312
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,240
, of course, we also want to 

313
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,300
calculate our lateral area. This 

314
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,180
is a rectangle with the sides 2 times 

315
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,520
P times R and H. So 

316
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,120
you calculate the lateral surface area 
like this, 2 times P times R 

317
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
times H, because if you unfold it 

318
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,320
, the whole cylinder so to speak, 

319
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,080
you can see that the lateral surface area 
is rectangular 

320
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,260
. So, to calculate the whole thing, 

321
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,820
i.e. the entire 

322
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,360
surface area, we 

323
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
first have to 

324
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,220

325
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,700
multiply our base area, which we have 
already calculated above, by 2, because we 

326
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,680
not only have a base area, but 

327
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,980
also a top area, only the two 

328
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,220
are 

329
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,380
identical in size. That's why 

330
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,020
we multiply that by 2 and then add the 

331
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,260
surface area here. We've 

332
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,660
already calculated that here too. So, 
that's 

333
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,400
2 times Pi times R to the power of 2. 2 
plus 2 

334
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,260
times Pi times R times H. Exactly, and 
then 

335
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,200
we already have the 

336
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,340
surface area of a cylinder. 

337
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,540
So, the volume of a cylinder 

338
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,260
is calculated by using the formula V 

339
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,240
equals A times G times H. 

340
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,960
We already had this formula 

341
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,120
for our prism. This is the 

342
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,060
general formula for prisms 

343
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,640
and then 

344
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,880
of course we have a circle, which is our 

345
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
base area, so our 

346
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,040
calculation is V equals A times G times H 

347
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,720
equals Pi times R to the power of 2 times 
H. This is 

348
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,540
our formula for the volume 

349
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,140
of the cylinder. 

350
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,840
So, now we have another 

351
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,520
example problem here. Exactly. A sylo, 
which 

352
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,200
has the shape of a cylinder, is to 

353
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,020
be completely filled with grain. 

354
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,420
How much grain can the sylo hold? 

355
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,800
Well, a sylo is just a 

356
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,680
container. Exactly. The 

357
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,620
outside of the sylo is to be painted. How 
many 

358
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,440
square meters will be 

359
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,820
covered with paint ? Like this. 

360
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,020
In any case, we know that our diameter is 
5 

361
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,840
meters. And our height is 7 

362
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,140
meters. That's the information we 

363
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,600
have. So, the capacity 

364
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,300
corresponds to the volume, because the 

365
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,940
volume is 3-dimensional, i.e. 

366
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,840
how much fits into what and 

367
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,980
that is also the 

368
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,320
capacity. So, our formula 

369
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,820
for our volume, of course, as 

370
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,680
we discussed earlier, is 

371
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,680
V equals A times G times H equals Pi times 

372
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,600
R to the power of 2 times H. 

373
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,480
But now we have to be careful, because the 
diameter 

374
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,820
is given. The diameter is 

375
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,820
that if you 

376
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,400
walk from one end of the circle to the 
other end. And 

377
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,480
this distance that you walk is then 

378
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,580
our diameter. 

379
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,540
But our radius is basically half of 

380
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,340
the diameter. So if you walk from 

381
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,960
the center to one end, 

382
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,140
that is, to the edge. So 

383
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,960
we have to divide the diameter by 2 

384
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,020
to get the radius 

385
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,460
. In this case, our 

386
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,620
diameter is 5 meters, 

387
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,700
so we divide that by 2 to get 2.5 

388
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,400
meters. So our answer is 

389
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,300
, because now we 

390
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,140
already have the height, which was 7 
meters, then 

391
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,760
we have the diameter and then 

392
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,680
we 

393
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,580
always have pi , of course , we type it 
all into 

394
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,960
the pocket calculator or calculate it 

395
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,560
by hand and then we come to 

396
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,440
the result that the Sylo 

397
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,700
can hold about 137 .44 cubic meters of 
grain. 

398
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
That's how much grain it can hold. 

399
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,640
Because we can also see here now 

400
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,340
that this was used at the time, for 

401
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,580
example, for the radius of 2.5 meters, 

402
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,360
because we have already 

403
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,580
calculated this earlier , and for the 
height of 7 

404
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,820
meters, that was already 

405
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,340
given before , times Pi. And then we come 
to 

406
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,040
the conclusion that that's it, the 

407
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,420
volume. 137.44 cubic meters. 

408
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,900
Exactly. So, now we want to 

409
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,840

410
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,300
find out how to paint the surface. The 
floor is not 

411
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,500
painted, so we can 

412
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,120
leave out the floor. 

413
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,480
We don't have to include it in the 

414
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,720
calculation. This means 

415
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,780
that the surface area of the 

416
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,780
whole thing is then pi times R to the 
power of 2 plus 

417
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,880
2 times P times R times H, because we 

418
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,540
are now calculating 

419
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,540
our cover here once and the 

420
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,140
lateral surface once. Normally there would 
be 

421
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,500
one, no, two in the front, but 

422
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,020
because we don't 

423
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,420

424
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,220
need a lid, no base, i.e. no bottom , 
because it is not painted 

425
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,400
, we just leave out the 2, 

426
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
because we only have one lid 

427
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,300
and no 2, one bottom, one 

428
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,240
lid. Then, of course, we 

429
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,560
enter the values again, just like 

430
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,320
before, using 

431
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,620
the ones we have found out, 

432
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,520
for example the radius here 

433
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,420
and here too, and then we also 

434
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,140
enter the 7 meters, which we had 

435
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,560
already given, i.e. pi times 2.5 

436
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,940
to the power of 2 plus 2 times pi times 
2.5 times 7 

437
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,520
equals 129.6 square meters. It is very 

438
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,020
important to note that we are now dealing 

439
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,520
with an area, 

440
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,640
i.e. a surface area. And that's why 

441
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,780
we have to use square meters 

442
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,640
instead of cubic meters, as in the 

443
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,140
previous example, because we're no longer 
dealing 

444
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,280
with a volume here, 

445
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,740
but with an area. And that is 

446
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,940
squared, i.e. to the power of 2, not 

447
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,280
to the power of 3. So our answer is 

448
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,040
that approximately 129.6 

449
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,020
square meters 

450
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,540
need to be covered with paint. 

451
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,540
Now we have another 

452
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,180
example task. We have to 

453
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,760
calculate the surface area of a 

454
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,560
prism with a legal triangle 

455
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,000
as its base. We have 

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,300
given the values. Firstly, the first 

457
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,060
cathetus of the triangle, which is A 

458
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,480
equals 3 cm, the second cathetus 

459
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,040
was also given, which is 4 

460
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,980
cm, B equals 4 and the hypotenosis of the 

461
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,340
triangle C equals 5 cm. And, of course, 

462
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,440
the height of the 

463
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,720
prism at the end , which is 6.5 cm. So, 

464
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,640
now we've entered everything here 

465
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,720
and we can see that we 

466
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,280
also 

467
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,540
have a right angle here . Okay, now 

468
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,740
let's move on. So, to 

469
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,820

470
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,320
calculate the surface area of a prism , we 
need this formula 

471
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,300
here. a of o equals 2 times ag plus 

472
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,720
am. ag is even, so g stands for the 

473
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,960
base area and for the top area, 

474
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,420
so it is calculated times 2, 

475
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,760
plus the lateral area, i.e. the 

476
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,520
areas of the lateral surfaces. Exactly, so 

477
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,560
we now see the prism 

478
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,440
unfolded here and then see that it 

479
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,960

480
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,740
has different shapes. This allows us to 

481
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,340
see that the surface consists of three 

482
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,680
rectangles, i.e. the 

483
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,000
lateral surface and the two identical, 

484
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,140
two equal rectangles in the 

485
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,280
triangles, which are the 

486
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,560
base and the top surface. 

487
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,320
So what we 

488
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,200
have to do here is 

489
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
calculate the base or the top surface, 
which is 

490
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,180
the right-angled triangle. Here we 

491
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,340
can also see the right angle. 

492
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,220
So a of g equals a times b by 2 

493
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,940
, then we put 

494
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,740
in all the values we were given, 3 

495
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,860
times 4 cm by 2 and that's 6 

496
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,420
square centimeters. So we know 

497
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,120
that the area of our base and 

498
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,340
top surface 

499
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,120
is exactly 6 cm² . And then we also see 

500
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,800
the lateral surface. There are the 

501
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,320
three sides with A, B and C and the 

502
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,820
height H. So we calculate the A of 

503
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,660
M as A times H plus B times H plus C 

504
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,740
times H. So we put all the 

505
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,300
values back in. This is then 3 cm 

506
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:35,480
times 6.5 cm times 4 cm times 6.5 cm plus 

507
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,620
4 cm times 6.5 cm plus 5 cm times 6.5 cm. 

508
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,000
And then we arrive at the value 78 

509
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,380
cm². So our surface area is 

510
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,440
78 cm². So, the total surface area of the 

511
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,420
base surface and the lateral surface 

512
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,740
is 90 cm². Here we calculate 

513
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,340
2 times a of g plus a of m, 

514
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,040
i.e. 2 times 6 cm² plus 68 cm². 78 

515
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,220
square centimeters are then 90 

516
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,040
square centimeters. So our 

517
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,660
answer is that the prism we 

518
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,800
have just seen has a 

519
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,500
total surface area of 90 

520
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,760
square centimeters. So, that's all there 
is to it 

521
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,140
. I hope you've 

522
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,640

523
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,880
