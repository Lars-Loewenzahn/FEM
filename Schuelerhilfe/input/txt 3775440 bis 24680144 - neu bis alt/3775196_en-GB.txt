00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,590
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,630
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,550
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,410

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,390

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,930

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,090
explain something about electron 
configuration and the order of the 
elements in the periodic table. In our 
online 

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,850
 learning center you will 

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,230
of course find a wiki  on this topic 

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,450
, in which the 

11
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,110
basic and important terms 

12
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,530
are explained in detail. Today 

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,090
we are going to look at the periodic table 
of 

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,850
the elements, or PSE for short, its 

15
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,890
classification system and the principles 

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,670
behind it. The 

17
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,770
periodic table as a classification system 
of the 

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,170
elements was 

19
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,450

20
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,430
founded in the 1860s by the chemists 
Mendeleev and Meyer independently of each 
other. 

21
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,950
Both recognized the natural 

22
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,650
classification system and 

23
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,390

24
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,790
presented it in the form of the table we 
know today. If you look at the PSE 

25
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,550
, you can see that the elements 

26
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,250

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,610

28
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,650
are also arranged in groups and periods , 
except according to increasing atomic 
number, which corresponds to the number of 
protons . 

29
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,430
The atomic numbers range from 1 to 

30
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,470
118, which shows the existence of 118 

31
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,110
elements. When the PSE 

32
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,330
was founded, a good half 

33
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,310
of these 118 elements had not yet 

34
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,090
been discovered, but the 

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,930
assumption was that the undiscovered 

36
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,090
elements must also exist and that there 

37
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,590

38
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,070
would be no gaps in the table. Meyer was 
thus able to 

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,510

40
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,790

41
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,230

42
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,850

43
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,850
predict the properties of the previously 
unknown elements gallium, then called 
Eka-aluminum, scandium , then called 
Eka-Bohr, and germanium, then called 
Eka-silicon. The 

44
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,770
columns in the periodic table are the 

45
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,470
groups and the rows are called 

46
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,410
periods. The periodic table has eight 

47
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,010
main groups, between which are the 

48
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,210
subgroups. This 

49
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,370
arrangement in groups and periods has to 

50
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,010
do with the electron configuration 

51
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,570
of the elements, which 

52
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,410

53
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,150
has an effect on the reactivity of the 
elements. The 

54
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,710
electron configuration can 

55
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,370

56
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,750
be represented using the shell model of 
the atomic shell. This model 

57
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,490
shows the distribution of electrons 

58
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,690
on the shells. The shells 

59
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,390

60
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,610
are named with letters beginning with K. 
How many shells the atom of 

61
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,470
an element has can be recognized by 

62
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,070
the period in which the element is 

63
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,870
located . Elements of the first period 

64
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,690
have only the first shell, K. 

65
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,310
Elements of the seventh period have 

66
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,690
shells K to Q, i.e. 7. The 

67
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,710
first shell K holds a maximum of two 

68
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,730
electrons, the second shell L 

69
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,350
a maximum of eight, the third shell M 

70
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,830
also eight for the time being. Chlorine, 
which is in 

71
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,530
the third period, has 

72
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,170
three shells on which its 

73
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,910
17 electrons are distributed. The 

74
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,490
main group number corresponds to the 

75
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,550
number of valence electrons, i.e. the 

76
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,190
electrons that are located in the 
outermost 

77
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,910
shell and 

78
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,510
are involved in bonding . Elements of the 
first 

79
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,670
main group have one valence electron, 

80
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,030
elements of the second main group 

81
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,310
have two and so on. 

82
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,730
The maximum number of valence electrons 

83
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,370
is therefore 8. Elements with the same 

84
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,230
number of valence electrons have 

85
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,070
similar properties, especially 

86
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,730
in terms of bonding and 

87
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,710
reactivity. Elements of the eighth 

88
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,810
main group, the noble gases, are 

89
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,590
particularly stable and have a 

90
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,150

91
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,330
fully filled 

92
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,870
outer shell with eight valence electrons 
or helium with two outer electrons . The 
other elements 

93
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,530
also strive 

94
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,790
for this configuration. The elements of 
the seventh 

95
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,350
main group, the halogens, which are only 

96
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,250
missing one outer electron, are 

97
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,550
correspondingly reactive and have high 

98
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,730
electronegativities. 

99
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,910
Electronegativity, or En for short, is 

100
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,750
the relative measure of 

101
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,370
an atom's ability to attract electrons 

102
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,170
. The higher the 

103
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,390
electronegativity, the stronger 

104
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,870
the respective atom attracts the 

105
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,850
electrons of the bond. The 

106
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,690
electronegativity of an element 

107
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,890
can be read off in the PSE. Within 

108
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,930
the main groups, the 

109
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,850
electronegativity increases from left to 

110
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,190
right, i.e. from the first to the 

111
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,350
seventh main group. 

112
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,310
As the period increases, i.e. from top 

113
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,410
to bottom, the 

114
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,350
electronegativity decreases. Fluorine 

115
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,330
has the highest electronegativity at 4. 

116
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,970
The further to the left the main group is, 

117
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,070
the lower the 

118
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,350
electronegativity. 

119
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,090

120
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,230
With their low 

121
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,450
electronegativity , elements from the 
first to the third main group tend to 

122
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,450
give up electrons in order 

123
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,570

124
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,150

125
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,250
to achieve the electron configuration of 
the noble gas of the period below. Sodium, 
for example, would 

126
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,090

127
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,470

128
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,130

129
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,550
achieve the noble gas configuration of the 
preceding element neon by releasing its 
valence electron. Magnesium also tends 

130
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,190
to give off two 

131
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,630
outer electrons during reaction in order 

132
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,450

133
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,870
to have the electron configuration of neon 
. Thank you for your 

134
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,430
attention. I hope this 

135
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,170
video has helped you to better 

136
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,190
understand the topic. See you 

137
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,990
next time.
