00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,670
Hello and welcome. My 

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,650
name is Elena and I'm going to 

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,230
do the webinar with you today. Yes, 

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,390
today it's about English, the 

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,630
Abitur series, Components of Fictional 

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,810
Text, building blocks of fictional texts. 

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,170
That's right, the 

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,170
very first thing I'm going to do is talk 
to you about the 

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,710

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,130
topic in general , i.e. present the slides 
to you. In between 

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,330
there will be a few small tasks 

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,350
and at the end I'll 

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,230
be happy to answer any questions. 

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,290
Of course, you can also 

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,230
ask questions in between or at the end, 
where 

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,490
I can 

17
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,090

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,950
ask you questions again. I can also 

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,170

20
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,930
go back a few slides when I'm at the end, 
if you like. 

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,770
So if anything is unclear 

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,590
, let me know. I'll be happy to go back 

23
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,070
and explain it again in 

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,250
a different way if you 

25
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,270
haven't understood something yet. 

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,710
Just let me know. Good. I hope 

27
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,970
you can all understand me well. 

28
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,810
And exactly. So, if there's anything, 

29
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,610
feel free to write in the chatbox. Yes, 

30
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,170
then I'll be made aware of it and 

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,630
, as I said, I can 

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,130
explain it again in a different way. So. 
I'll do the webinar, 

33
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,530
so it's, the texts, they'll 

34
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,490
be in English. If you want, 

35
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,670
I can 

36
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,330
hold the webinar in English. But I can 
also hold it in 

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,830
German, if you like. 

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,250
Let me know which language 

39
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,810
you would like to hear it in . In 

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,570
English, okay, fine. Okay, so let's 

41
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,470
start. If you don't understand my 

42
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,230
English very well, if I should 

43
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,130
explain something in a different way 

44
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,930
or in German, please tell me. I would 

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,610
love to explain something in German 

46
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,010
to you if you don't understand my 

47
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,870
English. Okay, Component. 

48
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,350
So, I'm going to read that out first 

49
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,510
and then I'm going to explain it in 

50
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,910
my own words. In order to analyze a 

51
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,570
fictional text, you need knowledge of 

52
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,170
the fundamental components that a 

53
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,190
fictional text contains. These 

54
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,850
elements are used by the author to 

55
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,950
create his own fictional word where 

56
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,090
the story takes place. They are not 

57
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,110
always obvious, therefore they need 

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,810
to be analyzed in detail. Important 

59
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,930
elements are Setting and Atmosphere, 

60
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,830
Characters and the Plot. Okay, here I 

61
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,770
just, there's nothing I can like add. 

62
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,650
So the most important things of 

63
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,990
fictional text are like the setting, 

64
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,090
so where does take place the 

65
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,570
atmosphere, like how are the persons 

66
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,290
feeling or is it like dark or how's 

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,570
the atmosphere, like in general, the 

68
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,850
characters and the plot, like what's 

69
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,610
happening. Yeah. 

70
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,270
So, Setting and Atmosphere, let's 

71
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,050
explore that. Setting. The setting 

72
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,970
used in a fictional text describes 

73
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,210
time as well as the geographic 

74
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,730
location. It answers the question of 

75
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,350
where and when. The setting can 

76
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,810
influence the character's behavior. 

77
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,190
It helps to initiate the mood for a 

78
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,750
story. So, like, the setting is 

79
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,390
important. Like, it's not only where 

80
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,250
it does take place, but when. So, 

81
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,050
also the time. It's also important, 

82
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,470
like, this also contains... Setting. 

83
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,070
Setting can influence the character's 

84
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,630
behavior, so it's a very important 

85
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,190
fact. And it also is important, the 

86
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,430
setting can also affect the mood, the 

87
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,650
mood of a story, the mood of certain 

88
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,310
persons in a story. So it's also 

89
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,650
important. Important questions 

90
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,670
referring to the setting are which 

91
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,470
year or period does the narration 

92
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,970
take place in? Which season is it? 

93
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,490
Like, I don't know, autumn, spring, 

94
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,190
whatever. What time of the day is it? 

95
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,150
Is it like noon? Is it like... 

96
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,000
Because the weather is also important 

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,900
as if it's raining or if the sun is 

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,800
coming out, whatever. It also affects 

99
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,120
the setting as maybe there may be 

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,240
sunshine or rain and it may be dark. 

101
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,600
So the setting can change. if the 

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,680
weather changes. How can the social 

103
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,260
environment be described? Like the 

104
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,240
social relation between the 

105
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,620
characters, for example. Whatever. 

106
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,160
Atmosphere. The atmosphere of a story 

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,380
describes the mood, emotions and 

108
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,480
feelings. It is a literary technique 

109
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,260
that can provide the reader with a 

110
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,300
type of feelings that he gets while 

111
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,500
reading the narrative. The atmosphere 

112
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,280
can change throughout the story, 

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,000
especially when there is a change of 

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,760
setting. As the setting contributes, 

115
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,080
So, first, the atmosphere of a story 

116
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,140
contains three main things. The mood 

117
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,740
of certain persons, it's unique. The 

118
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,760
emotions and feelings. So, then 

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,960
there's also the fact that the 

120
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,640
atmosphere can change. So, it's not 

121
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,920
static. So, when the story begins and 

122
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,740
when the story ends, the mood, the 

123
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,040
atmosphere doesn't have to be the 

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,620
same, so it can be different. The 

125
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,400
main purpose of creating a particular 

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,440
atmosphere in a story is to establish 

127
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,240
an emotional effect. Very important. 

128
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,780
Therefore, the reader tends to stay 

129
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,820
interested in the story as it appears 

130
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,660
to be more lively and exciting. So, 

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,600
yeah, the atmosphere is used to 

132
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,380
create a certain tension, suspense, 

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,280
in the story. So it's very important 

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,060
that the atmosphere is well 

135
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,980
described, so the story gets more 

136
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,200
lively and exciting for the reader to 

137
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,060
read. The place where a story takes 

138
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
place can indicate the spiritual 

139
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,000
condition of a character, where 

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,880
elements like nature, weather, colors 

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,660
and shapes have an influence on the 

142
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,520
mood. Yes, so the setting, as I 

143
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,920
described earlier, has an 

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,400
effect on the conditions of a 

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
character, how is the character, 

146
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,880
how is he known, or is the 

147
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,840
character in a good mood or 

148
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,080
something like that . But the elements 
like nature, 

149
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,680
weather, colors and shapes, they 

150
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,100
affect the mood, how do the 

151
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
people feel for example, how is the 

152
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,320
story conveyed. example so 

153
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,680
this especially into helped a fluid 

154
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
mode world almost 

155
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,500
so fitting out of context setting and 

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,260
atmosphere can be so here on the 

157
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,320
possible task you may see in your 

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,760
exam oh yeah in it they could be in 

159
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,800
every exam yeah in every oral exam 

160
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,460
whatever is called the atmosphere in the 

161
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,100
text circle 

162
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:31,920
How was the 

163
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,760
author created? Explain your 

164
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,040
opinion with evidence from the text. So 

165
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,500
all the points that we as I 

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,780
described before are important 

167
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,320
for this to 

168
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,880
answer these questions. So, the atmosphere 
and the 

169
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,260
atmosphere are not, they're 

170
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,000
not, they don't just contain a 

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
fact. They are very, like big 

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,400
facts, so they contain, for 

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,160
example, color, like the weather, 

174
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
whatever, I already explained it 

175
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,500
earlier, but they are very 

176
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,040
important for a story. So if you get 

177
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,540
asked, for example, how is the 

178
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,260
atmosphere in the text created by the 

179
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,840
author? You can say, for example, 

180
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,040
yeah, the weather is good, the 

181
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
weather is bad, whatever. You can 

182
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,380
describe it if the sun shines, if 

183
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,540
it's raining, if there's a 

184
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,320
thunderstorm. What time of the day is 

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,360
it? For example, you can describe all 

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
these facts to describe better in 

187
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,360
detail, to get more points, for 

188
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,260
example. If you describe it in detail 

189
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,740
, it's better for your 

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,960
Grätsch. Phrases. Possible phrases 

191
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,100
you can use. Setting. The 

192
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,580
story takes place in. The 

193
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,000
story takes place in time, 

194
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,140
for example in the time of the 

195
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,980
Second World War. For example. 

196
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,720
The way in which the action is. 

197
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,060
A bit of... ...whatever. 

198
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,640
The action creates itself from... 

199
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,980
...to... So all these phrases are so 

200
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
-called useful phrases you can use in 

201
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,120
your exam to start the description of 

202
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,700
the setting. Atmosphere. Useful 

203
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,640
phrases for the atmosphere. The fact 

204
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,340
that creates a warm or friendly, 

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,100
cold, happy, sinister, frozen, 

206
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,220
hostile atmosphere. There is a change 

207
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,920
of atmosphere when, for example, when 

208
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,440
the king enters. The atmosphere is 

209
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,420
charged with anger. The friendly, 

210
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,900
warm, cold, whatever, atmosphere has 

211
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,280
an impact on. So these are useful 

212
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,480
phrases to describe the atmosphere. 

213
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Exercise, so first exercise. Please 

214
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,480
read the text. I will read it out 

215
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
loud. Scene 1, so it's from Sam 

216
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
Shepard, True West. Scene 1, night, 

217
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,820
sound of crickets and dark. 

218
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,940
Candlelight appears in alcove. 

219
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,220
So, the question 

220
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,260
for you is, how does the setting 

221
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,760
contribute to the mood of scene one? 

222
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,140
So, please write in the chat box, 

223
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,980
like, what is your opinion? Please 

224
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,080
answer or try. to answer the question 

225
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,920
. Just name one 

226
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,740
or two aspects. I don't need 

227
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,960
the full round. Just one or two 

228
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,320
thoughts that are enough. 

229
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,560
Maybe you have some of these 

230
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,680
ideas. I'm waiting for answers. For 

231
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,180
example, 

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,360
look at how the description 

233
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,520
is written. Is it peaceful? 

234
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,300
Is it vulnerable? Is it? I 

235
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,610
don't know. Read it and maybe 

236
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,110
you' ll have an idea. 

237
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,670
So, I got an answer. 

238
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,650
Moonlight means peaceful. That's 

239
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,270
right. So, I think I would 

240
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,530

241
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,170
end the excerpt that it's very peaceful 

242
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,810
and the atmosphere is such a nice and 

243
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,750
peaceful It's a very quiet 

244
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,970
setting, like a towel, a 

245
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,130
cigarette stream. It's like 

246
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,510
they're not in any jolt. They have 

247
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,370
time, they are cold. A cable chair 

248
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,470
breaking on the table. It's 

249
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,290
also a bit romantic. 

250
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,750
So it's a very calm atmosphere that makes 
you 

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,670
feel good. 

252
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,990
If you 

253
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,650
can 't read the description , You get 
maybe a different sense 

254
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,970
of what they are saying here in the 

255
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,630
dialogue. So the description is very 

256
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,270
good for analyzing or for getting a 

257
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,730
look how the atmosphere is. If here 

258
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,090
would be a different, for example, a 

259
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,510
different description, we would get a 

260
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,990
different sense of how this dialogue 

261
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,510
may be. So if there 

262
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,870

263
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,010
were , for example, I don't know, peace 
and very loud noises, then it wouldn 

264
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,230
't be so peaceful. So we would 

265
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,470
get a sense of, oh, this is 

266
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,590
not peaceful, what's going on? But 

267
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,150
now with this description 

268
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,650
we can see that it's a peaceful 

269
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,950
situation. Yeah, so a next 

270
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,190
training device, another 

271
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,490
training device. It's also how the 

272
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,490
change of setting 

273
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,070
affects the mouth and atmosphere. 

274
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,790
Just look at the text. I'm going to 

275
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,710
read it all out like I did before 

276
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,630
. And just one or two answers 

277
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,430
are enough. So, scene 9, with, 

278
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,570
okay, it's by George Bernard Shaw. 

279
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,650
Popp, Marlion. Scene 9. with 

280
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,890
Dinosaur, blazing, the Stage is 

281
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,330
watched. Bottle's Toast is smashed, 

282
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,390
typewriter, ripped out, telephone, 

283
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,110
etc. All the debris from previous 

284
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,250
scene is now starkly visible in 

285
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,210
intense yellow light. The effect 

286
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,690
should be like a desert junkyard at 

287
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,450
high noon. The coolness of the 

288
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,130
preceding scene is totally 

289
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,950
obliterated. Austin is seated, a 

290
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,650
table in a coffin, shirt open, 

291
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,630
pouring with sweat. Hunched over a 

292
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,990
writing note. ... 

293
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,990
... 

294
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,250
So, how does the change of setting 

295
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,410
affect the mood and atmosphere? So, 

296
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,670
we read the first excerpt and now we 

297
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,150
have the second excerpt. Like, how is 

298
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,210
the change transmitted? Can you tell 

299
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,210
me how is the change of setting 

300
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,210
affect the mood and atmosphere? Tell 

301
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,810
me. So, write in the chat box maybe. 

302
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,370
So. 

303
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,690
That's right. So in the first excerpt 

304
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,870
they're very relaxed and calm and 

305
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,830
everything was peaceful. But now the 

306
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,030
change of the setting, like they are 

307
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,730
not running, but they are going 

308
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,990
somewhere. And everything is very 

309
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,150
stressful and it's very uncomfortable 

310
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,890
because they're sweating. And here 

311
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,110
it's a blazing heat, so it's very, 

312
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,450
very hot. And smashed typewriter, a 

313
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,010
ripped out telephone, so something is 

314
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,410
broken as well. So there's a very 

315
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,090
abrupt... Change of settings, change 

316
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,610
of mood and atmosphere as well. So 

317
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,990
yeah, it's very uncomfortable, the 

318
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,770
mood and the atmosphere. Like you 

319
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,330
don't feel very good in the setting. 

320
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,440
Characters. The characters are a 

321
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,820
significant element of every literary 

322
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,660
text. With their decisions, dialog 

323
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,920
and action, they determine the course 

324
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
of action. A character has the 

325
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,020
following characteristics. Behavior, 

326
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,040
emotions and things. These three 

327
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,620
components are very 

328
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,980
common for characters. So it's important 
when you're 

329
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,760
doing an analysis to 

330
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,000

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,640
deal with these three characteristics . So 
behavior, 

332
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,520
emotions and thinking. So, explicit 

333
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,300
characterization, so in more 

334
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,020
detail. The narrator or another 

335
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,720
character describes the character 

336
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,860
directly. Therefore following 

337
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,360
characteristics are described to the 

338
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,080
reader. Outward experience, 

339
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,160
appearance, habits, behavior, 

340
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,820
attitudes and opinions. So that's an 

341
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,100
explicit characterization. So it's in 

342
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,520
more detail. The reader gets like 

343
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,800
more of what the character looks 

344
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,840
like, how the character looks like. 

345
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,800
So it gets more details about the 

346
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,600
character. Then there is also, so we 

347
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,880
have the explicit characterization 

348
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,020
and we have the implicit 

349
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,500
characterization. The character is 

350
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
introduced indirectly. The reader has 

351
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,960
to analyze given information in order 

352
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
to define the characteristics of the 

353
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,180
character. Information that might be 

354
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,400
relevant are thought process, 

355
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,600
behavior, speech, way of talking, 

356
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,900
appearance, communication with other 

357
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,360
characters. 

358
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,540
It is simply that the character 

359
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,040
is introduced indirectly. 

360
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,940
It's not written in the book. Yes, 

361
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,860
Mr. Johnson has dark hair, has 

362
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,960
blue eyes, is very friendly. 

363
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,220
But if you 

364
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,740
can read the story, you get an 
understanding 

365
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,120
of how the character behaves 

366
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,040
or how he looks. But just 

367
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
uncomfortable. So it's not 

368
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,800
written, ah, Mr. Johnson is so 

369
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,240
and so, but it's implicit. You 

370
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
get an implicit sense of what 

371
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,460
the character looks like or how the 

372
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,920
character feels, whatever. 

373
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,080
Constellation of characters. The 

374
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
constellation of characters 

375
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,540
describes the relationship between 

376
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,200
characters from a literary text. 

377
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,540
We can categorize characters into 

378
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,060
groups if some people always stick up 

379
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,700
for each other or if we can identify 

380
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,120
a leader, a role model. 

381
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,410
Every time you describe a character, 

382
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,250
they are in a group. So if they stick 

383
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,490
in this group. Or we can identify a 

384
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,990
leader. So the person who is leading 

385
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,610
everything, a role model. Also 

386
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,570
possible. Therefore it is important 

387
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,690
to consider the relationship 

388
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,770
between the individual 

389
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,350
characters . 

390
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,670
The relationship between the 

391
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,890
characters is important to 

392
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,130

393
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,630
get the desperation of characters , how 
are the characters with 

394
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,010
each other? Are they good friends or 

395
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,210
are they more than friends? Or are they 

396
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,850
enemies? So the relationship is 

397
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,990
very important for these factors. To 

398
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,170
reflect on the attitude, If 

399
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,790
the characters have towards another 

400
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,430
character, we can use the following 

401
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,430
terms. Affection, dislike, 

402
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,410
friendship, rivalry, peaceful 

403
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,950
relationship, tense relationship, 

404
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,590
distant relationship. Distant 

405
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,650
relationship. That's not right here. 

406
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,770
It's like this relationship, a very 

407
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:01,110
close relationship. Needs to sound 

408
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,830
here. Loyalty and hostility. So these 

409
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,530
are like... 

410
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,250
different words, how you can describe 

411
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,470
a relationship, for example. 

412
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,680
Development of a character. So, 

413
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,380
there's a gradual development. The 

414
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,200
development of a character depends on 

415
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,520
many factors. It happens in more than 

416
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,840
one phase. Then there's the abrupt 

417
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,980
change. The character has a sudden 

418
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,400
change of heart, often used in short 

419
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,860
stories. 

420
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,660
In the stories, the characters 

421
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,980
change. So it can either 

422
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,560
be a gradual development, 

423
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,300
where you can see it, or an 

424
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,140
abrupt change. It is often 

425
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,740
mentioned in short stories. To 

426
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,240

427
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,360
analyze the development of a character , 
we need to 

428
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,140
identify the reasons for the change, 

429
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,040
such as what happened 

430
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,880
or why it happened or so 

431
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,880
on, and find important quotes and 

432
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,180
extracts 

433
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,140
that signal the change. So we need to 

434
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,640

435
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,520
get a quote or 

436
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,080
get the extract from the text that already 

437
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,700

438
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,260
gives a clue about the change. So they 

439
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,520
put like an important, for example, 

440
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,620
question mark or exclamation mark or 

441
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,800
whatever. So the story gives us 

442
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,640
already a hint of why the person 

443
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,440
changes and we need to find it in the 

444
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,760
text. 

445
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,130
Tasks. So possible tasks concerning 

446
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,070
characters can be. Who are the main 

447
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,530
characters? How are they presented? 

448
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,250
What is the characters function in 

449
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,590
the text? Describe the character. Pay 

450
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,370
attention to the ... 

451
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,770
All these possible tasks can be in 

452
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,050
your exam. So, yeah, who are the main 

453
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,530
characters? How are they presented? 

454
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,430
For example, we just had Lee and 

455
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,590
Orson. And now you have to present 

456
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,010
them. You have to describe them in 

457
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,830
detail. Yeah, and analyze their 

458
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:52,930
behavior, whatever. Another exercise. 

459
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,150
Ernst Hemingway, the old man and the 

460
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,450
sea. So, the task at the end will 

461
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,150
be... He characterized the old man by 

462
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,910
using the information that I've given 

463
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,050
in the text. Define the relationship 

464
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,850
between the two characters and 

465
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,870
explain your reasons. He was an old 

466
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,050
man who fished alone in a skiff 

467
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,990
in the Gulf Stream and he had gone 84 

468
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,450
days now without taking a fish. In 

469
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,310
the first 40 days the boy had been 

470
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,110
with him. But after 40 days without a 

471
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,490
fish the boy's parents had told him 

472
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,470
that the old man was now definitely 

473
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,650
and finally salaud, which is the 

474
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,590
worst form of unlove. and the boy 

475
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,910
was in another boat in which he 

476
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,290

477
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,530
caught three good fish the first week . 
That 

478
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,770
told the boy 

479
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,570
to see the old man every day with his 
present, and he 

480
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,030
was always there to help him 

481
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,950

482
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,950
carry either the kuitlein or the gaff and 
harpoon, and the rope 

483
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,330
passed around the bulk. The 

484
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,450
sail was pitched with four floor 

485
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,570
sacks and furled it looked like the 

486
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,150
flag of permanent defeat. The old man 

487
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,250
was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles 

488
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,690
in the back of his neck. The brown 

489
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,470
blotches of a benevolent skin cancer 

490
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,190
the sun brings from its reflection on 

491
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,490
the tropic sea were on his cheeks. 

492
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,250
The blotches ran well down the sides 

493
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,610
of his face and his hands had the 

494
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,190
deep crease. ... 

495
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,670
So, now please characterize the old 

496
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,230
man by using the information that 

497
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,170
I've given in the text. Define the 

498
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,370
relationship between the two 

499
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,050
characters and explain your reasons. 

500
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,430
So, first characterize the old man. 

501
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,150
So, can someone tell me, please write 

502
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,990
in the box, yeah, some 

503
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,030
characteristics of the old man. Can 

504
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,030
you tell me? So, some important facts 

505
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,410
about the old man. For example, his 

506
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,910
behavior, how does he look like? So, 

507
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,110
oddward appearance. 

508
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,150
Any ideas? 

509
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,890
For example, so, we can tell about 

510
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,730
the old man that he was odd. So, 

511
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,490
then, here. 

512
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,410
The old man was thin and gone with 

513
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,310
deep wrinkles in the back of his 

514
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,210
neck. He 

515
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,380
had deep crease scars. 

516
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,620
Someone just gave him... He gave me 

517
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,220
an answer. He's 

518
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,560
disciplined when he doesn't give up 

519
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,200
fish. That's right. 

520
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,180
He's very disciplined and he 

521
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,880
really doesn't want to pass on fish. He's 

522
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,380
real about not 

523
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,220
wanting to pass on fish. That's a very 

524
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,960
important factor for this old 

525
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,420
man . That's the main part of the 

526
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,560
story, that the old man, even 

527
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,120
if he doesn't get fish, he is 

528
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,860
still fishing. He doesn't stop. Very 

529
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,880
good. And now the relationship 

530
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,620
between the two characters. So 

531
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,180
between the boy and the old man. Can 

532
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,260
someone tell me, how is the 

533
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,700
relationship? Is it good? Is it bad? 

534
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,980
Is it friendly? Is it peaceful? Is it 

535
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,600
like, are they enemies? What are 

536
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
they? Are they friends? Yes, 

537
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,280
they are friends and... Someone else 

538
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,600
typing. 

539
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,660
Okay, so they are friends. And you 

540
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,900
can... You can see that the old man 

541
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,620

542
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,360
has always taken the young boy fishing 
with him 

543
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,140
. But now, when the old man 

544
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,320
doesn't get any more fish, 

545
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,700
the young boy changes into a different 

546
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,880
boat. And now the young boy feels 

547
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,600
a little sad about it. But 

548
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,060
every evening when they come back, 

549
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,040
the young boy helps the old man to 

550
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,880

551
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,320
get the things out of this boat. So they 
are more, so they 

552
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,820
are friendlier, 

553
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,980
like before. So being friendly and 

554
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,840
everything, he gives it back, so he 

555
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,020
helps him now. Yeah. So the 

556
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,600
relationship between them is very 

557
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,860
friendly, very peaceful, and they are 

558
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,740
helping each other, but in different 

559
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,790
ways. It can be like, for example, 

560
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,890
emotionally. And so the old man, the 

561
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,710
young boy, emotionally, he's there 

562
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,230
for him. And he gives them, for 

563
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,610
example, hints of how he can do it. 

564
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,670
And the young boy now helps him 

565
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,110
physically with his power to 

566
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,590
transport things out of the boat. 

567
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,660
Plot. The plot of a narration 

568
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,500
consists of a series of events that 

569
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,240
are interconnected. The plot of a 

570
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,980
text always contains a starting 

571
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
situation, opportunities for action, 

572
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,360
a change of situation resulting from 

573
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,860
an action. In order to analyze the 

574
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,680
relevance of events, we have to 

575
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,840
identify their symbolic 

576
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,800
So when something happens, is it 

577
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,580
chronological or is it a 

578
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,740
flashback or what happens. This is 

579
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,380
important to get a sense of 

580
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,460
how the story is written. 

581
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,090
Climax. The climax is the part of the 

582
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,550
story where the highest point of 

583
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,670
tension is reached. This is 

584
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,470
usually the point where we 

585
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,610
find the main problem of the story, 

586
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,130
which is then 

587
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:03,830
closed by one or more main characters. 

588
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,350
This often results in a change. For 

589
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,870
example, the character constellation 

590
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,410
is affected because the relationship 

591
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,870
between two characters is 

592
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,590
strengthened or an argument is 

593
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,770
resolved. That's why the climax is 

594
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,450
also often referred to as a turning 

595
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,430
point. So a story is mostly built as 

596
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,590
there's a rising tension, then 

597
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,970
there's a climax. Like the main part 

598
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,330
is happening and then there's a 

599
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,090
falling tension. That's like... how 

600
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,630
the story is built. 

601
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,060
Open Ending. The ending is one of the 

602
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,860
most important parts of the story. 

603
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,840
We would also expect the 

604
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,340
story to come to an end. That's 

605
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,600
not always the case. Sometimes 

606
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,040
the end of the story doesn't give a 
resolution, 

607
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,460
but it is open. Therefore, the 

608
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,340
story could go in different directions 

609
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,820
and it is up to the reader to 

610
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,360
imagine the possible outcome. 

611
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,280
Thereby, Using an open end in a story 

612
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,560
motivates the reader to think and to 

613
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,180
deal with the subject matter of the 

614
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,240
text. Open endings are especially 

615
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,020
common in short stories. So, a story 

616
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,080
doesn't need an ending, but it also 

617
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,840
can have an open ending. And this is 

618
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,700
very common for short stories. 

619
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,130
So, possible tasks concerning the 

620
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,830
plot can be Describe the sequence of 

621
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,390
events of the story. How are the 

622
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,330
events interconnected? 

623
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,270
So all these questions are possible 

624
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,910
tasks you can get asked in an exam, 

625
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,170
like in an oral exam, whatever, in an 

626
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:56,530
essay. 

627
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,810
So, useful phrases for... The 

628
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,390
sequence of events. The story is told 

629
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,010
chronologically. The story disregards 

630
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,330
the chronological order. Later events 

631
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,370
are foreshadowed when the story 

632
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,410
switches from the present to the past 

633
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,970
or the other way around. An event 

634
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,730
marks a shift in time. The narrator 

635
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,610
uses retro-perspective narration too. 

636
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,010
An event anticipates future events. 

637
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,090
So useful phrases for the sequence of 

638
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,790
events. Useful phrases for the 

639
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,990
division of narration. The narrator 

640
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,230
tells the story in parts. Five parts, 

641
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,630
six parts, whatever. Two parts. The 

642
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,530
development rises to a climax when 

643
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,150
this and this happens. The story is 

644
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,170
organized in major events. Six, 

645
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,070
seven, one, two. The story can be 

646
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,610
divided into. The story has a 

647
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,950
surprise ending. Ending, whatever. 

648
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,450
and the event correlates with another 

649
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,170
event. So, these are useful phrases 

650
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,050
for the composition. That's it. Thank 

651
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,770
you for listening. Do you have any 

652
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,970
questions? Any questions, please 

653
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,750
write in the chat box. If not, yeah, 

654
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,930
thank you for listening. You can give 

655
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,110
me feedback if you want. Yeah. 

656
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,520
So, yes. I'm waiting for you to... 

657
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,940
Ask some questions or give me 

658
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,340
feedback. 

659
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,880
Thank you, Linus. So, at 11 there's 

660
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,420
another webinar with me. Another from 

661
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,220
the English Abitur series. And at 12 

662
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,260
there's another one. So, there's one 

663
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,260
at 11 and at 12. So, maybe we see 

664
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,980
each other again. And thank you for 

665
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,220
listening. So, if that's it, I would 

666
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,480
stop the webinar. I would end it. And 

667
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
I wish you good luck for your future 

668
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,080
exams, for your A-Levels, whatever. 

669
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,200
We see each other again, hopefully in 

670
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,180
one or two hours. We'll see. Thank 

671
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,240
you and bye. Have a nice day and good 

672
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,440
luck. Bye.
