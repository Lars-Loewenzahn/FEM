00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,860
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,440
Solving Equations Part 2. 

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,820
In this webinar , we will 

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,760

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,920

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,340
look at the root equation, the exponential 
equation and the logarithmic equation. 

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,880
We will first look 

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,320
at how to recognize each 

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,480
type of equation and then 

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,820
, of course, how to solve it. 

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,720
We will 

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,880
then present the solution method using a 
small 

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,020
example problem. Let's start with the 

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,320
root equation. 

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,720
You can always recognize a root equation 
by the fact that the 

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,100
variable is under the root. 

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,320
It is important that the variable 

18
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,780
is under the root in such a way that you 

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,020
cannot simply take the root. 

20
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,220
Here is an example. 

21
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,180
On the left we have a normal 

22
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,420
equation. This is not one, 

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,160
but several examples of 

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,220
normal equations. Here on the right we 

25
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,140
have examples 

26
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,360
of root equations. and we 

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,260
now have here 7 is equal to the root 

28
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,620
of 4x to the power of 2 minus 2. We 

29
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,700
only have one product under the root here 

30
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,160
, 4 times x². Consequently, we can 

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,440
take the root of 4 and 

32
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,700
x² and transform the whole thing to 

33
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,300
2x. This means that we can turn this 

34
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,560
equation into a normal equation 

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,780
, so this is not a 

36
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,700
root equation. A root equation 

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,520
is characterized 

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,980
by the fact that the x is under the root, 

39
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,600
so we can see this here, for 

40
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,340
example, root of x, which 

41
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,660
we cannot simplify any further, so 

42
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,420
it is a root equation. Root 

43
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,680
of 3 times d, in this case the d 

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,020
also stands alone, which means 

45
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,060
we can't really 

46
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,540
take the root of the d , if it 

47
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,780
were a d² , it would be the same case as 

48
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,280
here. Here we could use root 3 times d 

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,100
as a simplification 

50
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,640
, but in this case we haven 't. Therefore, 
it is a 

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,740
root equation. Below we have 

52
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,000
another example. At 

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,300
first glance , it looks similar to 

54
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,560
this one. The only difference is 

55
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,700
the following. Here we have 

56
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,660
an addition under the root and we 

57
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,540
cannot 

58
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,960
take the root from this term. That's why 
it's a 

59
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,120
root equation and we have to solve the 

60
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,500
root in other ways. 

61
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,190
If there is a normal number, something 
like 

62
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,710
a 2 or a 3 under a root 

63
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,030
, it is still a completely 

64
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,130
normal equation, because the 

65
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,690

66
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,670
calculator calculates the root of 2 or the 
root of 3 

67
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,390
without any worries. Well, let's move on 
to how 

68
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,970
to solve root equations. 

69
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,770
First of all, we want to 

70
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,190
transform the whole thing so that the root 
is on 

71
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,590
one side and everything else is 

72
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,990
on the other side. In other words, we 

73
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,970
try to 

74
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,770
isolate the root first. 

75
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,450
Once we have isolated the root, we square 
the 

76
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,350
equation. In doing so, we have to put 
brackets 

77
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,930
and then we also need, 

78
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,350
when we have squared it, 

79
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,310
we have a term in the bracket, which 

80
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,810
is squared. Therefore, to 

81
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,050
solve this term, we then need 

82
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,130
the binomial formula or one of the 

83
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,970
binomial formulas. If we 

84
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,190
have squared, the root is omitted. 

85
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,770
That's also the reason why 

86
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,350
we square it. And from this point on 

87
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,730
, we no longer have a root equation 

88
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,890
, but just a normal 

89
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,330
equation. So usually 

90
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,050
we end up with a quadratic equation 

91
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,170
, but there can also be equations 

92
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,690
of higher degrees or perhaps 

93
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,630
even just linear ones. 

94
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,830
Well, as I said, 

95
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,890
we then have to solve this equation . To 
do this, 

96
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,230
we first have to 

97
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,770
apply the binomial formula and 

98
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,770
then 

99
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,350
determine the solution for x. Determining 
the solution 

100
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,610
for x then depends on the... degree of 

101
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,970
the equation. 

102
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,230
We will use the equation 5 plus x 

103
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,130
equals 9 plus the square root of x. 

104
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,690
In the first step, we transform it so 

105
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,230
that the root of x stands alone. 

106
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,050
This is what is 

107
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,090
meant by isolating root. This means that 
the 9 must be added, 

108
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,930
so we calculate minus 9. 

109
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,810
5 plus x minus 9 equals 

110
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,790
the square root of x. Before we 

111
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,430
go to square it, 

112
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,310
we simplify everything as much as 

113
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,970
possible 5-9 we can calculate that 

114
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,550
is minus 4 so we get minus 4 

115
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,610
plus x that is equal to the square root of 

116
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,930
x and now we can't 

117
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,590
simplify it any further so we go 

118
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,030
to the second step and 

119
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,870
square it that means it is an 

120
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,950
equation so we 

121
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,930
always have to 

122
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,870
do the same thing on both sides we square 
minus 4 plus x 

123
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,610
so we write there we have minus 

124
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,890
4 plus x in brackets and square 

125
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,230
that. And we square the root 

126
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,410
of x. That s That's step 2. And now 

127
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,290
we start with step 3 and 

128
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,250
get rid of our root equation. Because 

129
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,410
the root of x to the power of 2, root and 

130
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,850
to the power of 2 equalize, is simply 

131
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,430
x. In other words, we now have minus 4 

132
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,610
plus x to the power of 2. That's an 

133
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,850
addition in here, 

134
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,390
so we can simply swap it to x minus 

135
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,170
4 to the power of 2 and that's how we get 
to this 

136
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,190
equation. This is a 

137
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,270
second-degree equation , so x-4 to the 
power of 2 is 

138
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,290
equal to x and 

139
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,910
we now have to solve this equation . In 
other words, in the next 

140
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,530
step we go and solve the 

141
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,890
binomial here. To do this, we need 

142
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,250
the binomial formula, in this case 

143
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,570
the second one, because we 

144
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,630
have a minus here. The second binomial 

145
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,050
formula is a-b, the whole to the power of 
2 

146
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,170
is equal to a²-2ab. plus b². 

147
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,430
Therefore, x minus 4 squared becomes x² 

148
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,730
minus 2 times 4x plus 4 squared. 

149
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,450
Minus 2 times 4x is minus 8x, plus 4 

150
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,430
squared is a plus 16, the x² 

151
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,490
remains the same and is equal to x. 

152
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,380
We now have a simple 

153
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,540
quadratic equation. 

154
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,280
We have to solve this as we always do, 

155
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,620
i.e. on the one hand 

156
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,080
we have a 

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
quadratic, a linear and an 

158
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
absolute term, i.e. the pq 

159
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,740
formula or the midnight formula can 

160
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,520
be used so that we 

161
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,780
can apply these, we must of course 

162
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,260
convert the whole thing to zero, so the 

163
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,720
x must be removed here, so we calculate 
minus 

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
x then we get x squared minus 

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,720
9x plus 16 is equal to zero if we 

166
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
use the pq formula, 

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,580
but we have to 

168
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,080
do one more thing. This is not necessary 
for us, 

169
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,600
because in our case the x² already stands 

170
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,880
alone. If this 

171
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,420
is not the case , it is essential to 

172
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,200
divide by the factor before the x². This 
means 

173
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,760
that if there is a 2 or a 

174
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,500
minus 1 here , then we first have to 

175
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,160
divide by the factor so that the x² 

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
stands alone. Only when the x² 

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
stands alone can we 

178
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,800
read off the p and the q, as we 

179
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,820
know it from the pq formula. It is 
important to note 

180
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,300
that p and q are always 

181
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,980
signed, which is why p is 

182
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,260
minus 9 and q is plus 16. The approach 

183
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,780
for the pq formula can be seen again here 

184
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,180
, x1.2 is equal to minus p half 

185
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,020
plus minus the square root of p half 

186
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,020
minus q. If we 

187
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,260
use minus 9 for p and 16 for q, we get 

188
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,660
here, so x1.2 is minus minus 

189
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,240
9 halves and the minus minus 9 halves 

190
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,340
plus minus the root of minus 9 

191
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,560
halves squared minus 16. Minus 

192
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,760
minus 9 halves is plus 4.5, so 

193
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,260
minus and minus is first plus and 

194
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,320
9 halves is 4.5. The 

195
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,600
sum of these under the root is 4.25. This 
means that 

196
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,080
for x1 we arrive at the solution 4.5 

197
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,740
plus the root of 4.25. That is 

198
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,300
approximately 6.56. 6. For x2 we 

199
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,260
arrive at 4.5 minus the root of 4.25. 

200
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,280
That is approximately 2.44. And these are 

201
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,480
already the solutions for 

202
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,000
our root equation. And that solves 

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,560
the root equation. 

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,940
This brings us to the 

205
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,020
exponential equations. 

206
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,880
Exponential equations are 

207
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,100
equations where our variable is in the 

208
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,820
exponent. Very importantly in the 

209
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,700
exponent, these are again 

210
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,160
quite... These are normal 

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,240
polynomial equations that we already 

212
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,960
know. These are 

213
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,400
exponential equations. Even with 

214
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
large exponents, with 

215
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,540
polynomial equations, they are still 

216
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,940
polynomial equations. 

217
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,360
However, as soon as we 

218
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,200
have a variable in the exponent , as here 
3 to the power of x, it is an 

219
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,960
exponential equation. Here, too, 13 

220
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,120
to the power of 2x. 

221
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,660
However, an exponential equation 

222
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,860
only has to 

223
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,820
have the variable in the exponent at one 
point. This means 

224
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,680
that we have 11x minus x to the power of 
53. 

225
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,060
That would be a normal 

226
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,140
polynomial equation, but then 

227
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,320
on the other side it says that it 

228
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,440
equals 13 to the power of 2x plus x to the 
power of 4. 

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,900
This is the part that 

230
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,680
ultimately turns the equation into an 

231
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,420
exponential equation. And how 

232
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,000
we solve it is what 

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,220
we're going to look at now. First of all, 
we 

234
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,240
reshape the equation. 

235
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,680
We reshape the equation so 

236
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,100
that our power alone... one on 

237
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,560
one side and 

238
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,800
the rest on the other side. So we isolate 

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
the power. This is always the case. 
Regardless 

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
of whether we have a root equation, 

241
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,220
an exponential equation or 

242
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,400
a logarithm equation. 

243
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,640
We always isolate first. So the root, 

244
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,860
the power or the logarithm. 

245
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,400
In this case, of course, the power. We 

246
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,780
isolate our power. Everything else 

247
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,720
we want to 

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,960
have on the other side . and then we start 

249
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,100
to work on the equation. if we 

250
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,380
have an exponential equation 

251
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,860
, we work with the logarithm 

252
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,960
. the logarithm can 

253
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,320
get our variable from the exponent 

254
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,160
. we can see that right away. that means 
we 

255
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,880
solve our 

256
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,240
exponential equation with the logarithm . 
that is 

257
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,920
step 2. and then in step 3 we have 

258
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,140
a normal equation 

259
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,720
. we can also see that here our equation 

260
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,640
is in this case 43 is equal to 7 plus 

261
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,340
3 to the power of x. 

262
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,300
As I said , the first step is to isolate 
the power. That 

263
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
means we have to remove the 7, 

264
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,720
the 3 to the power of x should stand 
alone. 

265
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,540
We therefore calculate minus 7, 43, 

266
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,580
minus 7 is 36 and 36 is then equal to 

267
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,480
3 to the power of x. Step 1 is now 

268
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,820
complete and we can 

269
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,160
start with step 2 and apply the logarithm 

270
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,540
. This means that we now 

271
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,840
apply the logarithm, importantly on 

272
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,960
both sides. There are different 

273
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,280
logarithms. There is the logarithm 

274
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,020
to the base 10, which is the LG or 

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,680
LOG, which are both 

276
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,080
abbreviations for it. And there is the 

277
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,400
LN, the logarithm naturalis. This 

278
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,720
has the base E, i.e. Euler's 

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,320
number E. The ln is always 

280
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,340
used if 

281
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,580
Euler's number e is used as the base. If 
you 

282
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,600
have other bases, such as 

283
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,620
3 in our case , then you simply use 

284
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,860
the normal logarithm lg or log 

285
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,620
and work with this. 

286
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,820
The difference between the two 

287
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,520
logarithms is, as already mentioned, the 
base. 

288
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,960

289
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
However, the arithmetic laws and the 
application do not change. 

290
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,320
Good. We now apply the logarithm 

291
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,740
, i.e. the logarithm of 36 is 

292
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,900
equal to the logarithm of 3 to the power 
of x. 

293
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,520
And now comes the reason why we 

294
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,000
actually use the logarithm 

295
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,560
, because there are 

296
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,880
logarithmic arithmetic laws. 

297
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,660
We need these and the 

298
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,540
logarithm of a to the power of b is equal 
to b 

299
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,720
times our logarithm of a. 

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,720
This means that the law of logarithmic 
arithmetic 

301
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:29,400
allows us 

302
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,480
to take our exponent from above and 

303
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,940
move it in front of it. In other words, we 
can get our 

304
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,700
variable from the exponents. 

305
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,620
And so the logarithm of 3 

306
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,880
to the power of x becomes x times the 
logarithm of 3. 

307
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,300
And we can see that this is 

308
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,700
another very simple equation 

309
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,960
, because the logarithm of 36 is the 

310
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,840
number that can be calculated. 

311
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,280
and the 

312
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,660
logarithm of 3 is also a 

313
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,520
number that the calculator 

314
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,200
can determine, so it 

315
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,380
just says the number is equal to x times 
the 

316
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,380
number, which means that we now 

317
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,280
simply divide by the 

318
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,520
logarithm of 3, where it says the 

319
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,300
logarithm of 36 divided by 

320
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,020
the logarithm of 3 is equal to x, 

321
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,800
which means that we 

322
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,720
enter 3.61 in the calculator, which is 
then x. 

323
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,840
I would also advise you 

324
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,320
not to immediately round it off like this 
at the back. I 

325
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,820
would enter the total into the 

326
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,500
calculator 

327
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,740
and then write down the result at the end. 
This 

328
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,620
is much more accurate. And 

329
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,540

330
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,740
now we have already solved our exponential 
equation . Our x is 

331
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,540
then 3.61. 

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,020
And that brings us to 

333
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,660
our last type of equation, which 

334
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,800
is the logarithm equation or the 

335
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,260
logarithm equations. 

336
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,980
You can recognize a logarithm equation 

337
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,380
by the fact that the variable is in the 

338
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,020
logarithm. Which 

339
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,400
logarithm you have, i.e. ln 

340
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,520
or log, does not matter at first. 

341
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,780
The only important thing is that the 
variable is 

342
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,640
not the exponent in the logarithm 

343
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,660
, in this case 3 to the power of x. This 

344
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,080
is the case we just 

345
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,440
had, because the 

346
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,980
law of logarithmic arithmetic allows us 

347
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,480
to make it x times the 

348
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,060
logarithm of 3 and then it is 

349
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,700
no longer a logarithmic equation yes 

350
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,600
so the variable must be the base if 

351
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,180
it already occurs something like logarithm 

352
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,860
x to the power of 3 we can 

353
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,300
also draw the three in front of it we have 
three times 

354
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,860
the logarithm of x but our 

355
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,680
variable x is ultimately still 

356
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,960
in the logarithm so it's a 

357
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,260
logarithm equation yes so with 

358
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,820
logarithm equations our 

359
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,520
function variable or our 

360
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,740
variable is in the logarithm and 

361
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
we can't get that 

362
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,700
out of it using a logarithm arithmetic 
law. 

363
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,160
The theory of how to transform this is 

364
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,180
that you try to have the logarithm 

365
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,120
on one side and 

366
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,800
the rest on the other. In other words, 

367
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,080
you want to 

368
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,260
isolate the logarithm first. What I 

369
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,020
said earlier is always our 

370
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,120
first step. Then 

371
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,740
we try or want to solve the logarithm 

372
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,900
. We do this 

373
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,720
by exponentiating with the base. 

374
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,960
This is very important, exponentiation 
with 

375
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,940
the base . In other words, as I' 

376
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,100
ve just said, the normal 

377
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,000
logarithm, which 

378
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
is abbreviated log or lg , has a base of 
10. 

379
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,680
We'll see that in a moment. The 

380
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,620
logarithm naturalis ln, which also 

381
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,660
often occurs, has the base e, i.e. 

382
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,080
Euler's number e. If we 

383
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,460

384
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,180
have the logarithm naturalis ln in an 
equation, we exponentiate with 

385
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,680
Euler's number. E. This is very 

386
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
important, not with the 10, but 

387
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,600
we'll see that in a moment. Thirdly, if 

388
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,220
we have exponentiated, we have 

389
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,040
a normal equation again , we can see that 

390
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,880
straight away, and we can 

391
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,540
simply calculate it. We 

392
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,300
may sometimes need 

393
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,820
a few 

394
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,140
logarithm calculation rules in some places 
, but 

395
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,800
we already need to know them for the 

396
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
exponential equation anyway. This brings 
us 

397
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,200
to our 

398
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,620
example. Here we have the 

399
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,040
logarithm of 5 minus x bracket to 

400
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,440
is equal to minus 22 minus the 

401
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,400
logarithm of x. As just 

402
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,380
mentioned, we first isolate our 

403
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,880
logarithm. The problem 

404
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,120
here is, of course, that we have two 

405
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,960
logarithms and we first have to 

406
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,960
combine them and for this we need the 

407
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,480
logarithm arithmetic laws. 

408
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,520
But first we have to 

409
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,400
get them on one side. We do this by 

410
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,620

411
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,960
getting the logarithm of x on the other 
side. Here we have minus the 

412
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,860
logarithm of x. Consequently, 

413
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,680
we calculate plus the logarithm of x. And 

414
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,980
then there is the logarithm of 5 

415
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,680
minus x plus the logarithm of x 

416
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,760
is equal to minus 22. And now 

417
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,600
we have to 

418
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,800
make a logarithm from these two logarithms 
. 

419
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,980
We do this 

420
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,520
by applying the law of logarithmic 
arithmetic. 

421
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,680
If two logarithms 

422
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,720
are added together, we can also 

423
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,640
multiply the values in here within 

424
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,660
a logarithm. In other words, from the 

425
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,720
logarithm of 5 minus x plus the 

426
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,060
logarithm of x, we can make 

427
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,640
the logarithm of 5 minus x times x. 

428
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,120
So we can 

429
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,860

430
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,980
multiply the values that are here in the 
logarithm with each other and 

431
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,120
then write them into a logarithm . 

432
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,240
Now we have 

433
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,220
isolated the logarithm. The logarithm 

434
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,900
of the term is equal to minus 22. 

435
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,600
Next comes step 2 

436
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,380
, namely, we want to 

437
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,100
get rid of the logarithm , so we 
exponentiate 

438
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,820
with the base. We have the LG here, 

439
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,820
which means that it has a base of 10, 

440
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,580
so we exponentiate with 10 

441
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,420
. To the power of 10, the 

442
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,720
logarithm of 5 minus x times x is 

443
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,320
equal to 10 to the power of minus 22. So 
everything 

444
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,660
that is here on the left-hand side 

445
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,220
ends up in the exponent of 

446
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,040
10. Everything that is here on the 
right-hand 

447
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,460
side will later be in the 

448
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,700
exponent of 10, only on the 

449
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,360
right-hand side. Why we 

450
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,620
do all this is because 10 to the power of 
the 

451
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,400
logarithm of the term in here 

452
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,260
is just the term that' 

453
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,040
s in here. Exponentiating by 10 

454
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,800
solves the logarithm. solves the 

455
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,840
logarithm. So we arrive at 5 

456
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,140
minus x times x equals 10 raised to the 
power of 

457
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,100
minus 22. We can already see 

458
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:27,140
that this is a very simple, um, very 

459
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,960
simple quadratic equation. I'll 

460
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,680

461
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,540
come up with the same second degree. And 
as I said, here 

462
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,420
again the hint, attention 

463
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,140
logarithm rules, we definitely need them 

464
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,420
up there. where we 

465
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,980
have added the logarithms and so 

466
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,540
we are now already at the part that 

467
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,500
actually works normally 5 

468
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,480
minus x times x equals 10 to the power of 
minus 22 

469
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,080
we also multiply that so that 

470
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,240
we 

471
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,880
can use our pq formula again so 5 times x 
are 5x minus x 

472
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,080
times x are minus x squared and that 

473
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,380
is equal to 10 to the power of minus 22. 

474
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,540
We now set this to 

475
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,860
0 at the top . Then it says 5, so 
calculate minus 

476
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,400
10 to the power of minus 22. This is then 
5x 

477
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,180
minus x² minus 10 to the power of minus 
22. 

478
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,260
Now we have the 

479
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,220
case just mentioned. Our x² has 

480
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,740
a minus. Therefore, before we can use the 

481
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,300
PQ formula, we have to 

482
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,840
multiply by times minus 1 

483
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,080
or divide by minus 1 

484
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,700
. This means that the signs 

485
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,040
must be reversed. We then 

486
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,140
have to 

487
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,480
multiply everything by times minus 1 , 
i.e. the 5x, the 

488
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
minus x² and the minus 10 to the power of 
minus 

489
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,940
22. We then arrive at minus 5x plus 

490
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,460
x² plus 10 to the power of minus 22 equals 

491
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,020
0. The exponent is never 

492
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,060
changed. So even if you 

493
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,120
calculate with times minus 2, the exponent 

494
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,360
above always remains the same. The 

495
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
sign is not changed. 

496
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,860
Now let's rearrange this again briefly 

497
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,560
and arrive at x². Minus 5x plus 10 

498
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,420
to the power of minus 22 equals 0. Our p 

499
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,540
is therefore minus 5, our q is 10 

500
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,940
to the power of minus 22. Here we can see 
another 

501
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,900
approach for our pq 

502
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,880
 formula. This is the same 

503
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,800
procedure as before. We put it 

504
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,380
all in and come up with minus, 

505
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,840
minus 5 half, plus minus, the square root 

506
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,200
of minus 5 half, minus 

507
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,340
10 to the power of minus 22. 10 to the 
power of minus 22. 

508
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,040
That's such a small number that it 

509
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,240
gets lost in the rounding. That's why 

510
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
what's written underneath 

511
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,160
is now simply the square root of 6.25 

512
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,340
or 2.5 squared. 

513
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,000
So x1.2 is then equal to 2.5 

514
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
plus minus the square root of 6.25. That 

515
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,360
means x1 is 5 and x2 is then 2.5 

516
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,240
minus 2.5, i.e. 0. 

517
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,420
You could have estimated the whole thing 
up here 

518
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,560
, because that... This is a 

519
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,940
number that 

520
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,380
is already very close to 0. And if you 
then 

521
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,040
make a rough calculation, consider it as 0 

522
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,560
and 

523
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,860
use the 0 product theorem 

524
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,140
, you would have had x1 equal to 0 and x2 
equal to 5 and you would have 

525
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,160
had the same results. This is a 

526
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,320
trick that always works if 

527
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,560
you have an equation where you 

528
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,860
have a product here and it 

529
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,060
is approximately 0. This is then a 

530
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,500
rough calculation and 

531
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,580

532
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
you have to end up in the range that you 
calculate here. 

533
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,860
Of course, this is the calculation that 

534
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,020
has to be carried out in any case. 

535
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,240
What I have just said is 

536
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,860
rather optional for checking purposes, 

537
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,140
or to check the 

538
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,820
plausibility of the whole thing. That 
brings us to 

539
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,300
the end of the webinar. 

540
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,340
Thank you very much for 

541
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,400
your attention.
