00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,870
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,310
Schülerhilfe webinar. I'm 

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,750
Serena and today we're talking about 

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,510
bodies. First of all, I'd 

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,530
like to ask you what 

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,790
level of chaser you are. 

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,910
Exactly. Okay, so very, very important 

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,230
first. It's important to me that you 

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,850
walk out of the webinar 

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,350
having learned something and 

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,110
having fully understood everything. That 
means 

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,490
that you' 

13
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,470
re welcome to ask questions at any point 
or, 

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,470
if you want me to 

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,210
repeat something or we 

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,590
do an assignment again , then 

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,490
please just let me know. I'm open to 

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,910
anything. Right, then I'd 

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,650
say let's get started. As I said, I 

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,950
'm Serena. I've been working at 

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,070
Schülerhilfe since June and I'm 

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,870
also studying law and 

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,590
political science. So 

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,510
today we're going to start with the 
bodies. 

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,270
First of all, we're going to discuss the 

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,310
cone, then the sphere and then the 

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,370
pyramid. 

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,480
So, our first solid, the cone. 

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,180
With the cone, the 

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,260
circle 

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,980
is used as our base. The tip lies 
centrally 

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,080
above the center of the circle and the 

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,880
lateral surface connects the 

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,460
tip and the base. 

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,160
The volume of the cone is one 

36
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,100
third of the volume of a cylinder 

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,960
and our formula looks 

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,400
like this. So V equals 

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,180
one third Pi times R to the power of 2 
times H. Since 

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,640
we only 

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,700
want one third of the volume of the 
cylinder for the cone, 

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,700
so to speak, we have to 

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,160
insert one third in front of it. Now the 

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,880
surface of the cone. This 

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,140
consists of a circle as the base surface 
and 

46
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,360
the lateral surface. So once here, 

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,020
this is our base surface and 

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,580
this is our lateral surface. 

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,360
The lateral surface is a 

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,180
section of a circle, as you can see here. 

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,880
So you can see the 

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,440
lateral surface unfolded here and this is 

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
just a section of a circle, because 

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,900
a circle would actually 

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,680
continue here. Exactly. So, the 

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,100
base area is calculated 

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,060
by multiplying pi times R to the power of 
2. 

58
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,200
The lateral area, the formula looks 

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,540
like this, pi times R times S. And the 

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,220
total area, we then add 

61
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,640
the two areas that we 

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,140
have just calculated. So, 

63
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,080
that's where the formula comes from. 

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,200
Pi times R to the power of 2 plus Pi times 
R times S. 

65
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,800
So S is the 

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,680
lateral surface, i.e. the length of the 

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,420
lateral surface, H is the height and R 

68
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,560
is the radius of the base surface, i.e. 

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,520
the circle. So, with the sphere. 

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,580
The properties of the sphere are such 

71
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,600
that a sphere is created by 

72
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,460

73
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,160
rotating a circle around its own center. 

74
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,420
The only necessary quantities 

75
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,100
are the radius. Because the radius 

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
is the same here and here 

77
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,780
, here or here. So 

78
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,700
it's always the same, that's why 

79
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,460
we only need the size r. 

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,300
So, how do we calculate the 

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,840
surface area of a sphere? We 

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,180
calculate this by multiplying 4 times pi 

83
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,420
times r to the power of 2. The volume 

84
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,560
, on the other hand, we triple the 

85
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,160
whole thing, as we 

86
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,180
already did earlier with the volume of a 

87
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,080
cone. And that becomes 4 

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,580
thirds times pi times R to the power of 3. 
Very 

89
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,480
important, why to the power of 3? Because 
we 

90
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,060
have to go up once here, to the 

91
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,780
side there and down once. Because the 

92
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,360
volume is 

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,860

94
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,360
multiplied by 3 side lengths and so the 
whole thing 

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,040
becomes cubic. Cubic centimetres or 

96
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,260
cubic centimetres. So, then the 

97
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,980
pyramid. 

98
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,840
The base of the pyramid is shaped 

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
like a square. 

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,100
Just a moment, I'll make a quick note 

101
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,620
because that's a mistake. It shouldn 

102
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,200
't be called a square, but a quadrilateral 

103
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,400
. Just a moment. On slide 

104
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,600
9, 

105
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,330
okay, good. Then it's also very 

106
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,850
important to emphasize that the 

107
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,870
lateral surface of this... is made up of 

108
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,450
triangles. So here we have 

109
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,450
the lateral surface, which is 

110
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,550
made up of these 

111
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,130
different triangles. 

112
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,270
Then we have the tip here 

113
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,670
and that's where all the 

114
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,330
lateral surfaces, i.e. all the 

115
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,650
triangles, meet and they end up here 

116
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,750
at the top , so to speak. So, how do you 
calculate 

117
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,130
the volume of the pyramid? 

118
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,450
The volume is one third of the 

119
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,010
volume of a prism, because it 

120
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,270
still has the same base area. 

121
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,510
So, depending on the base area, 

122
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,310
different formulas have to be used to 

123
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,990

124
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,110
calculate the volume of the pyramid. Here 
we have the 

125
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,190
formula for this, 1 third times a of g 

126
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,450
times h. h is our height here, 

127
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,410
i.e. from the base 

128
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,970
at a right angle up to the 

129
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,420
top. So, then the top right 

130
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,040
content of the pyramid. How do 

131
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
we calculate this? It is very important to 
mention in advance 

132
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,200
that, depending on the base area, there 

133
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,740
are different 

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,200
numbers of triangles as niches. 

135
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,920
So we can 

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,420
have a square here , i.e. a 

137
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,520
quadrilateral, and then have 

138
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,240
four triangles here, for example. 

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,200
But you can also have just three triangles 

140
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,960
or even more. 

141
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,860
In other words, a pyramid of squares 

142
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,040
here would have four competing 

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
equal triangles. 

144
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,320
Equal isosceles simply means that 

145
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
the two side lengths are equal. 

146
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,820
So, to 

147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,380
calculate the area of the individual 
triangle 

148
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,040
, you then have to 

149
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,920
calculate h of a times a by 2. 

150
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,360
So, a is this triangle. now 

151
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,320
calculate it. Then the lateral area of 

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,560
four triangles. How do we do this 

153
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
? We simply multiply it by 

154
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
four, because we 

155
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
have four triangles in this case. 

156
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
However, because we 

157
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
also have two at the bottom here , this is 
shortened 

158
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
and only 

159
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,800
one two remains. So our 

160
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,900
formula derives 2 times h from a times the 

161
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,040
height of a and the length a . So, 

162
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,780
how do we calculate the 

163
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,040
base area? We 

164
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,200
simply have to multiply a by a. So 

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,960
a times a, because that is simply a 

166
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,980
square and we just have to 

167
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,660

168
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,520
multiply the two side lengths together. 
And 

169
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,740
then we arrive at the result a to the 
power of 2. 

170
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,220
For the total area, it looks like 

171
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,200
the sum of the 

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
base length... lateral area. So 

173
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,860
once from this square here and 

174
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,700
from these four triangles. And the 

175
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,180
whole thing looks like this. So we 

176
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,220
add the two things together and 

177
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,460
get a to the power of 2 plus 2 times h 

178
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,150
from a times a. So now we have 

179
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,490
an example task here. A 

180
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,110

181
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,170

182
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,490
conical roof with a height of 

183
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,690
3 meters is to be placed on a cylindrical 
tower with a circumference of 25 meters . 
Now 

184
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,410
we want to 

185
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,430
calculate the volume of the roof space and 
the area of the roof that 

186
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,100
can be seen from the outside. So 

187
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,760
we have just given 

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,540
the circumference 25 meters and the height 
3 

189
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,680
meters. What do we have to do? 

190
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,940
First we have to 

191
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,440
calculate the radius of the cone. 

192
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,080
We do this by using the formula 

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,320
for the circumference and then 

194
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,140
simply transforming it. It 

195
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,620
looks like this: r equals u divided by 
2pi. 

196
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,360
Then we 

197
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,740
insert all the known quantities, i.e. 25 
meters in this case 

198
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,400
. We know 

199
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,740
that the circumference is this big and 

200
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,520
then divide it by 2pi 

201
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,040
to get 3.98 meters. Now 

202
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,520

203
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,620

204
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,980
that we have the radius, we want to 
calculate the volume . The formula for the 

205
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,520
volume is 1 third times pi times R 

206
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,420
to the power of 2 times H and we then 

207
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,040
insert our newly known size, 

208
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
namely the radius, oh 

209
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,820
sorry, I'm just one 

210
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,420
back and also our other 

211
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,720
known size, namely the height, and 

212
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,940
then we get 49.76 

213
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,220
cubic meters as the volume. This means 
that 

214
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,000
our volume of the roof space is approx. 49 

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,280
.76 m³. So now we have 

216
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,680
calculated the radius and 

217
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,500
the volume. Now 

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,300
we also want to 

219
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,500
calculate the area. However, 

220
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,140
because there is a 

221
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,060
right-extreme triangle in the cone 

222
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,300
, we can then 

223
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,480

224
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,840

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
calculate the side length, i.e. the roof 
slope S, using the Pythagorean theorem . 

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,840
Here we have the height and the 

227
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,680
radius and can then 

228
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,400
easily calculate our length S. 

229
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,040
We do this by 

230
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040

231
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,700

232
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,780
calculating S to the power of 2 as H to 
the power of 2 plus R to the power of 2, 
i.e. the typical Pythagorean theorem , 
then we take a 

233
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,220
root over it so that we 

234
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,880
get rid of the power of 2, then 

235
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,600
insert our known quantities for this, 

236
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,260
once h and once r, and 

237
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,560
then we get 4.98 meters for S. So, 

238
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,540
with the help of the Pythagorean theorem , 
we have 

239
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,750
calculated our roof pitch S. 

240
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,830
Now let's 

241
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,910
calculate the lateral surface area. The 
area 

242
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,710
that is only seen from the outside. 

243
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,510
Our formula is pi times R 

244
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,210
times S. And we'll 

245
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,810
simply 

246
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,730
use the known values again. One is the 
radius and 

247
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,650
the other is the roof slope S. 

248
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,250
We have just calculated these. 

249
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,110
And then we arrive at the result 

250
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,030
of 62.27 square meters. This means 

251
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,630
that the 

252
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,650
area visible from the outside is approx. 
62.27 m². So 

253
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,930
this is our shell area. 

254
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,530
Now we have another 

255
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,330
example task. In this one, 

256
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,190
we want to 

257
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,450

258
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,390
calculate the surface area and volume of a 
20 m high square pyramid. 

259
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,830
The side length of the base is 6 m, so 

260
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,230
here a equals 6 m. And because 

261
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,570
the pyramid is square, as 

262
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,230
stated in the task, we know 

263
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,310
that all sides are the same length 

264
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,970
, i.e. all sides 

265
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,810
are 6 m each. So, the height is 20 m, 

266
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,710
i.e. from the base 

267
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,510
up at a right angle to the top 

268
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,370
is 20 m. What do we have to do now 

269
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,590
? Our first step is to 

270
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,190
calculate the volume. 

271
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,270
We know that the base area 

272
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,570
is a square. This means that we 

273
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,890
only have to calculate a to the power of 
2, 

274
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,550
so 6 m to the power of 2 is 36 m². This 

275
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,370
means that our base area 

276
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,730
is 36 m². So, our formula for 

277
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,090
the volume of a pyramid is one 

278
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,150
third times a of g times h. Now 

279
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,630
we just use our known 

280
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,210
quantities, namely a times the 

281
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,390
base area, which is 36 

282
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,810
square meters, and a times the 20 meter 

283
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,630
height, which we already 

284
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,310
know from earlier. And that gives us 240 

285
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,650
cubic meters. This means that the 

286
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,230
volume of the pyramid is 240 m³. 

287
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,110
Now we also know that the 

288
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,070
surface area is 

289
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,670

290
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,190
made up of the base area, i.e. the square 
at the bottom, the base, and 

291
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,070
the lateral surface area, i.e. the 

292
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,190
outer perimeter, the triangles. 

293
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,230
We now also calculate 

294
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,390
how the base area 

295
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,510
is very, very square by 

296
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,250
simply taking the length to the power of 
2. That 

297
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,150
's in these voltex meters and that 

298
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,530
's 36 square meters. The 

299
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,170
surface area is made up of the 4 

300
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,130
equal triangles. 

301
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,050
We now need the 

302
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,150
height of A, i.e. of these 

303
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,410
triangles. How do we do that? 

304
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,630
We do this by forming a 

305
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,490
right triangle within the 

306
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,830
pyramid, i.e. this one. Because 

307
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,610
we want this side, 

308
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,050
but we already have this one and this one, 
because this 

309
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,430
is the height and this side 

310
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,030
is simply half of one 

311
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,050
of our sides of the base. It 

312
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,610
's kind of like the radius. So once 

313
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,110
from here to the center. And 

314
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,010
logically that's 3 meters. This is 

315
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,590
our formula for it. We 

316
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,950
simply use the 

317
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,970
Pythagorean theorem again to 

318
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,510
calculate this length here. So h of a to 
the power of 

319
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,270
2 equals 0.5 a to the power of 2 plus h to 
the power of 2. 

320
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,230
Then we put the 

321
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,050
different sizes back in and 

322
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,950
get 

323
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,370
20.22 meters for this length here, i.e. h 
of a. 

324
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,640
We can then use this size to 

325
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,620

326
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,100
calculate the area of the triangle, i.e. a 
triangle of the lateral surface. 

327
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,120
So, to calculate the triangle 

328
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,120
, we then put 

329
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,560
all the sizes back into this formula a 

330
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,420
times h of a by 2, which is our 

331
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,380
formula for calculating the 

332
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,240
triangle and then get 20.22 

333
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,160
meters. 6.6 square meters. Now 

334
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,260
we want to 

335
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,460

336
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,280
calculate the lateral area and the total 
surface area. How do we do that? We 

337
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,140
just do the lateral surface. 

338
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,000
We have to 

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,820

340
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,840
calculate the lateral surface area by 

341
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,740
multiplying a triangle by 4, because there 
are 4 

342
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,080
triangles, and then we arrive at 

343
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,260
the result of 242.64 square meters, 

344
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,540
which is the 

345
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,600
lateral surface area of the pyramid. Now 
let's 

346
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,960

347
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,140
calculate the total surface area. So we 

348
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,320
now have the lateral surface area, 

349
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,960
but we still need the base area. 

350
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,580
We've already 

351
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,720
calculated this before , so we 

352
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,840
just have to add it all together. So 

353
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,160
once the lateral surface area, i.e. the 

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,800
area of the lateral surface area plus 

355
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,100
the area of the base area. 

356
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,480
And then we arrive at the result of 

357
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,640
278.64 square meters. This means that 

358
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,400
the surface area of the 

359
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,180
entire pyramid is 278.64 square meters 

360
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,230
. So, that's all 

361
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,010
for today. I was very 

362
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,890
pleased that you were able to attend the 

363
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,110
webinar from Schülerhilfe. Do you have 

364
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,270
any more questions? 

365
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,990
Okay, if you don't have any more questions 

366
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,870
, then I'll say goodbye. 

367
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,230
I hope not today, but not before 

368
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,470
I 

369
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,950
refer you to the online learning center. 
There you can 

370
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,930

371
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,050
do exercises on this topic, but also on 
other topics, and 

372
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,670
then also check yourself, 

373
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,310
because there are the corresponding 

374
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,510
solutions. There 

375
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,610
are, among other things, the subjects 
math, as well as 

376
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,770
English and German. So 

377
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,730
feel free to 

378
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,950
drop by and work on a few 

379
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,290
worksheets there. 

380
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,890
Thank you very much for... your attention 
and 

381
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,870
for being there. That was three 

382
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,430
different bodies for you. 

383
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,890
Have a nice evening and 

384
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,250
I'll say goodbye for today. 

385
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,470
Take care!
