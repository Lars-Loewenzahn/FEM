00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,900
Advanced Methods of 

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,140
Differential Calculus. 

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,420
In this webinar we will 

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,780

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,300
deal with function sets and also limits. 
Before we start the 

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,720
actual webinar 

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,520
, it would be nice if you could 

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,420
write a quick yes or okay 

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,300
in the chat at the bottom right 

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,320
. Just so that I 

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,620
know that you can hear me and 

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,380
that we 

14
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,320
can start the webinar as usual. You can 
hear me 

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,100
, that's wonderful. Then 

16
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,540
we'll start right away. If you have 

17
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,320
a question about something, 

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,820
just put it in the chat and 

19
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,080
I can come back to it 

20
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,320
and explain it again, the 

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,140
relevant part. Here are 

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,700
our topics for today. We' 

23
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,340
ll 

24
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,080
look at function damage, 

25
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,800
a locus curve of function damage 

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,360
and then we'll look at 

27
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,040
limits and the rule of del 

28
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,660
hospital let's start with the 

29
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,820
function sets function sets 

30
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,880
are simply functions that 

31
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,700
still have a parameter this parameter 

32
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,500
is often an a and by means of this 

33
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,120
parameter the curve can 

34
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,640
be changed again or you 

35
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,060
can 

36
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,260

37
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,620
map several function equations with a 
function set as shown here , so these 

38
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,020
are all 

39
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,940
function equations that 

40
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,300
come from this function set. 

41
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,360

42
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,620

43
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,780
For example, a conventional, completely 
rational function, as we have always 
treated it, 

44
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,720
is this one. f of x is equal to x² plus 4x 

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
minus 1. You can see that there is 

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,260
really only x as a variable here. In 

47
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,580
the function set, there is a parameter in 
addition to the 

48
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,080
variable x. Please 

49
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,780
note that such a parameter 

50
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,440
is really treated like a number 

51
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,940
and not like a variable 

52
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,860
. 

53
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,400
The main differences 

54
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,460
between functions and 

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,180
function sets are, so the good 

56
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,540
news for you is that 

57
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,080
all criteria remain the same. 

58
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,860
This means that zero constraints and 

59
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,740
sufficient conditions for 

60
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,640
zeros, inflection points and 

61
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
extreme points remain the same. 

62
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,900
The solution of these, i.e. the 

63
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,320
solution set, is... for normal 

64
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,900
functions is always a number or there 

65
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,880
is none. With function sets, 

66
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,780
the solution is often 

67
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,700
dependent on the given parameter. This 

68
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,420
means 

69
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,040
that the result is not x equals 5, but 
something like 

70
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,820
x equals a plus 3. This 

71
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,420
happens more often and you have to get 

72
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,220

73
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,740
used to it and adjust accordingly. 

74
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,900
Here we see a function equation 

75
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,050
for today. fk of x is equal to k times 

76
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,410
x by x² plus 1. k is, as 

77
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,490
I said, our damage parameter. 

78
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,010
And now let's just go 

79
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,390
through a little curve discussion. We'll 

80
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,330
start with the zeros. 

81
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,510
For zeros, we 

82
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,630
simply set the function set 

83
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,410
equal to 0. Very importantly, this is 

84
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,550
actually a fractionally rational 

85
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,810
function. You can see this from the fact 
that 

86
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,010
the variable also appears in the 
denominator, 

87
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:23,830
in this case x². Therefore, 

88
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,950
if we 

89
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,310
equate the function with 0, we must or can 
simply 

90
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,010
take the numerator term, i.e. equate k 

91
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,830
times x and d with 0. This 

92
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,390
has to do with the fact that if we 

93
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,810
get a 0 in the numerator here , 

94
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,650
the function value... automatically 
becomes 

95
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,350
0. And that's why we simply search 

96
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,450
the numerator polynomial for 

97
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,750
zeros. And so we arrive at 

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,610
0 is equal to k times x, which we 

99
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,150
then convert to x, i.e. we divide by 

100
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,150
k, because the k is just any 

101
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,490
number and then it says x0 is equal to 

102
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,970
0. And it is very important that the 

103
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,130
zeros of the fractional function 

104
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,210
do not depend on the denominator 

105
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,730
, as we will 

106
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,710
hear more often in this webinar. 

107
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,140
Let's move on to the extreme points. 

108
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,420
In order to calculate the extreme 
position, 

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,020
we must of course first 

110
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,360
derive the equation of the function. The 

111
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,740
first derivative of a fractionally 

112
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,300
rational function equation 

113
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,320
must always be 

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,820
calculated using the quotient rule. This 
is described above, 

115
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,220

116
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,340
but the quotient rule is not part of this 

117
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,000
webinar. Nevertheless, I will explain it 

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,020
briefly. Let's 

119
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,200
imagine it like this, the function is 

120
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,180
constructed. We have our 

121
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,320
function equation u of x at the top and 

122
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,100
our v of x at the bottom. And now to 

123
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,520
create the derivative, we go 

124
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,920
and calculate u' of x times v of x 

125
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,300
minus v' of x times u of x by v². 

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,780
Our u of x, as I just 

127
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,780
said, is k times x. Our v of x 

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,480
is x² plus 1. And now 

129
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,060
we simply create u' and v' by simple 

130
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,360
derivation. So u derived from x is 

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,220
simply k, so u'k and 

132
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,920
v' from x is then 2x, which is simply 

133
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,940
the derivative of x² plus 1. So 

134
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,200
we get k times x² plus 1 to 

135
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,320
minus 2x times kx, the whole thing divided 

136
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,560
by x² plus 1 to the power of 2. 

137
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,980
You should always 

138
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,140
leave this binomial down here simple if 
possible 

139
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,580
, it just makes things 

140
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,960
a bit easier. you 

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,100
have to derive again later. In the 
numerator above, 

142
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,480
you should simplify everything that 

143
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,440
is possible. For example, you can 

144
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,520
go here now and 

145
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,280
simplify minus 2x times kx , 

146
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,440
but this is not so 

147
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,480
important if you 

148
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,160
want to calculate the extreme points 
immediately. As you 

149
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,040
can see, the first derivative was 

150
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,840
immediately equated to 0. This 

151
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
means that we can now look directly 

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,020
at the numerator and 

153
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,260

154
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,020
examine it for a zero. We then arrive at 0 

155
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,580
is equal to k times x² plus 1 minus 2x 

156
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,340
times kx. Now we 

157
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,140
summarize this 2x times kx and 

158
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,700
dissolve the bracket. The bracket is k 
times 

159
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,020
x², which is simply kx² and k times 

160
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,960
plus 1, so plus k and 2x times kx 

161
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,600
equals minus 2kx². 

162
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,060
And we can now go here. 

163
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,700
We have kx² and minus 2kx². That 

164
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,000
's minus kx² together. The plus k 

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,500
remains. And we see that we have 

166
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,960
both as a function of k. It is therefore 

167
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,540
possible for us to 

168
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,340
factor out one k. We do the same 

169
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,380
here. Now we have the k in front of it. 

170
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,480
And now the parenthesis is open. to 

171
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,360
minus x² plus 1, parenthesis closed, and 
because 

172
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,940
the k is in front of it, we can simply 

173
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,380
divide by the k. And then 

174
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,540
you see , we have suddenly 

175
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,620
eliminated our parameter. As 

176
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,780
I said, this doesn't always work, it's 

177
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,020
a special case here, because our 

178
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,320
solution is the same, as you 

179
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,080
can see below , regardless of k. 

180
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,840
After we have divided by k, 

181
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,180
we have 0 equals minus 

182
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,240
x² plus 1, which is a very simple 

183
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,180
quadratic equation. 

184
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,900
You simply calculate plus x², then 

185
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,480
x² is equal to 1 and 

186
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,820
then you take the root and arrive at 

187
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,060
the solution 1 and minus 1. 

188
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,980
Then you 

189
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,100
still or usually calculate the 
y-coordinate. 

190
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,820
We do this here simply by 

191
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,500

192
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,400

193
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,020

194
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,760

195
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,340
substituting our solution, as we know it 
from all other completely rational 
functions, into the original function f of 
x, i.e. fk of x in this case. We 

196
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,380
now 

197
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,140
insert 1 or minus 1 for the x here. That 
was 

198
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,420
the solution just now. And so we 

199
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,720
arrive at k times 1 by 1 squared plus 

200
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,320
1. And that is simply k halves, so 

201
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,140
1 squared is also 1. 1 plus 1 

202
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,720
is then 2. k times 1 is the k. 

203
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,590
Both minus 1. it works almost exactly the 
same. 

204
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,330
We have k times minus 1 by minus 1 

205
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,170
to the power of 2 plus 1. Minus 1 to the 
power of 2 is 

206
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,150
also 1. Please make sure that the 

207
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,410
minus is omitted. And so we 

208
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,330
arrive at minus k half. This means 

209
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,430
that we can now say that 

210
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,840
there is a high point at point 1 

211
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,380
and a minimum at point 2 

212
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,220
if 

213
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,080
k is not zero, so the option that 

214
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,800
the parameter is zero is usually 

215
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,220
excluded. unfortunately, we 

216
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,640
haven't had a definition range here yet 

217
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,860
, but if k were zero, we would have 

218
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,220
zero half here and here we would 

219
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,840
also have minus zero half, which would 
also be 

220
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,820
zero. then of course both 

221
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,200
points would lie on the x-axis, but 

222
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,040
then the whole function would also 

223
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,420
lie on the x-axis. So that won 

224
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,800
't happen. 

225
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,050
What is also noticeable is that our x 

226
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,170
-coordinate is not dependent on k, 

227
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,770
simply 1 or minus 1, but the y 

228
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,350
-coordinate contains our 

229
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:49,010
chart parameter k. Therefore, the type of 

230
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,310
our extrema is also dependent 

231
00:09:53,310 --> 00:10:04,930
on k. So if our k 

232
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,330
is less than 0, then there would be 
something 

233
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,430
negative here and then suddenly 

234
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,970
E2 would be the high point and E1 the 

235
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,070
low point. Yes, because k could also 

236
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,410
take on negative values. If we suddenly 
had 

237
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,730
a minus here and here 

238
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,970
we would have a minus-minus and 

239
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,190
minus-minus would be plus again. And so 

240
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,550
the high point would 

241
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,130
swap with the low point. 

242
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,990
Normally, if the extreme points 

243
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,550
or whatever or inflection points 

244
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,450

245
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,670
are dependent, if the x-coordinate is also 
dependent on the damage parameter, 

246
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,610
you always calculate a locus curve. 

247
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,130
and this locus curve is simply 

248
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,650
the graph or the curve on which 

249
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,530
the extreme points are then 

250
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,750
located. the strategy for doing this 

251
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,150
is always written down. 

252
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,770
of course, you first have to 

253
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,990
calculate with extreme points using the 
necessary 

254
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,830
criterion and then you have to 

255
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,890
calculate the y coordinate, i.e. points 

256
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,870
1 and 2 are quite normal extreme points 

257
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,910
. the really exciting part 

258
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,350
is now at point 3. and 

259
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,530
we take one of the two 

260
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,330
coordinates, i.e. either the x 

261
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,070
or the y coordinate. I would 

262
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,910
recommend taking the x-coordinate. 

263
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,870
And this is 

264
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,910
converted to the parameter. And after this 

265
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,130
has been converted, it is inserted into 
the 

266
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,370
other point. Don't 

267
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,630
worry, we'll do that in a minute. 

268
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,210
Of course, we now have the 

269
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,650
small problem that 

270
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,250
our x-coordinate was independent 

271
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,950
of the damage barometer, so 

272
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,250
let's first look at a different 

273
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,890
functional equation, which is the 

274
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,870
functional equation x squared plus a x 

275
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,690
plus 1 and this functional equation 

276
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,330
is a completely rational function 

277
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,650
, which we now first examine for 

278
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,410
extreme points, i.e. first 

279
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,610
we form the first derivative, which 

280
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,370
is 2x plus a and this first 

281
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,830
derivative must of course be 

282
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,850
set equal to zero We have also 

283
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,230
done this here. 0 is equal to 2x plus a 

284
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,830
and now we go and 

285
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,710
convert to x. In other words, first 

286
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,890
we calculate minus a. Then it says 

287
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,950
minus a equals 2x. And now 

288
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,990
we divide by 2 and then 

289
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,770
it says minus a half is equal to 

290
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,490
our x. In other words, the x for our 

291
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,550
extreme point. And now comes 

292
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,670
step 2. We insert this x, minus 

293
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,390
a half, into the equation of the function 
to 

294
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,070

295
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,850
calculate the y-coordinate . That is, we 
would get f a 

296
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,370
from minus a half. And that is equal to 

297
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,590
minus a half squared plus a times 

298
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,530
minus a half plus 1. Please 

299
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,550
note, minus a half squared is 

300
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,050
a quarter of a squared. The minus 

301
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,390
of this comes from the fact that we have 

302
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,950
a quarter of a square and this 

303
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,550
back here a times minus a half is minus 

304
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,880
a half squared. In other words, we 

305
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,800
have, I'll write 

306
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,160
about it briefly , here we 

307
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,260
have a quarter and here we have 

308
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,300
minus one and a half. That is then 

309
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,500
again minus a quarter squared 

310
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,900
, of course. And the plus 1 

311
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,290
also remains. So we end up with minus 

312
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,990
a quarter of a square plus 1 and that is 

313
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,090
our y-coordinate. In other words 

314
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,290
, we have the extreme point 

315
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,350
minus a half and minus a quarter of a 

316
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,410
square plus 1. As 

317
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,390
I said, this is our x-coordinate and this 

318
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,550
is our y-coordinate. And in the next 

319
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,870
step, to create the locus curve 

320
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,830
, we simply go and 

321
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,950
take our x-coordinate and 

322
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,190
transform it to a. Our 

323
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,790
 x-coordinate is simply x is 

324
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,950
equal to minus a half, we 

325
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,190
now transform this to a, so we calculate 
times 

326
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,250
2, it says 2x is equal to minus a. 

327
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,870
Let's calculate times minus 1 so that 

328
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,770
the sign is changed. And 

329
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,490
now we know that a is equal to minus 

330
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,930
2x. And that's exactly what we now use 

331
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,530
for this a. So we 

332
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,130
now enter minus 2x for the a here. 

333
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,770
You can see that here too. 

334
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,470
It still contains the a and now it 

335
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,050
suddenly contains minus 2x to the power of 
2. 

336
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,250
We now have minus 1 quarter times minus 

337
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,470
2x squared plus 1. Minus 2x and 

338
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,410
the whole thing squared is simply 4x 

339
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,730
squared. And minus 1 quarter times 4x 

340
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,110
squared is simply minus x squared 

341
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,550
and the plus 1 remains. So 

342
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,830
the locus curve is then minus x 

343
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,710
squared plus 1. and we can see that 

344
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,170
here. you can see that the 

345
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,690
bold purple is the locus curve 

346
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,750
we have calculated and these are the 

347
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,330
different function equations 

348
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,370
for different parameters and you 

349
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,230
can see all the low points lie on 

350
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,390
this locus curve well 

351
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
that's it for now 

352
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,300
we would then start with 

353
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,240
limits do you have a 

354
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,920
question about this. 

355
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,940
I said, if you have a question, 

356
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,320
feel free to write it. 

357
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,180
Okay, I'll just 

358
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,980
carry on and we'll start with 

359
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,280
limits. 

360
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,260
To define a limit, 

361
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,280
we first need an 

362
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,380
assignment rule, something like a n 

363
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,100
is equal to n plus 1 or a 

364
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,240
function term. The only problem 

365
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,960
with such fractionally rational 

366
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,420
function terms, where there is also an x 

367
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,380
in the denominator, is that they 

368
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,340
are not defined for all numbers. 

369
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,400
Because, as you can see here, 

370
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,000
under no circumstances can we 

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,800

372
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,960
have a 0 in the denominator of a fraction 
. So if we have something like 

373
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,880
n tends to 3 and we have 1 

374
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,340
through n, then that would be a third. 

375
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,520
Here, where we have x-3² in the 
denominator 

376
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,720
and if we suddenly 

377
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,180
insert a 3 here , we can no longer 

378
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,840
calculate a function value. 

379
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
In other words, we cannot 

380
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,100
calculate a limit value. Quite simply 

381
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,440
because then there is a 0 in it and the 

382
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,460
thing is no longer defined. That 

383
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,240
's bad. That's why there are 

384
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,780
ways of calculating limit values 

385
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,240
. In the following, we will 

386
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,460

387
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,760
calculate this beautiful function equation 
And we let our x 

388
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,280
move towards minus 1 Minus 1 is 

389
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,680
of course the denominator zero This 

390
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,160
means that if you 

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,840
insert a minus 1 here , you have a zero in 
the denominator 

392
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,020
This means that you cannot 

393
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,500
simply insert it And now 

394
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,620
our calculation techniques for limit 
values come 

395
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,540
into play One possibility is to 

396
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,340
simply approach minus 1. 

397
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,580
That is, once from the left, you get 

398
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,600
very close, and once from the right. 

399
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,560
You see here minus 1.1 and minus 0 

400
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,600
.9 and here always the function values 

401
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,960
of these. And you can already see that at 

402
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,400
minus 1.01, which is already very close 

403
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
to minus 1, we have a 

404
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,520
function value of minus 0.49. At 

405
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,200
minus 0.99, we are a little 

406
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,160
to the right, and to the right of that we 
have the 

407
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,060
function value minus 0.51. So you 

408
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,600
could now assume that 

409
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,140
the limit value is minus 0 

410
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,240
.5 in between.  That's one possibility 

411
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,180
that you could assume. But in 

412
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,600
mathematics, it's always 

413
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,100
difficult if you only 

414
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,560
assume things. So 

415
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,920
of course we also want to be able to 
calculate it. And 

416
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
that's why we have this second 

417
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,760
option. The problem with this 

418
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,900
second option is that it' 

419
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,760
s quite a tricky calculation 

420
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,960
because we're trying to 

421
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,300
factorize everything first. You can see 
here 

422
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,880
that we have now 

423
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,460
written this in two brackets that 

424
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,380
are multiplied together and 

425
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,780
I think you can also see that we have 

426
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,200
the same ones twice here. We have 

427
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,020
an x plus 1 

428
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,220
squared in both the numerator and the 
denominator . That means 

429
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,820
we can then shorten it out. And then 

430
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,960
all that's left is x plus 1 divided by x 
minus 

431
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,380
2. 

432
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,090
Or it has to be 

433
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,330
the other way round, it's an error. 

434
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,810
That means x plus 2 divided by x minus 1. 

435
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,970
And we now put the minus 1 

436
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,570
in there. Then it says minus 1 plus 2, 

437
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,470
which is the 1st and minus 1 minus 1 

438
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,190
system minus 2 and so we come to 

439
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,670
minus 0.5 so we have now 

440
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,470
really calculated the limit value the 

441
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,170
problem with this method is just 

442
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,370
to 

443
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,030
get here from this equation so the 
simplest or the 

444
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,530
only way to really do it is 

445
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,030
you would have to 

446
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,430
calculate all the zeros and then 

447
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,970
write it down factorized . This takes a 
long time 

448
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,910
and is quite complicated. That's why 

449
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,250
there's a great rule from 

450
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,210
Dell Hospital that makes it 

451
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,490
much easier. 

452
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,990
This is the third way to 

453
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,310
solve this. Namely, we have a 

454
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,890
numerator function f of x and a 

455
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,970
denominator function g of x. And 

456
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,730
unfortunately we have the form that if we 

457
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,910
now insert our value x equal to minus 1 

458
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,970
into the denominator function, 

459
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,450
we get a 0. And 

460
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,010
now we simply go there. Derive the 
numerator 

461
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,090
and denominator once. But we are 

462
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,110
really deriving the numerator function for 
itself 

463
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,590
and the denominator function for itself 

464
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,210
once. So we use... 

465
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,530
not the 

466
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,730
quotient rule in the following. Here is 
the 

467
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,250
proof again. If we 

468
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,670
replace the minus 1 , we have 

469
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,090
a 0 in the numerator and in the 
denominator. Therefore, we can apply the 

470
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,570
rule and 

471
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,470
form the first derivative. In other words, 

472
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,590
the first derivative was 

473
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,870
formed here. So in the numerator 

474
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,990
, x to the power of 3 plus 4x² plus 5x 

475
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,930
plus 2 was derived , which is then 3x² 
plus 8x 

476
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,870
plus 5 and the denominator was also 

477
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,370
derived, x³ plus x² minus x minus 

478
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,990
1, which is then 3x² plus 2x minus 1. 

479
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,530
And there you would then 

480
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,250
insert it again and unfortunately you 
would again 

481
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,310
find that a 0 

482
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,570
comes out twice , which means you derive 

483
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,270
the numerator and denominator a second 
time 

484
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,530
. So we derive 3x² plus 8x plus 

485
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,050
5 and get 6x plus 8 and 

486
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,490
3x² plus 2x minus 1 we also derive 

487
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,830
and get 6x plus 2. Now 

488
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,730
we put in our minus 1 again 

489
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,150
and we realize that this time 

490
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,470
minus 1 also comes out half. And 

491
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,870
so we have also 

492
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,930
determined the limit here. 

493
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,870
We are now at the end of the 

494
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,290
webinar. We have a few 

495
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,710
minutes left to 

496
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,810
answer questions. In other words, if you 

497
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,050
have any questions, please feel free to 

498
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,830
ask them. But thank you 

499
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,450
very much for your 

500
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,210
attention. And if you 

501
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,530
have no more questions, we're 

502
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,690
done , as I said. I'd like to wish you a 

503
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,510
good evening and you 

504
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,110
can leave the room. 

505
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,110
But I'll stay in the 

506
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,190
room a little longer in case you 

507
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:24,910
want to ask another question. 

508
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,640
Thank you too.
