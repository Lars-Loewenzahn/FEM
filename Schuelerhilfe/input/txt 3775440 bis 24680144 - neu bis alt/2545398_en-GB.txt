00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,460
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,000
Binomial Formulas webinar . In 

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,420
this webinar , we will be looking at the 
three 

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,160
binomial formulas. I 

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,720
will explain them and also 

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,060
briefly derive them so that we all 

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,760
know where they come from or how 

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,080
they are composed. 

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,500
We will then look at how we 

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,940
can apply the binomial formulas, i.e. how 
we 

11
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,660
can recognize them and whether we 

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,700
can convert them or something with them. 

13
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,480
Finally, we will look 

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,940
at simplifying fractions and 

15
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,460
roots using the binomial 

16
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,020
formulas and I would say that 

17
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,640
we will now start directly with the 

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,960
first binomial formula. The first 

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,140
binomial formula 

20
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,840
looks like this: it is a bracket 

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,780
to the power of 2 and the bracket contains 
a 

22
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,460
plus b, which means that the bracket 
contains 

23
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,380
an addition. And 

24
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,980
we can now also 

25
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,440
write this parenthesis to the power of 2 
as a product, i.e. 

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
parenthesis on a plus b. parenthesis to 
times 

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,100
parenthesis on a plus b parenthesis to if 

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,640
we now 

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,460
multiply these two parentheses out we 
calculate a times a 

30
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,760
that is a squared a times b that is 

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,420
then plus ab then b times a b times a is 

32
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,880
the same as a times b therefore 

33
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,100
we have also written here plus 

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,560
a times b and still b times b and that is 

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,260
then b squared we now see 

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,580
here we have ab plus ab and that is 

37
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,140
then together 2ab. The first 

38
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,720
binomial formula can therefore be 

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,420
solved by a² plus 2ab plus b². 

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,920
We also have a small 

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,780
example of this. In this case, 

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,560
of course, we see that a and b are two 
numbers, 

43
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,640
so a is 5, b is 2. We therefore have 

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
no variable or parameter 

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,760
in the binomial formula. This means 

46
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,580
that in such a case, we could also 

47
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,080
calculate the value in the brackets first. 

48
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,260
In this case, that would be 5 plus 2, i.e. 

49
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,980
7. And 7 to the power of 2 would be 49. In 
this case, 

50
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,340
you could therefore 

51
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,660
bypass the binomial formula. However, we 
will 

52
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,700

53
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,340
see many cases in the course of the 
webinar where it is not so easy to 

54
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,600
work around this and where the binomial 

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,040
formulas are absolutely necessary. 

56
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,920
In other words, this is simply an 

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,460
example where it doesn't necessarily 

58
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,540
have to be. But we will 

59
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,000
see plenty more examples where it is 
necessary. 

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,900
So if we 

61
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,660
have a variable or a parameter in the 
brackets. 

62
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,540
But let's just break it 

63
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,760
down . In our case, a is 5 and b 

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,200
is 2. And so we get 5 to the power of 2 

65
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
plus 2 times 5 times 2 plus 2 to the power 
of 2. 

66
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,320
Let's start on the left. 5 to the power of 
2 is 

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,580
25. 2 times 5 is 10. 10 times 2 is 

68
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,380
20 again. And 2 to the power of 2 is 

69
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,300
4. 25 

70
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,440
plus 20 plus 4, that's all together, 

71
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,680
or the sum of these is 

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,680
49. And 

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,300
we would also have arrived at 49 if we 

74
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,000
had calculated 7 to the power of 2. In 
other words, we 

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,180
have probably calculated correctly. 

76
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,710
This brings us to 

77
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,250
the second binomial formula. The 

78
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,550
second binomial formula 

79
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,390
differs from the first in 

80
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,250
that it 

81
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,370
now has a 

82
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,150
minus sign instead of a plus sign. This 
means 

83
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,710
that instead of addition, 

84
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,990
subtraction takes place within the 
brackets 

85
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,430
. Here, too, we have the 

86
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,530
format, parenthesis open, a minus b, 

87
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,250
parenthesis closed, to the power of 2, 
i.e. a 

88
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,850
parenthesis is squared . This means that 
in 

89
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,190
this case, too, we can 

90
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,550
multiply the two brackets together 

91
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,870
to resolve the power. So a 

92
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,290
minus b times a minus b. In other words 

93
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,490
, we simply multiply this 

94
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,710
out and get our solution. A 

95
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,470
times A is A², A times minus B is minus 

96
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,050
AB, then minus B times A is also 

97
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,270
minus AB and now, very 

98
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,890
importantly, minus B times minus B, 

99
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,790
so we have minus times minus, which is 

100
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,270
plus, so we have plus B². So 

101
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,230
we arrive at a²-2ab±2ab. 

102
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,770
And we can see that the difference 

103
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,850
in the result compared to the 

104
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,490
first binomial formula is that 

105
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,070
we now have a minus here, 

106
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,170
previously there was a plus. So in 

107
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,370
the second binomial formula 

108
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,890
, there is a minus in the brackets 

109
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,930
and 

110
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,290
a minus in front of the two ab-parts in 
the solution. 

111
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,250
We also have an example of this 

112
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,790
and this is now an example that 

113
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,850
we 

114
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,290
could no longer solve using a specific 
value in the brackets. 

115
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,630
Unfortunately, we now have to apply the 

116
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,770
binomial formula. In this 

117
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,230
case, a is 3 and b is 4x. 

118
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,630
It is very important that b is 4x. 

119
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,610
In other words , we use this and arrive at 
3 

120
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,210
to the power of 2 minus 2 times 3 times 4x 
plus 

121
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,670
parenthesis to the power of 2. This 

122
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,730
means that it is very important that we 

123
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,030
square the 4 and 

124
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,070
square the x straight away. Because we are 
squaring 4x 

125
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,730
and not just the x. That's why it's 

126
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,270
also put in brackets here. And 

127
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,350
then let's just work it 

128
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,510
out. 3 to the power of 2 is 9. minus 2 
times 3 

129
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,810
is minus 6. and minus 6 times 4x is 

130
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,610
minus 24x. And 4x squared. 4 

131
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,030
squared is 16. And x 

132
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,490
squared is simply x². So we 

133
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,910
get 9 minus 24x plus 16x². And that's what 

134
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,590
we get using the second 

135
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,640
binomial formula. This brings us 

136
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,120
to the third 

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
binomial formula. The third 

138
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,660
binomial formula is always quite 

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,740
easy to recognize. The third 

140
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,420
binomial formula does not have 

141
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,480
a power of 2. It is simply 

142
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,540
two brackets 

143
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,280
that are multiplied together. One 

144
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,940
bracket contains a plus b, the 

145
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,440
other a minus b. This means 

146
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,780
that there is an addition sign in one and 

147
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,580
a subtraction sign in the other. 

148
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,180
And the two numbers are 

149
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,200
the same in each case. Of course, you can 
also 

150
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,320

151
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,500
derive this third binomial formula first. 
This means that 

152
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,400
if we 

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,840
multiply out the two brackets , we also 
have a times a, a 

154
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,660
squared, a times minus b, is minus ab. 

155
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,120
ab and then b times a, that's 

156
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,840
plus ab, here you can already see it, 

157
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,700
minus ab plus ab and now we have 

158
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,020
plus b times minus b, that's minus b², 

159
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,700
in this case we only have a minus 

160
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,040
and therefore we have minus b² and 

161
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,680
now you can 

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,740
summarize the whole thing , minus ab plus 
ab 

163
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,740
falls out, that cancels itself out and 

164
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,020
what remains is a² minus b² and that 

165
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,400
is then already the solution of the 

166
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,560
third binomial formula. 

167
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,370
Here we have a small 

168
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,530
example. 3 plus 2 times 3 minus 

169
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,110
2, this is of course another 

170
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,070
example where we don't 

171
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,170
necessarily need the third binomial 

172
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,190
formula, because we could 

173
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,830

174
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,050
simply carry out the addition up to the 
subtraction . 3 plus 2 is 5 and 

175
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,250
3 minus 2 is 1. In other words, it says 

176
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,750
5 times 1, which means that the 

177
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,890
result must be 5 , but 

178
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,970
we will now check this using 

179
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,970
the binomial formula. The solution 

180
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,470
of the third binomial formula 

181
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,350
is a²-b². In our case, the 3 

182
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,490
is the a and the 2 is our b. So 

183
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,330
we get 3 to the power of 2 minus 2 to the 
power of 2 and 

184
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,890
that is then 9 minus 4 and 9 minus 4 

185
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,930
is then correspondingly 5. That means 

186
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,710
we would have 

187
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,210
calculated that correctly in our heads. 
The only important thing here is 

188
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,350
that the determinant value within the 

189
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,890
brackets only works as long as 

190
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,310
we 

191
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,750
have no variables and no parameters and 

192
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,190
we usually have these, so we definitely 

193
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,470
need the binomial formulas. 

194
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,090
This brings us to 

195
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,490
the topic of how to recognize binomial 
formulas 

196
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,350
. 

197
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,350
Unfortunately, recognizing binomial 
formulas is not 

198
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,650
all that easy. It is something that 

199
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,630
primarily takes place through practice. 

200
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,850
This means that when you do exercises on 

201
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,030
binomial formulas 

202
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,650
, you simply develop an eye and a feel 

203
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,370
for the square numbers on 

204
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,530
the one hand and for 

205
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,590
when you 

206
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,590
can create or apply a binomial formula on 
the other. This 

207
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,230
means, of course, that we have to 

208
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,590
learn the structure of the binomial 
formula 

209
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,190
and recognize certain patterns. 

210
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,910
We can learn the structure in 

211
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,610
this webinar. So we 

212
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,470
can take a closer look at the structure 

213
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,090
and see where 

214
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,090
it comes from. The problem is that 

215
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,050
recognizing patterns is 

216
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,130
something that unfortunately 

217
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,770
only happens through practice. You 

218
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,630
can, or I can now, 

219
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,530
and I will, teach you a few things 

220
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,830
that you 

221
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,790
can pay attention to. And so that 
recognizing such 

222
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,730
patterns is perhaps a little quicker 

223
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,250
. But unfortunately there is no way 

224
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,810
around practicing. This is where 

225
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,910
we start with the conversion, 

226
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,550
so that we can now 

227
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,570
apply the binomial formulas to convert 
something. 

228
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,810
In other words, on the one hand we have 

229
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,690
the classic example here , we have a 
bracket 

230
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,410
and this bracket is squared and 

231
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,210
we are supposed to solve it. In other 
words 

232
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,170
, this is done using the binomial 

233
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,990
formulas. If we 

234
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,070
have the power raised to the power of 2, 
we already know 

235
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,810

236
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,910
that it cannot be the third binomial 
formula. Therefore, it is 

237
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,170
either the first or the second. 

238
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,370
We can see that we have a plus 

239
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,270
in here. Therefore, it is definitely the 

240
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,490
first binomial formula. And we 

241
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,770
have simply defined it like this. The 

242
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,990
number to the left of the plus sign is our 

243
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,330
a. The number to the right of the plus 
sign 

244
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,870
is our b. This means that our a 

245
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,130
in this case is 2. And our b is c. 

246
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,570
2ab plus b², which in our case now means 

247
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,470
2 to the power of 2 plus 2 times 2 times c 
plus c². 

248
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,790
2 to the power of 2 is 4, 2 times 2 times 
c is 

249
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,630
4c and c to the power of 2 is simply c to 
the power of 2. 

250
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,910
And so we have 

251
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,990
already solved this bracket. Of course, 
there' 

252
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,790
s also the other way around and 

253
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,110
that's actually always the bigger 

254
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,590
problem, where you 

255
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,950
need this exercise to recognize certain 

256
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,610
patterns . We can 

257
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,350
already see a 

258
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,890
solution to a binomial formula here, if 
you like, but 

259
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,330
we now want to 

260
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,770
generate the binomial again. This means 
that we have 64 b² 

261
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,810
minus 80ab plus 25a². And now 

262
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,510
we have to think about what 

263
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,430
our a was and what our b was . We'll 

264
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,370
just go and say that the 

265
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,610
leftmost square is our a square, 

266
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,730
which means that if we 

267
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,090
take the root of the 64 b square, we get 
our a 

268
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,830
square, which means that the root of 64 b 

269
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,470
square is 8 and 

270
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,250
the root of b square is b, which 

271
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,050
means that our a is 8b, which is the 
number 

272
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,210
or term to the left of 

273
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,770
our addition or 

274
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,210
subtraction sign. We 

275
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,350
still have to work out which binomial 

276
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,290
formula we can make from this. 

277
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,830
First of all, we see here that we have an 
AB 

278
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,170
 part and we have an A² part. 

279
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,750
This means that if we have B², AB and A² 

280
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,210
, then this tells us in any case 

281
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,550
that if we 

282
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,730
have the first or second binomial formula, 

283
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,490
if we had the third then we would 

284
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,450
only have b to the power of 2 or a to the 
power of 2 or 

285
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,510
other parameters or variables to the 

286
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,590
square this ab part tells us we 

287
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,090
can make the first or second 

288
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,950
binomial formula from it we 

289
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,910
also see a minus here that means 

290
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,110
we can make the second 

291
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,350
binomial formula from here because it 

292
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,550
contains this and we have 

293
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,530
already found out and our a is 

294
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,090
8b. This means that if we 

295
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,730
divide 80ab by 8b, 

296
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,010
we get 10a. Now it's 

297
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,570
still 2ab, which means we have to 

298
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,130
divide by 2 again and then we 

299
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,250
get 5a. This means that 5a 

300
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,070
is our b. 

301
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,470
We can also calculate the whole, or the 
5a, 

302
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,850
by taking the root... from the b² 

303
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,290
now. This is actually also 

304
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,650
the easy way, but you should 

305
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,530
definitely 

306
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,490
check it again with this. This means that 
the square root 

307
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,630
of 25a², the square root of 25 is 5, 

308
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,590
the square root of a² is a, which means 
that 

309
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,310
our b is 5a. And 

310
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,330
now we have everything we 

311
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,830
need for the binomial formula. We have 

312
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,390
clarified that we need to create 

313
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,550
the second binomial formula . Our a 

314
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,950
is 8b and our b is 5a. This means 

315
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,230
that we can turn these terms into, 

316
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,890
open parentheses, 8b minus 5a, close 
parentheses, 

317
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,590
to the power of 2. And to 

318
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,270
do something like this, you simply need 

319
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,970
a certain amount of practice so that you 
know 

320
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,510
how best to proceed. That brings us 

321
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,710
to 

322
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,070
a few example tasks. 

323
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,530
The first 

324
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,330
example problem we see here is opening the 
parenthesis, b plus 

325
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,950
3d, closing the parenthesis, to the power 
of 2. We see that 

326
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,390
we have the parenthesis to the power of 2, 
so it 

327
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,510
is definitely the first or 

328
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,750
second binomial formula that we 

329
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,550
need. We also see 

330
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,110
an addition in here , a plus sign. 

331
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,430
This means that we have the first 

332
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,250
binomial formula. The solution 

333
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,030
is therefore a² plus 2ab plus b². 

334
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,310
Now we just have to apply it here 

335
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,630
. In our case, our a 

336
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,270
is the b and our b is the 3d. 

337
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,570
This means that we have b to the power of 
2 plus 6 

338
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,430
bd plus 3d squared. We have to 

339
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,350
square the 3. That is the 9 then. 

340
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,730
3 to the power of 2 is 9 and the d. That's 
how 

341
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,850
we get this plus d squared. That 

342
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,030
is very important. Then the 

343
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,510
next example is a plus c times a 

344
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,130
minus c. We see that we have an 

345
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,270
addition and a 

346
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,110
subtraction. There is no 

347
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,390
power in the brackets here. 

348
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,350
This means it is the third binomial 

349
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,750
formula. 

350
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,330
It always contains the same values. And 

351
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,690
now we 

352
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,070
simply carry out the third binomial 
formula. The solution to 

353
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,750
this is a² minus b². 

354
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,290
In our case, a is our a, our b 

355
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,850
is b. the c and so we arrive at a² 

356
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,490
minus c². 

357
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,830
Here we have the 

358
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,550
third example again. We see that we 

359
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,330
already have the solution to a binomial 

360
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,130
formula, i.e. the same problem 

361
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,650
as before, and we are now supposed to 

362
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,970
create the binomial from it. 

363
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,310
First of all, we see that we have 169 
minus 26b plus 

364
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,190
b². That means we have three 

365
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,890
elements, we can't 

366
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,250
summarize it any further , so it won't 

367
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,990
be the third binomial formula. It 

368
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,270
's the first or the second again. 

369
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,690
We now have a minus here again 

370
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,950
. Consequently, we can turn it into 

371
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,690
the second binomial formula. 

372
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,450
Now, of course, we have to think about 

373
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,090
our a and our b. That's 

374
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,330
our a² here. In other words 

375
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,070
, we calculate our a by 

376
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,130
taking the square root of 169. The square 
root of 

377
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:03,270
169 is 13, which is our b². 

378
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,530
We get our b by 

379
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,290
taking the square root here. This means 
that our b is 

380
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,030
b in this case. 

381
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,510
We now know which binomial formula we 

382
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,150
have and how big a and b are, 

383
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,770
namely 13 and b. 

384
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,890
As I said, the minus arises from the fact 
that we 

385
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,070
know directly that we have to 

386
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,290
apply the second binomial formula because 
there 

387
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,410
is a minus here. So that's how we 

388
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,630
get to parenthesis open, 13 minus b 
parenthesis to 

389
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,650
the power of 2. And that's how you can 

390
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,770
solve such problems. This brings us 

391
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,490
to our last topic. This 

392
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,530
is the simplification of fractions and 

393
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,690
also the simplification of 

394
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,290
roots. So now it's about 

395
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,670
simplifying terms using the 

396
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,790
binomial formula. 

397
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,770
Let's start by looking at a fraction. 

398
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,150
16x²-24x±9 by 16x-12 and now 

399
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,510
we can simplify 

400
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,610
the fraction by factoring it 

401
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,530
. This means that we 

402
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,450
factorize the numerator and the 

403
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,790
denominator, i.e. we express the 

404
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,270
numerator or denominator by products 

405
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,810
, i.e. by multiplication and 

406
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,670
the aim is, of course, 

407
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,110

408
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,190
to have the same term in the numerator and 
the denominator so that we 

409
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,050
can reduce it. And we can 

410
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,330

411
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,590
create a binomial out of this in the last 
task. That 

412
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,170
is 4x-3². This is our 

413
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,350
a² again and the root of 16x² is 

414
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,030
4x. The square root of 16 is 4 and 

415
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,810
the square root of x² is x. That is 

416
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,030
our b². This means that our b is 

417
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,410
the root of 9 or 3. And the 

418
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,150
minus tells us again that we 

419
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,850
need the second binomial formula. 

420
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,290
Consequently, we can 

421
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,130
express the numerator using brackets on 4x 
minus 

422
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,230
3 brackets to the power of 2. Now, 

423
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,690
of course, we consider whether we 

424
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,210

425
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,070
can also express the denominator using 
this term. And yes, 

426
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,530
we can , because 4 times this term is also 

427
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,630
our denominator. So 4 times 4x is 16 

428
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,490
and 4 times minus 3 is minus 12. 

429
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,610
And so we arrive at the new denominator 

430
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,310
4 times parenthesis to 4x minus 3. And I 

431
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,310
think we already know what we 

432
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,470
're going to do next. We 

433
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,190
only have 

434
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,550
multiplication in the numerator and 
denominator here , except for the 
brackets. 

435
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,510
We can therefore 

436
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,630
shorten the brackets . We now shorten the 

437
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,990
parentheses in the denominator with the 
power. And 

438
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,430
then we are left with 4x-3 divided by 4 

439
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,770
, which looks much simpler 

440
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,790
than the term here. And that's the end of 

441
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,770
the task and 

442
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,430
we'll now take a brief look at 

443
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,310
simplifying roots. The important thing to 

444
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,090
remember when simplifying roots 

445
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,250
is that if we take the square root, which 

446
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,370
is the normal root where there 

447
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,410
is nothing here , then whenever there 

448
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,670
is nothing here, it is the 

449
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,370
square root. If we 

450
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,750
raise it to the power of 2 or square it, 

451
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,970
the root is omitted . This means 

452
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,470
that in this case we have the root of 4 
plus the 

453
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,290
root of 3, the whole to the power of 2. 

454
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,950
So we see that we need the first 

455
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,190
binomial formula because we have 

456
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,680
an addition here. And root 4 is 

457
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,010
our a and root 3 is our b. The 

458
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,910
solution to the first binomial formula 

459
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,830
is a² plus 2ab equals b². 

460
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,060
In our case, we arrive at the 

461
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,180
root 4 to the power of 2. We then have two 

462
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,980
options. Either you 

463
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,260
solve the root straight away. You say that 
the 

464
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,880
root and the power of 2 cancel each other 
out. This is 

465
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,180
simply 4. Or you 

466
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,100
square the square root. So 

467
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,280
4 squares 16, which is what was 

468
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,900
done here. Then we continue with 2ab. 

469
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,920
So 2 times root 4 times root 3. 

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,300
plus b to the square 16. so root 3 

471
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,800
to the square in this case was also 
squared 

472
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,620
under the root so 3 

473
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,820
to the power of 2 so we get the root 

474
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,280
of 9 of course we simplify that 

475
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,980
now the root of 16 is 4 

476
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,400
and the root of 9 is 3 root 4 

477
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,980
times root 3 these are now root 

478
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,560
laws can be added together to 3 

479
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,300
times 4, 12, so the root of 12. 

480
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,140
This means that we can now simplify it 

481
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,680
to 4 plus 2 times the root of 

482
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,280
12 plus 3. Of course we could 

483
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,680
still do that , we could still 

484
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,020
add 4 plus 3 to get 7, but that's already 

485
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,540
simplified . That 

486
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,480
brings us to the end of the webinar. 

487
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,440
Thank you for your attention.
