00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,290
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,410
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
give you 

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,270
an insight into the topic of polar 

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,730
atomic bonding, electronegativity and 

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,250
dipole molecules. This video 

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,170
assumes that you are already 

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,190

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,650
familiar with the topic of electron pair 
bonds and the orbital model. Take a look 
at 

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,210
the videos in 

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,570
our online learning center. An 

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,650
atomic bond is an 

13
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,950
electron pair bond. This bond 

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,790
can be polar or non-polar, 

15
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,070
depending on the electronegativity 

16
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,230
of the atoms involved in the bond. 

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,590
Electronegativity, or EN for short, is 

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,650
the relative measure of the ability 

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,210
of an atom 

20
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,970
to attract electrons to itself. The higher 
the 

21
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,150
electronegativity, the stronger 

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,730
the respective atom attracts the 

23
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,690
electrons of the bond. The 

24
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,570
electronegativity of an element 

25
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,690

26
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,670
can be read off the PSE, i.e. the periodic 
table. Within 

27
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,470
the main groups of the PSE, the 

28
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,430
electronegativity increases from left to 

29
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,450
right from the first to the seventh 

30
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,650
main group. As 

31
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,750
the period increases , i.e. from top to 
bottom, 

32
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,750
the EN decreases. The electron density is 

33
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,210

34
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,550
higher on the thick side of the wedge. 

35
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,430
This is a so-called dipole molecule. The 

36
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,570
polarity of a molecule 

37
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,670
has a significant effect on its properties 

38
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,090
. For example, dissolved 

39
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,590
hydrogen chloride is an acid. When 

40
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,590
dissolved in water, it forms hydrochloric 
acid. 

41
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,130
Due to the high En difference, 

42
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,990
hydrogen chloride dissolved in water 

43
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,690
releases protons. 

44
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,110
Chloride anions are therefore also formed. 
Water itself is 

45
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,330
a polar solvent. 

46
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,190
Only polar or 

47
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,650
charged particles dissolve in it. In the 
H2O molecule 

48
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,850
, the electron density on the 

49
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,010
oxygen atom is significantly higher than 
on 

50
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,690
the hydrogen atoms. This 

51
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,830
results in a partially negative and 

52
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,330
a partially positive side. However, 

53
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,110
not every molecule with a polar 

54
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,590
atomic bond is a 

55
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,290
dipole molecule. The dipole character 

56
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,210
only comes into play if the 

57
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,030
electron density is asymmetrically 

58
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,630
redistributed. For example, the CO2 

59
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,830
 molecule is not a dipole because the 

60
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,090
oxygens, where the 

61
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,090
electron density 

62
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,530
is greater due to the higher En, are in 

63
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,530

64
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,250
line with the carbon atoms in the middle. 
The molecule does not have 

65
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,430
a more positive and a more negative 

66
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,210
side, so it is not a dipole molecule. 

67
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,430
For this reason, it is also important to 

68
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,810
draw the H2O molecule at an angle 

69
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,270
so that its dipole character can 

70
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,850
be recognized. Let's take a look 

71
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,550
at the compound ammonia 

72
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,670
with the molecular formula NH3 and 
boa-tri-fluoride 

73
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,170
with BF3. You can see from the 

74
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,650
structural formula that 

75
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,610
the three hydrogen atoms in ammonia 

76
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,550
are on one side, which 

77
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,510
is therefore partially positively charged, 

78
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,610
while the other side 

79
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,650

80
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,290
is partially negatively charged with the 
free electron pair of nitrogen . 

81
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,150
Ammonia is therefore a 

82
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,250
dipole molecule. The Bohr tri-fluoride 

83
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,850
molecule, on the other hand, is planar. 
All 

84
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,710
four atoms lie in one plane. The 

85
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,070
positive partial charge is centered on the 

86
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,170
Bohr atom, while the negative 

87
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,150
partial charges 

88
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,570
surround the central atom symmetrically. 

89
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,030
For these reasons, it is not a 

90
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,630
dipole molecule. The reason for the 

91
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,410
planar structure of the Bohr 

92
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,470
 tri-fluoride is the 

93
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,590
electron configuration of the Bohr. 

94
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,630
This has only three valence electrons 

95
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,510
, which 

96
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,010

97
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,950
form electron pair bonds with a maximum 
spacing angle of 120° . In ammonia, on the 
other hand, 

98
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,090
in addition to the 

99
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,170
three valence electrons that 

100
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,790

101
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,530
form the bond with the hydrogen atoms , 
the central nitrogen atom also has a free 

102
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,150
electron pair, which also 

103
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,210
requires space and the greatest possible 

104
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,110
distance to the 

105
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,470
electron pair bonds. 

106
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,150
A distinction is therefore made not only 
between 

107
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,790
polar and non-polar atomic bonds, 

108
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,730
but 

109
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,710
also between dipole 

110
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,130
and non-dipole molecules due to the 
structure of the compound. Dipoles 

111
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,090
are not to be confused with ions. 

112
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,450
In dipole molecules, the atoms are 

113
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,190
still linked via 

114
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,030
electron pair bonds. 

115
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,410
The partial charges result from 

116
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,730
the unequal distribution of the 

117
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,550
bonding electrons within the 

118
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,850
molecule. Nevertheless, a 

119
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,390
dipole molecule as a unit is 

120
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,090
electrically neutral to the outside. 

121
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,210
Thank you for your attention. I hope 

122
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,050
this video has helped you to understand 
the 

123
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,750
topic of polar atomic bonds 

124
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,890
. 

125
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,230
