00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,670
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,470
Schülerhilfe webinar. Today we're looking 
at 

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,390
text analysis and 

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,630
text interpretation. 

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,830
So let's take a look at what we 

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,890
need to know about text analysis. This 
means that 

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,730
we will first 

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,930

9
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,650
look at the general structure of a general 
analysis. Then we will 

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,810
make a brief digression into the genre of 
the text, 

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,810
because it is very important that we 

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,570

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,130
pay particular attention to the 

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,850
genre of the text when analyzing it. 

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,430
In other words, we will look at the three 
major 

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,650
fictional text genres 

17
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,770
and then 

18
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,710

19
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,810
move on to non-fictional texts. 

20
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,110
This is because each individual text 
genre, 

21
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,430
fictional or non-fictional, 

22
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,030
lyrical, dramatic or epic, has 

23
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,470
its own focal points of analysis and 

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,810
we want to 

25
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,250
shed light on these in this webinar. But 
first, a 

26
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,930
general outlook on the general 

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,610
analysis of a text. It is important to 
note 

28
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,350
that we generally 

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,130
divide an analysis into three parts. The 

30
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,670
introduction, the main body and the 

31
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,330
conclusion. The introduction 

32
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,470
, whose text production or during 

33
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,250
the entire text production is 

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,590
of course to be written in the present 
tense, 

35
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,310
gives the entire introduction or the 

36
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,790
entire beginning of the text production 

37
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,630
should introduce the topic and 

38
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,350

39
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,030
name the general information . Something 
like the literary 

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,070
genre, the title, the author, the 

41
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,090
time of origin, the first 

42
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,030
reading impression, which of course 

43
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,290
should not be based on how you yourself 

44
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,930
felt about reading, but on 

45
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,750
what kind of reading things 

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,050
immediately stuck in your 

47
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,090
mind. These are 

48
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,650
things like, for 

49
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,690
example , important people and 

50
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,910
important events in the named 

51
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,390
text. We should also 

52
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,210

53
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,190
name the basic features of the form, 
language and content. 

54
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,590
In other words, the introduction provides 
a 

55
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,670
general outlook and should 

56
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,410

57
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,070
inform the reader of our analysis to the 
extent that they know what the text 

58
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,210
is roughly about. 

59
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,810
Of course, the reader needs to know what 
text it is 

60
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,030
, i.e. what type of text, 

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,990
when, where and how. In other words, we 

62
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,790

63
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,310
may also need to make a few marginal notes 
about the time of origin 

64
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,510
if it 

65
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,630

66
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,230
was written about certain social or 
historical events 

67
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,290
or if they can be classified as such. 

68
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,970
Then we come to the 

69
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,730
main part. But first, 

70
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,850
of course, we need to be 

71
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,230
clear about the content. To do this, our 

72
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,730
analysis requires a 

73
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,390
summary of the content of the original 
text source. 

74
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,730
In other words, we prepare a 

75
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,790
summary of the content. This 

76
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,510
summary should 

77
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,550

78
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,610
inform the reader of our analysis about 
the content. 

79
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,270
Of course, we must 

80
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,370
formulate the summary in such a way that 

81
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,110
it is not a retelling 

82
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,070
, but that the most important and 

83
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,930
relevant points are named so that 

84
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,490
the reader 

85
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,510

86
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,450
can get an idea of what we are 

87
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,970
analyzing without having to read the 
entire original text . 

88
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,690

89
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,390
Once we have prepared the textual 
information or the table of contents, we 
will look 

90
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,110
at the form and 

91
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,870
structure of the text. The original text. 

92
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,830
Of course, we also look at 

93
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,630
the stylistic and linguistic 

94
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,170
features of the text. 

95
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,750
In other words, we start our analysis 

96
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,610
by 

97
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,370
looking at form and structure. In other 
words, we ask ourselves 

98
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,770
how we can 

99
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,430
divide up the text , how we can 

100
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,970
work it out, how we can 

101
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,150
understand it and what special features 

102
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,450
the text has. Of course, and 

103
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,030
we'll come to this later 

104
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,290
in the webinar , this 

105
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,030
differs from text card to text card. 
Whereas 

106
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,010
with a lyrical text we pay attention to 

107
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,270
the verses and stanzas into which 

108
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,530
it is divided, with prose 

109
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,770
 texts we  may have to 

110
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,650
divide it into sensory sections or, in the 
case of 

111
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,970
non-fiction texts 

112
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,050
, divide it into certain sensory sections, 
because 

113
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,290
different topics are 

114
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,870
named. This means 

115
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,150
, of course, that we have to pay attention 
to which 

116
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,850
text and which type of text we are 

117
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,770
dealing with here. 

118
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,470
However, this is basically the first task 
of 

119
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,090
our text analysis, i.e. the 

120
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,030
actual analysis, the main part. 

121
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,590
We must then 

122
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,930
move on to the interpretation. In doing 
so, we must 

123
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,170

124
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,950
allow conclusions to be drawn from the 
text description. This means 

125
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,510
that we have only 

126
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,330
named the content, form and structure and 
must 

127
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,970
now place these in context. 

128
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,230
In other words, we must first 

129
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,190
reproduce the text. Basically, this means 

130
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,230
filtering what is important and 

131
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,290

132
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,230
developing something from what has been 
filtered. In other words, we 

133
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,210
can 

134
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,830
draw thoughts and conclusions that will 

135
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,410
ultimately lead us to our 

136
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,770
interpretation. 

137
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,410
Of course, we provide this evidence 

138
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,850
through quotations. In other words, 

139
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,030
we prove our conclusions by 

140
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,710
referring to the text. 

141
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,910
After we have done this extensively 

142
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,590
and thoroughly, we come 

143
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,770
to a conclusion. In other words 

144
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,610
, at the beginning of our analysis we may 

145
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,690
already formulate an interpretative 
hypothesis, 

146
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,410
i.e. a general core idea for which 

147
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,330
we want to examine the text, 

148
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,190
with the help of the conclusion 

149
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,950
of the quotations and the general 

150
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,330
content and structure of the text 

151
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,690
. In other words, we 

152
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,630
make a critical assessment of the text 

153
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,470
by 

154
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,710
either 

155
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,670
verifying or falsifying our interpretative 
hypothesis . 

156
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,590
In other words, we have substantiated it 
and 

157
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,210
establish that it 

158
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,870
is either correct or incorrect. The 

159
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,990
train of thought that we 

160
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,530
had at the beginning , that's usually the 
first 

161
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,770
impression that basically enables us 

162
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,450
to verify 

163
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,030
and 

164
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,410
think about the general idea . After we 

165
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,570
have done that , sometimes there is the 
task 

166
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,390
or we also have the opportunity to 

167
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,730

168
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,770
express our own experience or opinion, the 
subjective opinion. We 

169
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,470
should always be aware 

170
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,790
that during an analysis we 

171
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,770

172
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,210
should work as objectively analytically as 
possible. This means 

173
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,270
that our own opinion, i.e. the 

174
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,090
general emotional opinion, should 

175
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,990
be held back and should only 

176
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,950

177
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,770
come into play during or after the actual 
closing argument. 

178
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,190
Now let's take a brief excursion 

179
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,210
into text genres. Text genres 

180
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,290
are primarily divided, or 

181
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,270
texts are primarily divided, into 

182
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,150
two major divisions. We 

183
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,610
have already mentioned this at the 
beginning. 

184
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,990
Fictional texts, i.e. imaginary 

185
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,790
texts, and non-fictional texts, i.e. 

186
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,650
real texts. Real 

187
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,410
texts are something like non-fictional 
texts, 

188
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,250
everyday texts, which can 

189
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,970
be political speeches, scientific 

190
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,890
essays or journalistic texts, 

191
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,590
newspaper reports and others. 

192
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,150
Fictional texts are literary, 

193
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,650
i.e. imaginary texts. 

194
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,490
It is important to note that Berlin 

195
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,210
can also be portrayed fictionally 

196
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,290
. The difference is that 

197
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,830
a fictional Berlin 

198
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,470
can also have other characteristics. This 
means that 

199
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,870
in a fictional 

200
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,130
Berlin , we can also paint the city larger 

201
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,970
than it is, smaller than it 

202
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,270
is. We can 

203
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,750
feel other people in it, while a 

204
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,830
non-fictional Berlin is the concrete, 

205
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,850
real Berlin. This means that the 

206
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,570
non-fictional must inevitably 

207
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,270

208
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,090
be bound to reality and truth. Fictional 
texts 

209
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,350
are allowed to modify this a little, 

210
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,610
i.e. 

211
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,070
to deviate from actual reality in order to 

212
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,530
better 

213
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,950
represent an idea or their own idea. We 
divide 

214
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,410
fictional texts into the three major 

215
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,650
text genres: epic, poetry 

216
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,770
and drama. 

217
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,930
For example, poetry and drama 

218
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,490
apart from drama, i.e. epic and 

219
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,210
poetry apart from drama 

220
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,450
, differ from each other in that their 

221
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,330
text form is different. While 

222
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,250
epic poetry is written in prose, i.e. in 
continuous text 

223
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,130
, lyric poetry is 

224
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,090
written in verse and stanzas, i.e. in a 

225
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,170
generally composed text form. In 

226
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,170
epic poetry, it is not important or 

227
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,890
less interesting how the 

228
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,990
words themselves 

229
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,890
are structurally linked, which 

230
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,350
is a 

231
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,390
key feature of lyric poetry . This means 
that here, too, 

232
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,870
we quickly realize how important 

233
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,610
it is to 

234
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,110
know the different text genres and to 

235
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,490
be aware of 

236
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,670
the type of text 

237
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,030
we are analysing before we begin. 

238
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,370
This contrasts with drama. 

239
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,470
Drama is the general form of 

240
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,170
plays. In other words, in addition to 

241
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,510
poetry and epic poetry, which 

242
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,070
can have their presentation , i.e. poetry 
has 

243
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,150
an external presentation, which means it 

244
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,070
can be read aloud, it is 

245
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,490
intended for an audience, 

246
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,010
an audience of course , while epic poetry 

247
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,030

248
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,590
establishes a more private, intimate 
relationship with the reader, drama 

249
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,390

250
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,930
is intended for the theater, i.e. for 
theatrical presentation. Drama 

251
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,730
is something like a comedy, a 

252
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,570
tragedy, a popular play, a 

253
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,470
stage play. Something that basically 

254
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,090

255
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,990
has certain characteristics such as 
dialog, character speech and characters, 

256
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,930
which we 

257
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,770
find less of in poetry, for example. This 
is because in lyric poetry 

258
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,710
, the speech is usually 

259
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,070

260
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,570
produced from a lyrical first person, 
whereas in epic poetry 

261
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,950
, other characters 

262
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,190
are portrayed differently . 

263
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,870
A distinction is made between the 
first-person 

264
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,250
 narrator and the authorial 

265
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,330
narrator or personal narrator. 

266
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,610
But more on this later. We want to 

267
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,010
look at the short examples of genres 

268
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,350
, poetry, as already mentioned, almost 
something 

269
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,330
like the ballad, the ode, the sonnet 

270
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,530
or the poem, while epic poetry, 

271
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,730
novels, novellas, chronicles, it 

272
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,390
can also be biographies, 

273
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,090
short stories, fairy tales or 

274
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,470
basically simple stories 

275
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,030
or fables. Let's now move on to the 

276
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,950
actual analysis, i.e. the 

277
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,670
focus of our webinar, and 

278
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,870
concentrate 

279
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,050
on narrative texts, i.e. the first 

280
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,810
text card, epic poetry. In the case of 
epic poetry 

281
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,370
, the 

282
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,090
author is not the same as the narrator. 

283
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,250
In other words, we must not assume 

284
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,510
that the author is the one 

285
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,910
telling the story. We have to 

286
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,950
pay attention to 

287
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,190

288
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,750
the narrative perspective, as I have just 
mentioned . 

289
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,450
In other words, one of our 

290
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,490
main points of analysis is to 

291
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,170
recognize from which perspective 

292
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,130
the story is told and to ask ourselves 

293
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,230
why. That would then be a 

294
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,650
point for interpretation. So first 

295
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,130
we have to make the observation, 

296
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,950
that would be the first part of our 

297
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,810
main part and the second part would be 

298
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,650
the question of why. So we have to 

299
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,170
draw a conclusion from this. 

300
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,330
We differentiate between the 

301
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,570
first-person narrator and the third-person 

302
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,110
 narrator. This can be a first-person 

303
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,670
narrator or a third-person narrator. The 

304
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,410
narrative perspective as an adjective, 
i.e. 

305
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,490
attribute,  can 

306
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,390
be either authorial, i.e. 

307
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,590
omniscient, personal, i.e. 

308
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,750
focused on one person, or 

309
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,250
neutral, i.e. a 

310
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,930
silent observer. With the 

311
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,510
personal or authorial 

312
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,630
narrative perspective, we 

313
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,490
also have many impressions, i.e. 

314
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,570
subjective impressions, whereas 

315
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,710
with the neutral narrative perspective, 

316
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,350
we are basically only observing, 

317
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,070
i.e. watching. 

318
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,330
We don't have the chance to 

319
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,330

320
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,290
read the individual emotions or thoughts 
of the individual characters. It is then 

321
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,230
important to recognize the characters' 
speech in the 

322
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,870
general prose. In 

323
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,110
other words, is it 

324
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,210
dialog? Is there indirect speech, 

325
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,810
inner monologue? What is the 

326
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,730
general direct speech like ? In other 
words, 

327
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,410
how do the characters speak to and 

328
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,370
among themselves? We also need to 

329
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,390

330
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,010
talk about the general time. In other 
words, how is the 

331
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,850
story told, the narrative time and the 

332
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,930
narrated time. Here it is important 

333
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,130
that we 

334
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,410
pay attention to whether the narrative 
time is 

335
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,930
tightening, stretching or 

336
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,070
covering time. And when it comes to 

337
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,890
narrated time, we have to 

338
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,090
ask ourselves to what extent we learn 

339
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,090
how much about time. In other words, do 

340
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,550
we experience narratives about a 

341
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,510
day, a year, a week, 

342
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,890
a whole life or a 

343
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,350
whole family history. 

344
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,370
Time-lapse is something that 

345
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,130
shortens time itself, for example. 

346
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,190
This means that what we read can 

347
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,470
be completed in three days, for example, 

348
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,210
although we naturally 

349
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,850
read from second to second. In other 
words, time 

350
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,090
is power. In the case of time dilation 

351
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,050
, a moment is savored. 

352
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,690
In other words, we move in 

353
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,450
a moment for longer than we 

354
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,830
can experience it in reality. Or in the 
case of 

355
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,050
time coverage, a 

356
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,770
narrative 

357
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,870
takes place at the same time as the 
reading. This means that the 

358
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,710
events happen as we 

359
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,050
read them. In other words, they 

360
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,290
correspond to real time. In addition, 

361
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,430
we also have to deal with 

362
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,630
space, i.e. the general 

363
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,690
location of the plot. 

364
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,260
When analyzing lyrical texts, i.e. 

365
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,320
poetry, it is important, 

366
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,660
as we have already mentioned, 

367
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,380
not to 

368
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,940
see the lyrical ego as the author. So 
basically, with 

369
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,240
texts, we don't treat the author 

370
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,060
as the narrator or the lyrical 

371
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,240
ego, which 

372
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,580
is ultimately also a narrator. Lyrical 

373
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,920
texts usually deal with emotional 

374
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,780
themes or major topics that 

375
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,960
are difficult to put into words. This is 
why 

376
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,000
the lyrical text form is chosen as 

377
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,420
basically artificial material, 

378
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,220
as art attempts to 

379
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,120
describe what is difficult to put into 
words 

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
. This means that we have 

381
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,480
certain characteristics typical of the 
genre 

382
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,980
, such as rhythmic 

383
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,420
composition. In other words 

384
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,580
, we are not talking about lines and words 
here, 

385
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,100
but words, 

386
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,200
verses and stanzas. They have a 

387
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,360
certain rhythm, they have rhymes, 

388
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,580
the tonal design. 

389
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,440
We are also talking about cadences, i.e. 

390
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
rises and falls, about a 

391
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,760
certain rhythm in the performance. It 

392
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,020
is the valley of death that we 

393
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,040
tread. In other words, it already has 

394
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,860
a great performance, which 

395
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,420
ultimately puts us in the right 

396
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,300
mood. 

397
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,200
Of course, it is important that this 
language is 

398
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,360
based on images. 

399
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,880
In other words , because the words 

400
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,040
are condensed and deliberately chosen, 

401
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,000
they are naturally based on the fact that 
they 

402
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,560

403
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,760

404
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,140
create large and powerful images in a 
nutshell, i.e. with short and few words . 
That's why 

405
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,480
rhetorical and linguistic means are 

406
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,980
necessary, so that things like 

407
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,300
metaphor comparisons, 

408
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,700
allusions or other 

409
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,060
things that ultimately 

410
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,600
give us stylistic figures that we 

411
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,880
use to 

412
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,840
create or project images in our heads, 

413
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,900
that is, to 

414
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,140
create images in our minds. When analyzing 

415
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,000
dramatic texts, it's 

416
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,040
something else again , which is why this 

417
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,000
form stands somewhat apart, because text 

418
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,020
and performance must be in a 

419
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,680
relationship to each other. Our 

420
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,640
thinking is natural, our 

421
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,060
train of thought is natural, are 

422
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,360
the two coherent 

423
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,920
, so what we read is also... 

424
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,600
performable. 

425
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,940
Of course , we always have to keep in mind 

426
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,860
while reading a drama that 

427
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,420
we actually 

428
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,380
have to imagine it on stage. This means 

429
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,140
that the structure of the text is far 

430
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,980
different from that of prose or 

431
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,200
poetry, because the general action 

432
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,820
takes place in acts. These acts 

433
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,180
are divided into scenes and these 

434
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,300
scenes are in turn 

435
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,220
subordinated to a certain scheme. 

436
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,040
We are talking about the prologue 

437
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,480
, i.e. the introduction, the dialog, the 

438
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,240
various 

439
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,160
plot propellants, which are called 

440
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,060
recitative in music. 

441
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,460
The plot is driven forward 

442
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,620
by two people talking about 

443
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,860
what is happening and what 

444
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,620
will happen. And this is what 

445
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,560
drives the plot forward. And the 

446
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,780
monologue 

447
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,320

448
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,680
reflects on the action, i.e. the events 
and happenings . Through the monologue, we 
receive 

449
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,220
the actual personal 

450
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,280
and intimate thoughts on the 

451
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,640
events happening in the dialog. In 
addition, 

452
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,360
we have stage directions that 

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680

454
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,320
basically want to tell the actor and us as 
readers how we 

455
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,560

456
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,660
should experience and 

457
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,160
imagine the spoken dialog and the 
individual characters. The 

458
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,600
stage design, i.e. the backdrops 

459
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,400
, the way they speak and the 

460
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,300
gestures, whether they speak loudly, 
whether they 

461
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,580
sound whiny, whether they fall, whether 

462
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,760
they stutter, these are things that 

463
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,680
are given via the stage directions. 

464
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,120
The scenic presentation, such as the 

465
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,320
stage design, i.e. the scenery, and 

466
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,100
of course the voice, stage, 

467
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,980
lighting and clothing are important, which 

468
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,840
we 

469
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,940
have to imagine in our heads when we read 
a drama . The 

470
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,660
production is the same as the 

471
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,500
director, that is, the director, 

472
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,340
before he brings a play to the stage 

473
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,840
, does exactly what 

474
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,600
we 

475
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,620
want to do in our analysis , because he 
imagines the 

476
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,740
play in his head and 

477
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,240
analyzes the individual points and 

478
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
basically finds 

479
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,040
his interpretation, what our 

480
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,620
analysis also wants and basically wants to 

481
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,020

482
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,820
share it with an audience . When analyzing 

483
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,840
non-fiction texts, and now we are moving 

484
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,800
away from fictional texts, because 

485
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,860
now we are coming to 

486
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,560
non-fictional texts, it is important 

487
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,060
that we 

488
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,780
filter out a main message . What does the 

489
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,520
text want to tell us ? We have to 

490
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280

491
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,740
find out and understand the main points 
and the topic and we 

492
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,920
have to 

493
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,040

494
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,480

495
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,460
examine these main statements and the main 
points for theses, facts, examples, 
questions and check them. 

496
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,860
Are they comprehensible 

497
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,880
or not? We then have to 

498
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,320
ask ourselves: what is the 

499
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
intention of this text? Is it 

500
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,420
appealing to us, i.e. inviting 

501
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,580
us to reflect, or is it 

502
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,940
a criticism? 

503
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,740
So what does this text want from us? What 
is 

504
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,280
its intended message? 

505
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,260
We also look at the 

506
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,400
structure of the argument, because 

507
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
factual texts, such as a 

508
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,280
political speech, are usually structured 
in 

509
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,540
arguments. Arguments. 

510
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,200
These arguments are made up 

511
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,340
of a thesis, examples, 

512
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,260
facts and questions. So 

513
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,740
basically, we can 

514
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,740
define this point here as an argument. 

515
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,460
So we always have a thesis, 

516
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,740
an assumption and an example here , which 

517
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,140
basically motivates us to 

518
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,600
make an argument and these 

519
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
arguments are lined up. And 

520
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
there are different models. 

521
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,540
We have to examine 

522
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,580
and recognize these models. Are arguments 

523
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,180
and counter-arguments being made here ? 

524
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,000
Are only pro-arguments presented or only 

525
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,160
counter-arguments? How are 

526
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,300
the individual arguments weighted? 

527
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,940
Are they emotional or 

528
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,540
factual? What are the 

529
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,320
individual arguments based on ? Are they 

530
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,600
expert opinions? Are they normative, 

531
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,640
i.e. universally valid arguments or 

532
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,100
subjective perceived experiences? 

533
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,440
are of course also 

534
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,960

535
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440

536
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,940
delivered using rhetorical means and the 
resulting persuasive power. We have to 
recognize these 

537
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,480
and ask ourselves to what extent they 

538
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240

539
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,140
are authentic, i.e. comprehensible . And, 
of course, we have to 

540
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,720

541
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,320

542
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,440

543
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,780

544
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,410
deal with the choice of words and the 
jargon , i.e. the general language, the 
political speech, for example, or the 
general factual text. So we have 

545
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,010
learned that 

546
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,370
different points are important when 
analyzing 

547
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,210
, which basically depends on 

548
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,310
the type of text. 

549
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,070
However, we have found that 

550
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,990
general analysis is based on 

551
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,530
having an introduction, 

552
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,650
i.e. visualizing what 

553
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,210
it is about, what 

554
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,150
type of text it is , who wrote it, 

555
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,530
what the title is and by 

556
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,990
describing what 

557
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,410
it is about in a short sentence , then 

558
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,370
presenting the content , i.e. we produce 

559
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,710
a summary by 

560
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,450
reproducing the content for a possible 
reader of . a 

561
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,470
possible reader of our analysis, 

562
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,750
who basically 

563
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,790

564
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,410
has to be prepared first with the help of 
our analysis. These are then the points 

565
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,850
of the introduction, the 

566
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,590
framework conditions, the general 

567
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,830
content and then we 

568
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,050
come to our structural analysis, in 

569
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,470
which we look at how the text is 

570
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,270
structured, how it is structured, what 

571
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,410
the appearance is like. 

572
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,430
We then draw conclusions and 

573
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,710
interpret 

574
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,650

575
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,050
our own ideas 

576
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,110
or thoughts from the things we have just 
reproduced, such as content and structure 
, and 

577
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,510
basically take the 

578
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,250
given information and develop it into a 
possible 

579
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,090
interpretative hypothesis, which we 

580
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,470

581
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,630
put together at the end of our analysis, 
i.e. the thoughts that we bring together 
by 

582
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,290
looking at point A and point B and 

583
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,770
bringing them together and 

584
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,490
drawing a conclusion for ourselves. For 

585
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,370
example, I go outside, it's cold, 

586
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,530
I conclude that it's winter. 

587
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,110
So that's what I mean by 

588
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,990
conclusion. And then 

589
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,790
we come to a 

590
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,590
conclusion for ourselves , in which we 

591
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,230
are of course not subjective 

592
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,170
, but we try to 

593
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,450

594
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,530
come to a conclusion with the help of our 
analysis and our analysis results 

595
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,370
and to see a summary 

596
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,130
by always asking ourselves the question 

597
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,050
, why 

598
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,990
was this written ? Why did this intention 

599
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,030
come into my head? And how did 

600
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,030
I come to 

601
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,590
do something with it? Then, if 

602
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,270
we wish, we can also write 

603
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,210
our own opinion, i.e. how we 

604
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,210
felt about the text and 

605
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,310
how we feel about it. That is 

606
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,090

607
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,030
to say about the general analysis and 
interpretation of texts. 

608
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,430
Thank you very much.
