00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,490
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,950
Curve Discussion. In this webinar 

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,410
we will 

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,050

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,350
talk about the most prominent points of a 
curve discussion and also look at 

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,890
what we need them for. In a 

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,470
curve discussion, you always calculate 

8
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,770
salient points. These salient 

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,790
points characterize a graph 

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,650
very strongly. This means that if you 

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,970
know these points, you can 

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,050

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,790
make a very precise sketch of this graph. 
We will 

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,230
now also 

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,850

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,210
set up the webinar using an example 
function equation and we will use this to 

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,670
discuss the curves 

18
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,650
and at the end we will look at the 

19
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,650
calculated points on the graph 

20
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,610
and then you will see that these 

21
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,550
points already 

22
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,010
describe the course of the graph very 
well. Of course, 

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,770
you could also do the whole thing with a 

24
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,290
table of values. 

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,850
However, a table of values has the problem 

26
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,990
that there is always a certain distance 

27
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,290
between the points and this leads 

28
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,030
to inaccuracies, because the 

29
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,890
prominent points of a graph, such as 

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,190
extreme points or inflection points, 

31
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,750
unfortunately do not always have to lie on 
the 

32
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,470
step size of the table of values 

33
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,510
and can therefore often only 

34
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,910
be displayed or 

35
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,130
determined inadequately . Therefore, the 

36
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,570
calculation is firstly mathematically 

37
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,110
more beautiful and secondly much 

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,610
more accurate. Here are the 

39
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,590
three most common points that come to mind 
when you 

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,550
hear the word 

41
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,870
curve discussion. 

42
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,630
First of all, there is the zero. 

43
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,330
The zero point is nothing more than a 

44
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,710
point of intersection with the x-axis. 

45
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,910
We'll take a closer look at this in a 
moment 

46
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,650
. An inflection point. And 

47
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,930
inflection points are points at which 

48
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,730
the curvature behavior changes. 

49
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,230
In other words, it changes from 

50
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,770
curved to the left to curved to the right 
or 

51
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,270
vice versa. Extreme points are the 

52
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,570
latter. I think that's what 

53
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,310
you think of first. These 

54
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,950
are high or low points. And they 

55
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,250
are simply points where the 

56
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,010
gradient is zero. 

57
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,270

58
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,610
We'll 

59
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,150
see why this is the case and where this 
concept of zero gradient comes from when 
we 

60
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,050
calculate the turning points. First of 
all, 

61
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,210
we now see the 

62
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,150
equation of the function, which we 

63
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,610
will always use in the following. f 

64
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,890
of x is equal to 1 half x to the power of 
3 

65
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,010
minus 1 half x² minus 3x. 

66
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,250
As I said, we will use this to 

67
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,770
carry out the curve discussion in the 
following and this 

68
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,190
is also our task for 

69
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,510
this webinar. 

70
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,610
As part of the curve discussion, we will 
also briefly 

71
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,550
discuss tools of the trade, how to 

72
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,410
solve certain equations or what to 

73
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,350
look out for. So we won 

74
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,290
't always 

75
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,250
solve the equations completely. We will, 
as you will 

76
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,090
see in a moment, write down the approach 

77
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,590
and the result. But then 

78
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,810
we will also write or provide 

79
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,670
information on the best way 

80
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,800
to solve it. First of all, before you 

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,240
start discussing the curves 

82
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,300
, the domain of definition should be 
clarified 

83
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,520
. In many tasks, 

84
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,060
this is already given, in which case 

85
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,680
you can of course save yourself this step. 

86
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,940
However, it should always be 

87
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,160
taken into account. So you always have to 

88
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,820
consider whether the definition range 

89
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,740
is restricted or from where to where 

90
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,480
it goes. Basically, however, 

91
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,020
the first thing to say is that for 
completely rational 

92
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,980
functions, the domain of definition is 

93
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,780
not restricted and the function 

94
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,000
is 

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,760
defined for all real numbers. That's what 
we see here and that 

96
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
's usually the information 

97
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,060
you get in the problem text. If 

98
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,920
not, however, this should be 

99
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,780
stated first. Caution is advised if 

100
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,640
it 

101
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,060
is not a completely normal, completely 
rational function, for example if the 

102
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,540
function contains fractions, i.e. it is a 

103
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,160
fraction function, a 

104
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,020
fractional rational 

105
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,660
function equation, then you have to 

106
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,020
be careful because the denominator must 

107
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,220
never become zero. With 

108
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,080
root functions you have to be 

109
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,360
careful, 

110
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,020
there must never be anything negative 
under the root . The important thing is 
that 

111
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300

112
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,200
there can still be a 0 under the root , 
which is still OK. This is 

113
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,240
the big difference to the 

114
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
logarithm. The logarithm may 

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,640
only contain values greater than 0. 

116
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,360
The 0 is no longer OK there. 

117
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,460
This means that the logarithm can only 
contain values 

118
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,500
greater than 0, roots can only contain 
values greater than or equal to 

119
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,020
0. This is very important, these are the 

120
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,000
three most common things that are then 

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
dealt with and the 

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,200

123
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,620
corresponding definition range is then 
calculated using this information. 

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
Right, let's start by 

125
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,380
calculating the zeros. As we said earlier 

126
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,540
, the zeros 

127
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,700
of a function equation are the 

128
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,740
points of intersection with the x-axis. 

129
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,780
These are the 

130
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,080
points marked here with green crosses and 
if you 

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
take a closer look at these points, you 
will 

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,200
immediately see that they all have 

133
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,680
the function value 

134
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,700
or y-coordinate 0 in common. 

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,920
This is why the condition 

136
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,100
for a zero point f of x is 0. 

137
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,200
We therefore set our 

138
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,320
function equation f of x equal to 0 

139
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,360
and then have to solve the equation 

140
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,180
. This is how you calculate zeros. 

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,920

142
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,200

143
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
In our case, we have a 

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,900
third-degree function , the degree of a 

145
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
function is always determined by 

146
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,780
the largest exponent, which in 

147
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,740
our case is 3, so this is a 

148
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,640
third-degree function and to 

149
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
determine the zero, we set 

150
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,040
this function equation, yes, as 

151
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,200
just said, equal to 0, 

152
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,960
which means we get this equation 1 

153
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,100
.5x to the power of 3 minus 1.5x² minus 3x 
is 

154
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,360
equal to 0, which is simply an 

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,340
equation with the largest power to the 
power of 

156
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,400
3. And we realize that all the 

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,640
elements in here have an x. This means 
that our exponent is equal to 0 . This 

158
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,180
means that our smallest exponent is x 

159
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,080
to the power of 1. And we can always 

160
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,940
factor out the smallest exponent. So 

161
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,000
we can factor out the x. And to 

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,980
make the whole thing a little nicer 

163
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,720
, we can also 

164
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,980

165
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,180
factor out the 1.5 , because we have the 
1.5 in here twice. 

166
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,740
To do this, we now have to 

167
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,060
divide everything by 1 .5x. 1.5x to the 
power of 3 divided by 

168
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,520
1.5x is x². Minus 1.5x² 

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,640
divided by 1.5x is minus x. And now, 

170
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,140
very importantly, minus 3x divided by 

171
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,100
1.5x is 

172
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,840
minus 6.3 divided by 1.5, i.e. 3 

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,480
divided by 0.5 is 

174
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,360
6 . 

175
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,080
And so we 

176
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,180
now have a product. The advantage of 

177
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,840
this product is that we can apply the 

178
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,240
so-called zero product theorem 

179
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,860
. The zero product theorem 

180
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,240
says that if one of these two terms 

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,840
becomes 0, the 

182
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,540
product is also automatically 0. 
Therefore, we have 

183
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,320
the possibility that 1 half x 

184
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,000
becomes 0 , i.e. x1 is 0, or we 

185
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,860
have the possibility that x²-x-6 

186
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,040
is 0. And that is also 

187
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
the next step. So 

188
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,460
if you 

189
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,400
have written it down like this, you can 
directly conclude that the 

190
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,160
first solution x1 is 0 or x²-x-6 is 

191
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,260
0. And this then results in 

192
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,000
a corresponding equation. 

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,900
But this is now just a 

194
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,360
quadratic equation and that's 

195
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,620
the trick. At the 

196
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,580
beginning we had a cubic equation, now we 

197
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,080
only have a quadratic equation . And 

198
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,640
we can 

199
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,500

200
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,640
solve this quadratic equation with the 
midnight formula or with the pq formula. 

201
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,260
We would have 

202
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,980
just 

203
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,640
had to solve the third-degree functional 
equation with the polinomial division and 
that is much 

204
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,200
more complicated than this quadratic 

205
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,680
equation that we now have to solve, which 

206
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,020
is also 

207
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,460
worth mentioning. the degree of an 

208
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,160
equation also indicates the 

209
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,080
maximum number of solutions, which 

210
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
means we have a 

211
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,740
third-degree functional equation here. 

212
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,960
This can therefore 

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,060
produce a maximum of three solutions. 

214
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,540
The maximum 

215
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,960
number is always important. A third-degree 

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,480
or second-degree function can also 

217
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,570
have no solution. Now let's 

218
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,970
take a brief look at the multiplicity 

219
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,290
of zeros. It may 

220
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,290
well be the case, for 

221
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,470
example if 

222
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,090
x² rather than x is excluded here , that a 

223
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,310
zero occurs several times. For 

224
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,750
example, if we now had x² 

225
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,910
, we would have the zero twice. And 

226
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,470
these digits are then 

227
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,250

228
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,910
called a double zero if it occurs twice, 
or a 

229
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,870

230
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,230
triple zero if it occurs three times. If 
it only 

231
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,590
occurs once, it is also called 

232
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,750
a single zero. 

233
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,970
From a graphical point of view, however, 
this cannot be 

234
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,690
interpreted any further. 

235
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,470
Next, we have 

236
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,570

237
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,570
written down our function equation again. 
A slide like this 

238
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,950
will appear more often in the following. 
We 

239
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,010
always write 

240
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,730
down our results here. 

241
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,910
For example, these are the zeros 

242
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,850
that we have just calculated. 

243
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,530
Of course, we have only 

244
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,530
calculated the xth , because the function 
value at 

245
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,710
the zero is always 0. That 

246
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,870
is also the necessary condition 

247
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,790
for this. And these are the three 

248
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,750
zeros. In the following, 

249
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,450
extreme points, inflection points and 

250
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,290
many other significant points 

251
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,230
will be added. Let's move on to the next 

252
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,890
intersection point. There are always 

253
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,590
two points of intersection with the 

254
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,210
axis cross. These are the points of 

255
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,930
intersection with the x-axis and 

256
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,670
the points of intersection with the y-axis 

257
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,470
.  The points of intersection with the 

258
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,670
 x-axis are the zero points, which 

259
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,390
we have just calculated. And 

260
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,550
now we also calculate, this 

261
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,010
is not always necessary, but 

262
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,150
often required, as I said, 

263
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,010
this is always required, if the 

264
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,910
points of intersection with the axis cross 

265
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,210
are required, then 

266
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,150
both are always required and therefore 

267
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,610
we now also calculate the points of 
intersection with 

268
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,230
the y-axis. This intersection point 

269
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,830
is also called the Y-axis intercept. The 

270
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,750
good news here is that it 

271
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,270
is not too difficult to calculate, 

272
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,030
because to 

273
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,990
calculate the y-axis intercept , we simply 
calculate f 

274
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,330
from 0. So we 

275
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,650
insert 0 into the function equation and 

276
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,570
see what comes out. 

277
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,110
A small simplification is that 

278
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,650
you always have to 

279
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,350
look at the absolute value. Everything 
that has an x 

280
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,270
becomes 0 and only the 

281
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,990
absolute term remains. In this case, 

282
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,690
we don't have one, so it is a 0 

283
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,210
and so the y 

284
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,150
-axis intercept is also  0 or the point 

285
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,570
P00. 

286
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,010
We will now 

287
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,910
add this to our results and 

288
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,930
this slide will 

289
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,700
continue to fill up over the course of the 
webinar. 

290
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,060
Symmetry is actually very important 

291
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,320
for a graph, because you can use 

292
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
symmetry 

293
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,580
to compare your results and check their 

294
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,980
plausibility, and if you 

295
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,400
want to draw it at the end, you need to 

296
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,720
know it. There are also only two 

297
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,940
simple types of symmetry, i.e. 

298
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,520
two types that are covered 

299
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
at school. One is 

300
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,140
axis symmetry and the other is 

301
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,060
point symmetry. There is a 

302
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,460
third possibility, which is that there is 
no 

303
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,680
symmetry at all. And now we 

304
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,160
just have to see which of these three 

305
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,080
cases we have. We also 

306
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,300
always have the conditions here. 

307
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,260
The condition for axis symmetry 

308
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,300
is f minus x equals f minus x. 

309
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,400
This means that we 

310
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,820

311
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,940
get the 

312
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,400
same result regardless of whether we enter 
our variable as positive or negative. This 
is 

313
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,840
axis symmetry. The point symmetry 

314
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,860
is f of minus x is equal to minus 

315
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,280
f of x. This means that if we enter our 

316
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,980
x in pre-symmetric form 

317
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,820
, we also get the function value 

318
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,300
in pre-symmetric form. 

319
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,140

320
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,980
You can easily 

321
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,440
tell which of these two cases you have by 
looking at the exponents 

322
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,460
: axis symmetry only has 

323
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,480
even exponents and 

324
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,860
point symmetry only has odd 

325
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,280
exponents What is very important is that 

326
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
axis symmetry can also 

327
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,440
have an absolute term, which 

328
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,380
point symmetry cannot have 

329
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,700
This means that by looking at the 

330
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,100
exponents, you can very 

331
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,860
quickly decide which 

332
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,940
symmetry to check for . 

333
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,440
Of course, you only have to check the 
symmetry 

334
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,460
until you have found out 

335
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,660
whether there is axisymmetry, 

336
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,740
point symmetry or perhaps 

337
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,500
no symmetry at all . In other words 

338
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,180
, if you see that the function is 

339
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,740
axisymmetric, for example, 

340
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,740
it is not axisymmetric 

341
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,360
, but if you have a function... 

342
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,580
action carrier where you think 

343
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,600
it is axisymmetric, then 

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,740
the first thing you do is check for 

345
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,580
axisymmetry and usually 

346
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,540
your first impression 

347
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,520
is not wrong and you only have to 

348
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
do one calculation and not 

349
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,220
two. Well, let's just start 

350
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,860
with our calculations. Let's see 

351
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,940
, we form f from minus 

352
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,540
x here. This means that we 

353
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,860
insert a minus x everywhere for x and 

354
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,140
it is very important that we always 

355
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,520
pay attention to the exponents. If the 

356
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,780
exponent is odd, like 3, 

357
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,980
the sign remains the same. If 

358
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,960
the exponent is even, like 2, 

359
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,280
the sign is removed. So 

360
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,400
minus x to the power of 3 or 1 half times 
minus 

361
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
x to the power of 3 becomes minus 1 half 
times x to the power of 3. 

362
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,280
So the minus was 

363
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,440
drawn directly in front of the 1 half, but 
remains there. 

364
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,960
The minus 1 half times minus x square 

365
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
also becomes minus 1 half times x square. 
So 

366
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,940
here you can see that if the minus had 

367
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,020
remained, we would have 

368
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,120
had minus minus. But it is to the power of 

369
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,560
2, so the minus is omitted and the 

370
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,080
minus is also retained here. and 

371
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,760
minus 3 times minus x is plus 3x, you 

372
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
can imagine that 

373
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
if you don't have an exponent that 

374
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,320
it is a 1, then it would also be an 

375
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,660
odd exponent and the sign 

376
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,760
would be retained. And 

377
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,320
now we look to see if we can somehow 

378
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,700

379
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,280
find our functional equation f of x again. 

380
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,520
The first thing we're going to do now is 
to look at f 

381
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,720
of x , we had a 1.5 here , so 

382
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,420
we'll first try to 

383
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,740
bracket it so that we get this 1.5... 

384
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,380
x to the power of 3, then we have to 

385
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,860
factor out the minus and then, if 

386
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,220
we factor out the minus, 

387
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,100
the minus 1.5 becomes a plus 1.5 of course 

388
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,840
and the plus 3x becomes a minus 

389
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,180
3x. And now we have to see whether 

390
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,200
this 

391
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,460

392
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,180
corresponds to our functional equation f 
of x. This is not the case, 

393
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,840
because here we have plus 1.5 x² and 

394
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,980
here we have minus 1.5 x². 

395
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,460
This means that it does not correspond to 
the 

396
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,480
functional equation f of x and 

397
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,860
, unfortunately, it also does not 
correspond to the 

398
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,380
functional equation minus f of x. 

399
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
Therefore, there is no 

400
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,720
symmetry in this case. As I said, 

401
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
you could have guessed the whole thing. 

402
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,020
We have even and odd, 

403
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,980
as well as even exponents and this is 

404
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,200
always a very clear sign 

405
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,760
that there is no symmetry. 

406
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,900
However, this must still 

407
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,340
be proven with this calculation. 

408
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,620
Another important point is the 

409
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,780
global behavior or the behavior at 

410
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,200
infinity. 

411
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,380
The advantage of this is that the 

412
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,340
behavior at infinity 

413
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,220
is quite easy 

414
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,840
to determine for completely rational 
functions . With these, you 

415
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,200
only ever have to 

416
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,220
look at the highest power, which in our 

417
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,460
case is the power to the power of 3, and 
of course the 

418
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,320
factor before the highest power. So 

419
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,620
now we only ever have to 

420
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,520
look at the term 1 .5 x to the power of 3 
and think 

421
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,260
, if we now 

422
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,220
use infinity for the x, we get 1 half 
times 

423
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,040
infinity to the power of 3. And now it is 

424
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,060
actually only important to 

425
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,640
pay attention to the signs. 

426
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,380
We have once plus infinity to the power of 

427
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,680
3, which is infinity, and 1 half times 

428
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,900
infinity is infinity. In other words, 

429
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,840
we know that if the x 

430
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,500
tends to infinity, the 

431
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,660
function value also tends to infinity. 

432
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,020
We now do the same for 

433
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,940
the fact that the x tends to minus 
infinity 

434
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,460
. This means that here, too, 

435
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,740
we simply consider the factor 

436
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,780
with the highest power, i.e. 1.5x³. 

437
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,600
In this case, we only 

438
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,200
enter minus infinity for the x. And now 

439
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,780
we get what I 

440
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,280
have just said. We 

441
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,940
have 3 to the power of 3, so we have an 

442
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,100
odd power. And we have 

443
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,240
a minus here. And because we have an odd 

444
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,860
power, the minus remains 

445
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,680
. So we have 1 half times 

446
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,960
minus infinity and that's 

447
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,080
minus infinity. 

448
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,040
Consequently, if the x 

449
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,420
tends to minus infinity, the 

450
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,920
function value also tends to minus 

451
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,880
infinity. And this 

452
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,220
already determines the global behavior. 

453
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,250
Now we come to the extreme points. 

454
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,490
Extreme points. Extreme points of 

455
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,110
functions are simply high or 

456
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,290
low points. And here you can 

457
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,090
already see that this is exactly the 
point. The 

458
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,530
graph rises here all the time 

459
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,510
and falls here. And between 

460
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,550
this rise and fall, there must 

461
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,870
be a very small point where 

462
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,850
the graph runs horizontally. 

463
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,490
This is the point shown in yellow. And 

464
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,070
this is exactly the point we are looking 
for. If 

465
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,950
the graph neither rises nor 

466
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,790
falls, it has 

467
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,210
reached its highest or lowest point. 

468
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,630
This is the train of thought behind 

469
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,590
this condition f' of x equals 0. 

470
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,790
The first derivative f' of x 

471
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,690
describes nothing more than the 

472
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,190
gradient at point x, 

473
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,030
or rather it gives nothing more 

474
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,610
than the gradient at point x. 

475
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,970
And because we are 

476
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,570
looking for the points at which the 
gradient is 0, 

477
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,510
this is the necessary condition. 

478
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,870
Conditions. It is important to note that 
for 

479
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,030
extreme points and inflection points, 

480
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,910
there is a necessary condition and 

481
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,830
a sufficient condition and both 

482
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,290
must be carried out. 

483
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,810
This means that we first calculate 

484
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,150

485
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,510
the potential 

486
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,130
extreme 

487
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,830

488
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,170

489
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,110

490
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,850

491
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,930
point using this condition, which is 
always the same, we do this with the 
necessary condition and then check this 
potential extreme 

492
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,850
point with the sufficient condition at the 
end . 

493
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,830
And that's what we'll do now. 

494
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,810
As I just said, we use 

495
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,230
the first derivative. This means 

496
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,070
that the first thing we have to do is 

497
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,520
determine the first derivative. 

498
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,280
We determine the derivative of a function 
for such 

499
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,740
completely rational functions simply by 

500
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,900

501
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,740
multiplying by our exponent and 

502
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,420
changing the exponent by 1. decrease. 

503
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,480
Now this applies to the function line, 
there 

504
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,200
are many other 

505
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,820
derivation rules that you 

506
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,120
also have to apply depending on the 
function. We 

507
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,300
arrive at 1.5 times 3 times x², so 

508
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,740
the 3 has gone down, the 3 has been 

509
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,360
reduced by 1 and we have 

510
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,740
obtained the 2. Then minus 1.5 times 2 
times 

511
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,380
x, the 2 simply written in front of it, 

512
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,980
the 2 and 1 reduced is a 1 and 

513
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,140
we see that here too, 

514
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,860
we don't always write the 1. With 

515
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,580
the linear element, the minus 3x, 

516
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,160
the x is simply dropped and so 

517
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,620
a minus 3 appears from minus 3x, 

518
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,740
here minus 3. 

519
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,240
Of course, you can 

520
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,560
simplify the whole thing a little. 1.5 
times 3 is 3 halves 

521
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,100
or 1.5 and minus 1.5 times 2 is 

522
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,300
simply minus 2 halves or minus 1. 

523
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,280
And that's why the 1 is 

524
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,580
dropped again, 

525
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,520
leaving only a minus x and the minus 3 
remains 

526
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,810
as it is. We 

527
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,290
equate this first derivative to zero and 
thus obtain 

528
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,090
this equation. This is another 

529
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,590
quadratic equation 

530
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,150

531
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,870
that can be solved using the PQ formula or 
the midnight formula. 

532
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,390
In this case, the two equations are 

533
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,190
root 19 plus 1 third or minus 

534
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,710
root 19 minus 1 third. Because 

535
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,070
extreme points are required, 

536
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,310
the Y-coordinate must also 

537
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,830
be calculated. It is very important to 

538
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,030

539
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,550
determine the y-coordinate whenever a 
point is required. 

540
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,730
That is why we have 

541
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,250
done this before. This is minus 4.14 or 
2.03 

542
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,490
for the second solution. This is 

543
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,330
the necessary condition for now. 

544
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,170
But of course, as we 

545
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,750
have just said, we still have to 

546
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,410
carry out the sufficient condition 

547
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,010
in order to determine whether it really is 
an 

548
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,710
extreme point. What kind is 

549
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,190
it? High or low point? Or is it 

550
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,210
perhaps not one at all? 

551
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,630
There are two possibilities. Firstly 

552
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,110
, there is the option of 

553
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,070

554
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,310
carrying out the necessary condition via 
the second derivative. This means that we 
have to 

555
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,070
derive the first derivative again. 

556
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,730
We then arrive at 3x-1. Or we can 

557
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,830
do the whole thing using a 

558
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,430
monotonicity table by means of the 

559
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,130
sign change criterion. We 

560
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,210
have simply 

561
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,190
done both here. 

562
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,410
However, it is most common to do this 
using the second derivative 

563
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,590
, because it is quicker 

564
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,770
Especially if you also 

565
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,930
have to determine the inflection points , 
you have to 

566
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,290
determine the second derivative anyway And 

567
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,370
then I would always 

568
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:32,170
choose this method here We simply insert 
both 

569
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,930
solutions into the second derivative 

570
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,410
This means that we insert 

571
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,990
our solution for x1 once for x 

572
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,930
, i.e. root 19 plus 1 third 

573
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,450
, and once our x2, which is 

574
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,210
then minus root 19 minus 1 third. 

575
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,230
And then we calculate the 

576
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,750
function values in each case. And what we 

577
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,570
are really only interested in is 

578
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,450
whether the function value 

579
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,390
is greater than 0 or less than 0. If the 

580
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,270
function value is greater than 0, we have 

581
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,270
a low point. If it is less than 0, 

582
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,670
we have a high point. 

583
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,750
This means that in this case we have 

584
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,930
a low point at x1 because it 

585
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,130
is greater than 0 and 

586
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,970
a high point at x2 because it is less than 
0 

587
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,110
. If we 

588
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,990

589
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,690
want to use or solve the whole thing with 
the monotonicity table , we 

590
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,650
first write down the two points 

591
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,110
that we have calculated. So our 

592
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,130
x1 and x2, or that is 

593
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,370
our x2, that is our x1. And then 

594
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,050
we need one place 

595
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,330
to the left and one to the right. we then 
calculate 

596
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,090

597
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,090
the value of the first derivative 

598
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,510
of these two chosen places , i.e. if we 

599
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,170
imagine a ray of teeth, we would 

600
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,590

601
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,110
choose a value to the left of it , let's 
say minus 

602
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,570
10, and one right in between 

603
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,470
, for example 0. if we 

604
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,170
do this for our case here 

605
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,230
, we find that 

606
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,090
the graph rises to the left of our 
solution x2 and 

607
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,670
falls to the right of our solution. 

608
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,370
This means that we have a 

609
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,550
change of sign from rising to 

610
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,770
falling. Rising is a 

611
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,930
positive function value and 

612
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,090
falling is a negative one. Hence the 

613
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,890
term change of sign criterion. 

614
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,990
And the change from rising to 

615
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,670
falling is a high point. 

616
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,310
We do the same with the first solution 

617
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,570
x1. We now need a 

618
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,450
value to the right of it, so 

619
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,490
let's take a C. And then we have 

620
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,890
falling to the left of it and 

621
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,390
rising to the right of it. That means it's 
a 

622
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,110
low point. And that corresponds exactly to 

623
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,470
what I said here 

624
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,330
. So as I said, the monotomy 

625
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,310
 table is one solution. 

626
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,630
However, it is usually done using the 

627
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,490
second derivative, unless this is 

628
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,430
very difficult to determine. 

629
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,920
Well, of course you can also 

630
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,600
use the monotonicity table 

631
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,320
if you 

632
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,760
have to determine the monotonicity 
behavior anyway. 

633
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,740
But I think that is also quite clear. Now 
we come 

634
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,520
to inflection points. Turning points 

635
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
are precisely the points at which 

636
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
the curvature behavior of a curve 

637
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,660
changes. Or where the 

638
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,720
curvature behavior of the function 

639
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,400
changes. It is also important here that we 

640
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,480
have inflection points. This means that we 

641
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,600
must also determine the 

642
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,900
 y-coordinate. We 

643
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,700
still  have the same 

644
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,940
function equation. And here 

645
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,140
we can see this now. This is still 

646
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,560
the graph of even. Here was 

647
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,540
our high point, here our 

648
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,840
low point. And if you imagine that 

649
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,220
we 

650
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,100
always read a graph like this from left to 
right, then 

651
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,880
the curvature is now to the right. So 

652
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,300
if we imagine it as 

653
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,580
driving a car, we would 

654
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,020
drive a right-hand bend up to a 

655
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,280
certain point, then suddenly we drive 

656
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,600
a left-hand bend 

657
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,620
right-hand bend left-hand bend and 
somewhere 

658
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,820
between this right-hand bend 

659
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,460
and left-hand bend there must 

660
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,280
be a point where it changes and 

661
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,880
that is this change of curvature and 

662
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,580

663
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,880
we calculate this point of the change of 
curvature using the inflection points, 

664
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,280
the necessary condition for this is 

665
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,680
f' of x equals 0. 

666
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,760
So we calculate the extreme points of the 
first 

667
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,000
derivative . The first derivative 

668
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,540
indicates the gradient. And this is 

669
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,520
really to be understood as the 

670
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,880
graph is curved to the right. 

671
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,220
This means that the curvature increases. 

672
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,480
At some point, we reach the point 

673
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,860
where the curvature 

674
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,240
decreases again . yes, it always goes 

675
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,500
downwards more steeply , if you like, and 

676
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,700
here it becomes 

677
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,040
flatter again and again. And the 
inflection point is the 

678
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,240
point with the steepest gradient 

679
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,500
between the two extreme points. 

680
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,940
This is why we 

681
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,340
only calculate extreme points of the first 

682
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,680
derivative or extreme points of the 

683
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,560
gradient function. 

684
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,710
To calculate the 

685
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,470
extreme points , we therefore set the 
second derivative 

686
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,390
equal to 0 and calculate these. 

687
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,010
As mentioned earlier, is there 

688
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,790
also a sufficient condition here 

689
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,010
? For the sufficient 

690
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,930
condition for inflection points, we 

691
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,830
simply use the 

692
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,210
result calculated for the necessary 
condition, the 

693
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,910
third derivative. And there is also 

694
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,630
the 

695
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,930
distinction between left-right 

696
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,230
 inflection point, so this would be 

697
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,290
a right-left inflection point in the 

698
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,730
example, and not an inflection point. 

699
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,170
Alternatively, a 

700
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,570
curvature table is also possible, which 

701
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,170
we will see in a moment. First, 

702
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,070
of course, we have to 

703
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,610
carry out the necessary conditions, which 
means, 

704
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,350
as already mentioned, we set 

705
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,990
the second derivative equal to 0, 

706
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,410
i.e. 3x-1 equal to 0 and calculate 

707
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,990
our solution. This is a simple 

708
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,150
linear function or a linear 

709
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,430
equation that we can solve without 

710
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,330
any tools. 

711
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,470
Simple transformation, we arrive at 

712
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,850
e. x is equal to a third and we 

713
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,510
now go and characterize the 

714
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,850
inflection point using the curvature 

715
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,230
table. The 

716
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,230
curvature table works in the same way 

717
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,170
as the monotonicity table. 

718
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,530
Once again, we take the calculated value 
in the 

719
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,350
middle, then a value to the left of it 

720
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,410
and then a value to the right of it, 

721
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,890

722
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,250
but this time we insert these two values 
into the second derivative 

723
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,250
, i.e. we always take the 

724
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,570
derivative with which we 

725
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,130
have also carried out the necessary 
condition. 

726
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,410
For the 

727
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,450
monotonicity table, i.e. for 

728
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,970
extreme points, this is the first 
derivative. 

729
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,210
For inflection points, it is 

730
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,750
the second derivative. And then there will 

731
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,670
also be a 

732
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,370
change of sign here again 

733
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,210
. So we see here that it is 

734
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,070
less than 0, so it is probably a 

735
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,410
negative number that is here. greater 

736
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,110
than a positive number and so 

737
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,570
we know 

738
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,630
that the 

739
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,730
curvature behavior changes from curved to 
the right to curved to the left. So we 
have 

740
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,750
a change of sign and it is 

741
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,290
therefore definitely an inflection point, 

742
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,050
namely a right-left inflection point. 

743
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,790
Just as we have already 

744
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,860
seen in the sketch. We 

745
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,160
also enter this here at the top and you 
can 

746
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,720
slowly see that there is more and more 
here. 

747
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,560
Here we can see everything that we 

748
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,820

749
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,780
have calculated in this binary. First of 
all, we have our 

750
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,260
function equation, our 

751
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,000
zeros, our y-intercept and 

752
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,640
our inflection point. It's important to 
note that 

753
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,940
the inflection point would have been a 

754
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,740
third, i.e. 0.33. We've 

755
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,980
added the y-coordinate to the whole thing 

756
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,480
so that we 

757
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,840
get the point. Then we see 

758
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,040
the global behavior below and here we see 

759
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,000
our extreme points. 

760
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,960
Last but not least, we 

761
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,120
enter all of this. Using this 

762
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,380
information that we 

763
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,660
have calculated, we 

764
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,220
could have shown that the graph 

765
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,660
comes from down here and 

766
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,820
goes up here. This is the global behavior. 

767
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,880
We know that if x 

768
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,340
tends to minus infinity, the graph 

769
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,660
also tends to minus infinity. That 

770
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,380
means it is somewhere down here. That's 
where 

771
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,700
it starts. And we know that if 

772
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,400
our x tends to infinity 

773
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,160
, the graph, i.e. the function value, also 
tends 

774
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,120
to infinity. In other words, 

775
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,040
we know that it 

776
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,820
goes up here. Then we know the 

777
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,320
zeros. So at the minus 2, 

778
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,820
at the zero and at the 3. Then 

779
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,960
we also knew our 

780
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
extreme points. That was once here 

781
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
and once here. And if you 

782
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,960
plot all these points, you can 

783
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,080
visualize this curve very well 

784
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,720
and 

785
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,560
make a very accurate sketch . Last but not 
least, let's 

786
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,000
briefly 

787
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,500
summarize the most important points. That 
was the 

788
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,460
calculation of the zeros, 

789
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,700
extremes and inflection points. For 

790
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,500
zeros, it is simply a case of 

791
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,960

792
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
setting the necessary conditions f of x 
equal to 0. So we set the 

793
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,280
equation of the function equal to 0 and 

794
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,900
there is no sufficient condition. 

795
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,560
For extreme points, we set the 

796
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,020
first derivative f' of x equal to 0 

797
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,180
. And as a sufficient 

798
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,940
condition, we insert the 

799
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,980
x' calculated in the necessary condition 

800
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,700
into the second derivative. If the 

801
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,440
function value of the second derivative 

802
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,160
is less than 0, there is a maximum, 

803
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,000
i.e. a high point. If the 

804
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,460
function value of the second derivative 

805
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,000
is greater than 0, there is a minimum, 
i.e. 

806
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,120
a low point. If it is equal to 0, 

807
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,480
there is a good chance 

808
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,920
that it is a saddle point. 

809
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,420
The whole thing must then be checked again 
by 

810
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,200

811
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,500

812
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,600
substituting the solution from the 
necessary conditions into the third 
derivative. 

813
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,500
The function value must then be unequal to 
0 

814
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,200
for it to be a saddle point. 

815
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,560
The alternative here is to 

816
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,260

817
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,940
use a monotonic table, as we have also 
shown. For the 

818
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,920
inflection points, the necessary 

819
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,280
condition f' of x is 0 

820
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,100
, so we set the second derivative 

821
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,300
equal to 0 and calculate the x. 

822
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,200
We insert this x into 

823
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,220
the third derivative in the sufficient 
condition 

824
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,320
and calculate the function value. 

825
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,620
is less than 0, there is a left-right 

826
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,020

827
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,360
inflection point and if it is greater than 
0 , there is a right-left inflection 
point. 

828
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,920
In general terms, 

829
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,120
if the function value 

830
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,460
of the third derivative is not equal to 0, 

831
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,900
there is an inflection point and if it 

832
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,020
is equal to 0, there is no inflection 
point 

833
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,620
. The alternative to this would be the 

834
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,740
curvature table as we 

835
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,720
have shown it. As I said, the 

836
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,920
curvature table and 

837
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,460
monotonicity table are always useful 

838
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,800
if you do not necessarily 

839
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,880
need the next higher derivative and 

840
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
the next higher derivative 

841
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,500
is difficult to determine. Or you have 

842
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,440

843
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200

844
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,700
to determine the monotonicity behavior of 
the graph anyway with the monotonicity 
table . That brings us to the 

845
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,580
end of the webinar. Thank you 

846
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,500
very much for your 

847
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,220
attention.
