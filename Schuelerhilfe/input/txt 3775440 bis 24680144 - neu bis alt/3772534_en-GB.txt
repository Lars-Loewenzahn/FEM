00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,420
Hello, my name is Nick and I am a 

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,820
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,680
Today I would like to explain something 
about 

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,040
the human immune system. 

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,240

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,500

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,920

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,420
You can also find more content on this and 
many other topics, such as wikis, 
worksheets and interactive tasks, 

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,940
in our online 

10
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,580
 learning center. 

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,060
There are many different inhabitants in 
our body. 

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,100
Some are useful, others are not. 

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,800
Our immune system has the important 

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,500
task of differentiating between them 

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,380
. But what do we 

16
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,660
actually mean by the immune system? 

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,260
The human immune system 

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,040
is the body's biological defence system 

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,600
, which 

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,420

21
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,120
is made up of specialized cells and 
organs. Its task is to 

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,520
combat and eliminate 

23
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,960
pathogens that 

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
infiltrate our organism. In addition to 

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
bacteria , these can be viruses, fungi 

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
or parasites. 

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,580
Many 

28
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,640
potential pathogens are found in our blood 
in particular . Therefore, 

29
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,040
a relevant part 

30
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,920
of our immune defense is also found in our 

31
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,740
blood vessels. The most important 

32
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,780
components of this are the white 

33
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,400
blood cells. There are two types 

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,520
of white blood cells, phagocytes 

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,760
and lymphocytes. Phagocytes 

36
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,500
specialize in 

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,600

38
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,940
eating up dirt, dangerous bacteria, dying 
and dead cells. The 

39
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,580
lymphocytes enable the body to 

40
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,120

41
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,660
recognize known invaders and thus help the 

42
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,620
body to destroy them. The 

43
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,100
immune response is divided into 

44
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,040
non-specific and specific 

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,380
defenses. The non-specific 

46
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,220
immune defense is innate and consists 

47
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,600
of the non-specific 

48
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,000
cellular defense and the 

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,980
non-specific humoral defense 

50
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,200
. Both systems 

51
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,780
build on each other and complement each 
other. 

52
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,660
The primary responsible 

53
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,480
components of the specific defense 

54
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,300
are the B lymphocytes of the humoral 

55
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,480
immune system and their antibodies and 

56
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,300
the T lymphocytes of the cellular 

57
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,980
immune system. The B lymphocytes 

58
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,100
form the intelligent system that 

59
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,160
identifies intruders and 

60
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
attaches itself to them. In doing so, they 
inform 

61
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,920
the T lymphocytes, which then 

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,680
destroy them. Furthermore, 

63
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,360
antigens and antibodies as well as 

64
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,880
plasma cells are part of the 

65
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,480
human body's specific immune defense 

66
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,860
, which ensure a rapid 

67
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,880
immune response 

68
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,400

69
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,460
should the same pathogen attack the system 
again. It is 

70
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,280
a defense mechanism that 

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,380
acts specifically against known pathogens. 
This 

72
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,800
happens because the cells 

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
of this defense system have already had 

74
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,580
contact with these invaders 

75
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,380
and 

76
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,320
can therefore remember them. This enables 
the 

77
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,120
specific immune system to 

78
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,720

79
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320

80
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,560
act quickly and effectively when the same 
pathogen attacks again. 

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,040
However, this ability only develops in the 

82
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,600
course of growing up and is 

83
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,180
therefore still insufficiently 

84
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,660
developed in children. It comes into play 

85
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,060
when the non-specific defence system 

86
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,200
is overwhelmed and cannot 

87
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,560
neutralize the pathogens . 

88
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,020
In the next step, let's take a closer look 
at the organs 

89
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,300

90
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,480
involved in the immune response. The 
immune system includes, 

91
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,640
for example, the thymus, the 

92
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,800
bone marrow, the spleen, the tonsils 

93
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,380
, the lymph nodes and special 

94
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,480
blood cells. They are all involved in 

95
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,820
neutralizing pathogens. 

96
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,860
Other tasks of the immune system 

97
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,180
include the 

98
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,900
control of endogenous and 

99
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,480
harmless microorganisms, 

100
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,360
tumor defense and wound healing. 

101
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,520
You can also actively 

102
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
influence the function of your 

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,140
immune system, both positively and 

104
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,420
negatively. The immune system 

105
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,020
can be positively 

106
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,680

107
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,620
influenced by nutrition, vitamins and 
minerals . 

108
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,620
The immune system is weakened by 

109
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,220
a lack of nutrients, stress, alcohol or 

110
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,520
smoking. I'm glad you could join us 

111
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,600
. I hope I 

112
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,940
was able to give you an understanding of 
our immune system. 

113
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,940
