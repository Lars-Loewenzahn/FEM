00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,620
Hello, my name is Nick and I am a 

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,120
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm pleased to 

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,300

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,080
be able to explain something about the 
human eye to you today. In addition to 
this video, 

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,540
you can also 

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,260
 find a wiki 

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,320
on this topic in our online learning 
center, where 

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,560
the most important terms and 

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,420
basics are explained. We 

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,180
humans have amazingly 

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,180
well-developed eyes, even compared 

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,760
to primates. In our 

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,180
past, the ability to 

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,020

16
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,140
spot snakes and other enemies from a great 
distance or to distinguish ripe 

17
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,620
from unripe fruit was 

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,260
essential for our survival. To 

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,520
see in the dark, we can 

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,220
even dilate our pupils to 

21
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,380
let in more light. A 

22
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,020
good way to 

23
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,600

24
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,420
arm ourselves against the many dangers of 
dusk and dawn. But how does 

25
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,400
the eye actually work? And 

26
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,840
how can we even see with it? 

27
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,700
Objects reflect light. 

28
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,380
Seeing means 

29
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,940
processing the reflected light rays in the 
eye. 

30
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,500
The light rays have to pass through 

31
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,360
the crystal-clear cornea, in which 

32
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,220
the light is refracted, and through 

33
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,760
the pupil, a hole in the iris 

34
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,340
which, depending on the brightness, is 
either 

35
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,320
larger when it is dark or smaller 

36
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,600
when it is light. On their long 

37
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,940
journey through the lens, the 

38
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,460
light rays are bundled further and 

39
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,600
cross each other. This is why the image 

40
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,940
on the retina is reversed 

41
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,700
. At a point above the 

42
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,660
optic nerve, information is 

43
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,640
passed on to the brain where it is 
reassembled 

44
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,560
into a correct image 

45
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,620
. For this process to 

46
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,160
work properly, we need 

47
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
more or less healthy eyes. 

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,320

49
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,400
Let's take a look at exactly how they are 
constructed. 

50
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,700
The most important components of the 

51
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,140
human eye are the cornea, 

52
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,900
the pupil, the iris or iris 

53
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,540
membrane, the 

54
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,100
ciliary muscle, the lens, the 

55
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,420
vitreous body, the sclera, the 

56
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,700
choroid, the retina and the 

57
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,080
optic nerve. Many of these structures are 

58
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,600
extremely sensitive. As good 

59
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,340
eyesight 

60
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,060
was even more vital for our ancestors than 
it is for 

61
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,640
us, we humans have 

62
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,420

63
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,820
developed various mechanisms and organs 

64
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,480
to protect our eyes. 

65
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,680

66
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,260

67
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,680
I will now explain the most important of 
these organs, the eyebrows, eyelashes, 
lacrimal fluid and eyelids, 

68
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,980
in more detail. The eyebrows serve to 

69
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,020
protect the eyes from sweat, wetness, dust 

70
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,480
and other foreign bodies 

71
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,880
and thus support the function 

72
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,300
of the eyelashes the eyelashes 

73
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,120
protect the eyes by catching 

74
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
small dirt particles or 

75
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,080
foreign bodies the tear fluid 

76
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,160
serves to remove foreign bodies by 

77
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
playing out or evenly 

78
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,620
moisturizing the cornea it forms 

79
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,660
a lubricant for 

80
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,200
the low-friction gliding of the eyelids 

81
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,880
over the eye and helps to 

82
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,820
ward off pathogens. The eyelid 

83
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,020
is the muscularly mobile 

84
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,780
soft tissue fold that 

85
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,580
can protectively cover the eyeball from 
the front. 

86
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,060
Above all, it prevents 

87
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,660
the eyeball from drying out and protects 
against 

88
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,400
external mechanical influences. 

89
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
However, 

90
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,880
not everyone's vision works equally well. 

91
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Many people suffer from short-sightedness 

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,940
or long-sightedness. The causes of 

93
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,640
these visual defects can be varied 

94
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,100
. For example 

95
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,440
, short-sightedness can be caused by 

96
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
an eyeball that is too long. Let's take a 

97
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,620

98
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,540
closer look at the two groups of 
short-sightedness and long-sightedness. 

99
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,360
Short-sightedness is a congenital 

100
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,180
or acquired visual defect of the 

101
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,020
eye. People who are short-sighted 

102
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,640
can usually still see well up close, 

103
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,540
while objects in the distance 

104
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,140
appear blurred. 

105
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,780
The opposite is true for long-sighted 
people. 

106
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,440
This means that a short-sighted person 

107
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,940
does not generally have poorer vision 

108
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,900
; at close range, they may 

109
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,640
even be superior to someone with normal 
vision. 

110
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,240
People who 

111
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,740
cannot see close objects clearly are 
considered far-sighted 

112
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,840
. This is usually due to the 

113
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
eyeball being too short. In order for 
ophthalmologists and 

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,440
associated engineers 

115
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,700

116
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,160
to be able to make vision corrections or 
glasses, it is necessary to 

117
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,940
determine the visual defect precisely. 

118
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,540
The most important unit for 

119
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,420

120
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,100
describing the strength of 
long-sightedness or short-sightedness is 
called the diopter. 

121
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,400
The unit of measurement diopter 

122
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,700
is used in ophthalmic optics 

123
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,780
to describe how strongly a 

124
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,220
spectacle lens must refract light in order 
to 

125
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,120
correct a visual defect 

126
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
. Put simply, the 

127
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
strength of the lenses is 

128
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
given in diopters. However, 

129
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,820
people who are completely blind and 

130
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,380
therefore have no use for glasses can also 

131
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,440
make use of various 

132
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
aids. 

133
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,580
The best-known aids include 

134
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,320
guide dogs, canes for the blind 

135
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,600
and even echolocation. 

136
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,300
The blind person makes a sound 

137
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,940
and can 

138
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,480
recognize how far 

139
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,080
away a potential obstacle is based on the 
echo . 

140
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,480
I hope you now know more about 

141
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,780
how the human 

142
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,040
eye works. If you have any further 
questions about 

143
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,360
