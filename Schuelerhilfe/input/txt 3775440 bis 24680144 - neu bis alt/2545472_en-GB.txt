00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,700
Curve Discussion of a Fractional 

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,160
Rational Function. In 

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,360
this webinar we will 

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,620

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,080
perform a curve discussion of a fractional 
rational function. 

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,680
Many of the criteria and necessary 

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,660
conditions are similar to those 

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,040
we 

10
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,080
know from completely rational functions. 

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,620
We will also see a brief overview 

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,980
of the things we 

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,440
will calculate and look at today. 

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,420
First of all, we will take a look at our 

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,220
function, which is 

16
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,760
always the same except for one point in 
the webinar 

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
, so we will 

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,520

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,780
carry out the curve discussion using the 
function that we are about to present. 

20
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,200
The first thing you should 

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,500
always do with a fractional rational 
function 

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,780
is to 

23
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,300
determine the domain. This should always 
be the first thing 

24
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,200
you do and then you can 

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,480

26
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
start with the actual curve discussion and 

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760

28
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,980
swap the elements listed here as you wish. 

29
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,860
We then continue with the 

30
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,820
zeros and the 

31
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,080
 Y-intercept. This means 

32
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,240
that both together are 

33
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,420
the two points of intersection with the 

34
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,900
coordinate axes. 

35
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,540
We will then calculate the pole points and 

36
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,900
go into more detail about what pole points 
are 

37
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,280
and what the difference is between 

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,860
a definition gap and a 

39
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,520
pole point. Then we will look at the 

40
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,800
global behavior, the 

41
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,820
symmetry behavior and of course the 

42
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,240
classics, extreme values, emergency 
values, 

43
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
sufficient conditions. for the 

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
extreme points, i.e. what kind of 

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,880
extreme points are there, then 

46
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,680
we will look at the monotonic 

47
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,080
behavior and finally at 

48
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,280
inflection points and curvatures and there 

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,380
is a special feature to note 

50
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,720
that I will say now and 

51
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,020
finally we will look at the whole of 

52
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,600
this fractional rational function 

53
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,540
once as a graph and then 

54
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,520
I think everything that 

55
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,620
you have calculated before becomes 
understandable how 

56
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,180
to interpret it graphically well First 

57
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,140
we see here our 

58
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,340
function equation f of x equal to x² 

59
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,500
minus 4 by x² minus 1. 

60
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,160
So this is really a fractional rational 

61
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,280
function. A fractional rational 

62
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,580
function 

63
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,100
is characterized by the fact that it also 

64
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,740
contains our variable in the denominator 
and this is 

65
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:04,980
not the 

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,900
fractional rational function. 

67
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,260
As already 

68
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,540
mentioned , we will use this as the basis 
for the curve discussion in a moment 

69
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,280
. However, we will focus more on 

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,100
the conditions and the 

71
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,000
calculation methods. We will not 

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
necessarily go into solving 

73
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,700
equations in depth. 

74
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,420
We will only touch on this and 

75
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,500
generally mention the important 

76
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,300
things, which 

77
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,400
may be 

78
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,960
different for a fractional rational 
function than 

79
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
for a completely rational function. 

80
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,760
Well, let's start right away 

81
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,340
with the domain of definition. 

82
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,800
The domain of a 

83
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,960
fractional rational function is 

84
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,980
always 

85
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,720
restricted by the fact that the 
denominator 

86
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,160
must not contain a zero. After all, we 
know that 

87
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,540
we are not allowed to 

88
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,180
divide by zero in mathematics . A fraction 

89
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,760
is actually nothing more than a division 

90
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,960
. We are dividing by x²-1 

91
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,100
, so the denominator polynomial, as it 

92
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,080
is also called, or the denominator 

93
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,460
term must never be zero. This means that 

94
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,060
we first calculate our 

95
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,500
x, which would result in 

96
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,540
a 0 in the denominator. 

97
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,180
We therefore set the denominator 

98
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,200
equal to 0 and solve this equation. We 

99
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,480
see that the equation is then x²-1 

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,720
is equal to 0. It is therefore a purely 

101
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,080
quadratic equation, for which we 

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
do not 

103
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,700
need a higher solution method , not even a 
pq formula. We 

104
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,160
simply rearrange it so that the x 

105
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,500
stands alone and then take the 

106
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,260
root. So we calculate plus 1, then 

107
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,620
we have x² is equal to 1. 

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,640
Then we take the 

109
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,260
root and arrive at x is equal to 

110
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,720
plus minus 1. So we know that the 

111
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,640
domain excludes the x 

112
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,100
 values 1 and minus 1. Yes, this is 

113
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,620
noted here. 

114
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,280
The domain includes all 

115
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,700
real numbers. This change 

116
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,880
is called except 1 and minus 1, and that 

117
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,320
is our domain of definition. 

118
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,520
We must 

119
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,600
always keep this in mind in the following 
, because you 

120
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,180
can often get solutions that 

121
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,680

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,140
are then excluded by the domain. 

123
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,080
Of course, this must also be 

124
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,460
mentioned at the point of origin. 

125
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,400
We can now see a somewhat 

126
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
bare foil here. This is the slide on which 

127
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,120
we 

128
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,340
will always collect our intermediate 
results. 

129
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,120
This will of course fill up as 

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,820
the webinar progresses . At the moment, 

131
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,060
we only know the domain of definition, 
which 

132
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,900
includes all real numbers except 

133
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,240
1 and minus 1. Next, 

134
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
we will 

135
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
continue with the zeros . The necessary 
condition for 

136
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,080
a zero is 

137
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
exactly the same for fractional rational 
functions 

138
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,540
. So this function value 

139
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
should be 0, or we 

140
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,960
set f of x equal to 0. 

141
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,560
The beauty of this is that with a 

142
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,000
fractional rational function or 

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,360
a fraction in general, a fraction 

144
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,980
always takes on the value 0 if 

145
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,940
the numerator is 0. This means that when 
we 

146
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,780
equate f of x with 0, 

147
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,580
we simply look to see when the 

148
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,560
numerator polynomial, i.e. the term in the 

149
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,640
numerator, has a zero. 

150
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,360
So we just set the 

151
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
numerator equal to 0 and then 

152
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,520
the equation looks much simpler 

153
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,100
. So x²-4 is equal to 0 and this 

154
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,960
is again a purely 

155
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,480
quadratic equation. This means 

156
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,820
that we now calculate plus 4, where x² 

157
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,500
is equal to 4 and now take 

158
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,340
the square root again and arrive at plus 

159
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,640
minus 2. This means that our 

160
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,680
function equation has 

161
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,360
a 

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,640
zero at the plus and minus 2 points. 

163
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,960
Of course, we now have to make sure that 
these 

164
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
zeros are not accidentally 

165
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,040
excluded by a domain. In this case they 
are 

167
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,360
not, they are both 

168
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,980
elements of our definition set. 

169
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,180
This means that only... And so 

170
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,460
they are actually zeros. 

171
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,610
Of course, it is not always so 

172
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,290
easy to solve these equations. 

173
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,270
Of course, there can also be quadratic 

174
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,190
equations in the numerator or 

175
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,270
cubic or similar. Then 

176
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,970
, of course, you need solvents such as 

177
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,950
polynomial divisions, 

178
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,510
the midnight formula or the PQ formula. 

179
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,990
This is of course not 

180
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,330
impossible, it doesn't always have to 

181
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,130
be purely quadratic. 

182
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,730
Well, we can see that we have 

183
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,610
already 

184
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,890
added our two zeros here. Well, the 

185
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,230
zero had the 

186
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,910
 y-coordinate 0, so it was 

187
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,790
no longer calculated separately. 

188
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,710
So we have the points 2,0 and minus 2 

189
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,950
,0 as zeros. 

190
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,150
Now we come to the intersection 

191
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,510
with the y-axis. In contrast to the 

192
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,970
 x-axis 

193
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,290
, there is only one point of intersection 
with the y-axis . 

194
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,450
and this intersection point 

195
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,790
is simply calculated 

196
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,490
by inserting the value 0 for the x we 
calculate f from 

197
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,810
0 yes and that is then 0 to the power of 

198
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,070
2 minus 4 by 0 to the power of 2 minus 1 
so 

199
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,710
this time we really need counters 

200
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,050
and denominators we can also 

201
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,570
enter this in the calculator because 

202
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,750
the 0 is 

203
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,230
also contained in our definition set that 

204
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,230
means we can also calculate this we 

205
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,930
then get minus 4 by minus 1 

206
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,630
please note minus and minus falls 

207
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,670
out and 4 by 1 is 4 that means 

208
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,950
we have the intersection point with the 

209
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,150
y-axis at 04 and we have the intersection 
point with the y-axis at 04 axis at 04 and 
with that we have 

210
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,870
now also 

211
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,560
determined the intersection points with 
the coordinate axes 

212
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,360
we also enter this again in folie and 

213
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
think you can see quite well the folie 

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,780
feels gradually we 

215
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,420
now come to the poles and poles are 

216
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,460
a thing that is only 

217
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,920

218
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,720
known with fractional rational functions 
which we 

219
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,820
do not know with the completely rational 
functions. 

220
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,460
Pole points are the points at which 

221
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,660
the function is not defined. 

222
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,460
However, it is very important to note that 

223
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,920
pole points also have 

224
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,920
the property that the 

225
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,420
function value tends to infinity 

226
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,020
. This means that in order for the 

227
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,120
function value to approach infinity 

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,580
, it must be ensured that we 

229
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,600
do not 

230
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,720
have a zero of the numerator at the pole 
point. In other words, we 

231
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,640
simply have to check whether one of our 

232
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,440
two... zeros 

233
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,320
are excluded by our domain. 

234
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,840
In this case, it is not. We have only 

235
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,280
not 

236
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,780
defined the 1 and the minus 1. Our zeros 
were 

237
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,460
at 2 and minus 2 respectively, which 

238
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,280
means that this is 

239
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
not the case for us. So we 

240
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,320
really do have a pole position. 

241
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,840
Once it has been clarified that we 

242
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,660
definitely have a pole position 

243
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,680
, we can 

244
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,840
of course 

245
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,000
describe this pole position in more 
detail. In other words, we can 

246
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
say whether the graph tends towards 

247
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,840
infinity or towards minus infinity 

248
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,040
and whether there is 

249
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,160
still a change in it. That's what you do 

250
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,620
next. 

251
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,020
But first you should really make sure that 

252
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,220
it is a pole. Very 

253
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,900
importantly, a defining hole can 

254
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,720
only be a pole if 

255
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,400
the same zero of the denominator did not 

256
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,300
also occur in the numerator. This 

257
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,700
simply means that the zero of the 
numerator must 

258
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,200
lie in the domain of definition and 

259
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
not 

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,780
be excluded by the domain of definition. 
As I just 

261
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,400
said, this is the case for us 

262
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,280
, so let's move on. 

263
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,410
Well, as we have just said, 

264
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,750
we are now interested 

265
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,290
in this pole position and, more precisely, 

266
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,010
the course of the pole position. 

267
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,160
In order to classify the pole position, 

268
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,420
we cannot 

269
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,200
take the function value in the pole 
position into account, 

270
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,300
because that is 

271
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,760
also a definition gap. In other words, we 

272
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,980
cannot calculate a function value there. 

273
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,420
That's why we have to approach the pole 

274
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,740
from the left and from the right. 

275
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,920
We really approximate using the 

276
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,240
limit. The whole thing then 

277
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,080
looks like this. We once had the 

278
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
poles at minus 1 and plus 

279
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,700
1. Now we have minus 1 plus 

280
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,640
and minus 1 minus. This plus and 

281
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
the minus in the exponent 

282
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,380
indicates that we are looking at a number 
here 

283
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,240
that is slightly larger than 

284
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,140
the minus 1 for plus and that we are 

285
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,320
now looking at a number that 

286
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,040
is slightly smaller than the minus 1 for 
minus . 

287
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,500
This simply helps us to ensure that we 

288
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,220
are not exactly in our polar stillness 

289
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,860
and can calculate something. 

290
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,140
So we 

291
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,780

292
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,960
approach the pole stillness from the left 
for the minus and from the right for the 
plus. Or the 

293
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,360
definition holes. And we 

294
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,940
now have to 

295
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,700

296
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,600
calculate this expression, the limits of 
x-strip against minus 1 plus f of x. This 

297
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,730

298
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,170
means, of course, that we have to 

299
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,090
perform the calculation that follows four 
times. So once for minus 

300
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,330
1 minus, once for plus 1 plus and 

301
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,010
once for plus 1 minus. So 

302
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,670
four times in total. But we 

303
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,870
only do it once. The calculation remains 
the 

304
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,030
same. In order to 

305
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,650
be able to classify the pole position in 
more detail , we 

306
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,550
first have to go and 

307
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,850
factorize the numerator and denominator. 
As we can see, we 

308
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,250
have 

309
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,870
applied the third binomial formula in this 
case. x²-4 

310
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,290
can be written as x-2 times x±2 

311
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,790
or x-1 times x±1. If you 

312
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,670
calculate the pole positions, you have to 

313
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,410

314
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,970
know the zeros of the numerator and 
denominator anyway and then 

315
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,770
you can also 

316
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,690
write it down in factorized form. 

317
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,270
We have already 

318
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,530
done that here. What is written here is 

319
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,710
of course the same for all four cases. 

320
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,590
All you have to do now is 

321
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,910
enter this x-strut against minus 1 plus, 

322
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,410
or 

323
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,250

324
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,790
enter the other cases for the other cases, 
of course . And we've 

325
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,870
done that here. So wherever 

326
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,590
there is an x here, we 

327
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,530
enter a minus 1 plus. This gives us 

328
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,810
minus 1 plus minus 2 

329
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,230
times minus 1 plus plus 2 in the numerator 
, 

330
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,450
minus 1 plus minus 1 and minus 1 plus 

331
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,950
plus 1 in the denominator . In the end, 
we're 

332
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,150
only interested in the continuation 

333
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,550
that results. That's what matters. 

334
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,690
That's why it's always very important that 
plus 

335
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,810
times minus equals minus and minus times 

336
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,950
minus equals plus. We 

337
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,270
first calculate the brackets as far as we 

338
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,950
can. This plus or minus is 

339
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,770
only interesting if we then 

340
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,550
have a zero. In other words 

341
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,430
, we now have minus 1 plus minus 

342
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:42,210
2 here . That's minus 3 together. Then 

343
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,430
we have minus 1 plus plus 2 here. 

344
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,650
That's simply a 1. Minus 1 plus 

345
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,350
2 is 1. As I said, it only becomes 

346
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,650
interesting when a zero is created. 

347
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,110
Minus 1 plus minus 1 is a minus 

348
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,810
2. And now we come to the case of 

349
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,250
minus 1 plus plus 1. Minus 1 plus 1 

350
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,650
would theoretically be 0. And now it 
becomes 

351
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,470
important. Minus 1 plus plus 1. This 

352
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,350
minus 1 plus means that it 

353
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,090
is a number that is a tiny bit 

354
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:13,330
larger than minus 1. 

355
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,470
For example, minus 0.99. 

356
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
And this number is 

357
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,860
minus 0.01. That means it is a 

358
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,580
positive number and that is all that 
matters 

359
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,040
. It's a positive number and 

360
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,520
that's why it's 0 plus. 

361
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,280
And now we're almost 

362
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,320
there. Minus 3 times 1 is minus 3. 

363
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,580
Minus 2 times 0 plus, so minus, because 

364
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,140
plus is minus, so 0 minus. And 

365
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,160
that's all that matters. Because we 

366
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,160
now have minus divided by minus, which 

367
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,660
is already a plus, and 3 divided by 

368
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,000
0, which is therefore tending towards 
infinity. 

369
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,920
In other words, we know that if 

370
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,720
we... 

371
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,160
approach the pole from the right, the 
function value tends to 

372
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,280
infinity and, as 

373
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,320
I said , this is something that we 

374
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,280

375
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,000
will also find in our sketch at the end of 
the webinar . well 

376
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,580
, as I said, this was only 

377
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,060
done for this, exactly the same 
calculation 

378
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,140
we would now have to 

379
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,120
do for the other three, which follows 

380
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
exactly the same principle and the 

381
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,680
form once factorized can 

382
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,140
of course also be used for this. 

383
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,110
the next step is to 

384
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,390

385
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,870
provide a small negative example , namely 

386
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,810
this functional equation has 

387
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,130
no 

388
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,430
poles at the same points, i.e. it has no 
gaps in the definition, 

389
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,190
only because the numerator and denominator 

390
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,670
have their zero at the same point 

391
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:53,750
, and we now want to 

392
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,630
show the example that if this 

393
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,410
is the case, i.e. the numerator and 
denominator have 

394
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,190
their 

395
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,310
zero at the same point , what the 
calculation for this 

396
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,690
looks like. 

397
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,010
Of course, you can already see this when 
you 

398
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,310

399
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,950
calculate the zeros of the function and 
the definition gaps, 

400
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,190
then you realize that the zero 

401
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,410
is in a definition gap. Then 

402
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,710
you can already see it and if you 

403
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,030
also factorize it , which you 

404
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,750
have to do if you 

405
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,570
examine pole points , you can also see it, 
because 

406
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,530
then you can suddenly 

407
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,010
shorten something out. You can see here 
the x plus 

408
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,470
1 and x plus 1. This means that the 
numerator 

409
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,970
and denominator appear to have a 

410
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,630
zero at x minus 1. And this 

411
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,590
shows that the 

412
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,190
same terms arise here , which we 

413
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,430
can then factor out. So whenever 

414
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,230
you have something like this that you 

415
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,250
see in the factored form that you 

416
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,310
can reduce out, then the 

417
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,890
numerator function and the denominator 
function have 

418
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:45,890
a zero at the same point 

419
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,850
. That's why you shorten it 

420
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,350
out and then calculate 

421
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,610
the whole thing again. So x 

422
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,650
minus 2 by x minus 1. We 

423
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,590
look at the point minus 1 plus. 

424
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,490
This means we have minus 1 plus 

425
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,550
minus 2 and minus 1 plus minus 1. 

426
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,570
Minus 1 minus 2 is minus 3. Minus 1 

427
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,650
minus 1 is minus 2. And now we 

428
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,930
have minus 3 divided by minus 2. So 

429
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,310
minus divided by minus is plus. 

430
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,410
And 3 divided by 2 is then 1 

431
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,410
.5. And here you can see that it is now 

432
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,650
exactly the case that it does not 

433
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,070

434
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,790
run towards plus or minus infinity , i.e. 
towards infinity, which 

435
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,510
is the criterion of a pole, 

436
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,070
but approaches a value. And 

437
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,430
that is just a 

438
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,430
definition gap. 

439
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,960
Well, that brings us to the 

440
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,540
behavior at infinity. The 

441
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,640
behavior at infinity is 

442
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,480

443
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,900
calculated much differently for fractional 
rational functions than 

444
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,380
for integer rational functions 

445
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,440
. The good news is that the 

446
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,120
criteria or the approach for the 

447
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,800
axes and the point symmetry is the 

448
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,120
same as we 

449
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,620
know it from integer rational functions. 

450
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,540
The first thing we have to do to determine 
this is to 

451
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,540
convert something. Well, we have to 

452
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,400

453
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
factor out the highest power of the 
denominator and the numerator. 

454
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,700
We really have to do this , otherwise we 

455
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,420
cannot determine the behavior in the 
finite 

456
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,560
. Once again, we have 

457
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
our function equation from earlier, 

458
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,760
i.e. the one we 

459
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,040
used at the beginning , which we'll use to 

460
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,560
discuss our curves and which 

461
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,260
will only be used throughout the 

462
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,780
webinar. That was just 

463
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,760
an example of what it 

464
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,260
looks like if you don't 

465
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,920
have a pole position. So we have x²-4 
divided by 

466
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,900
x²-1 again and now we want to 

467
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,560

468
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,600
determine the global behavior, i.e. the 
behavior in the finite. First, 

469
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,880
we factor 

470
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,720
out the highest factor of the numerator 
and the denominator. 

471
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,800
Of course, it is important for this to 

472
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
work that we 

473
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,400
no longer have the function equation 

474
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,860
in factored form 

475
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,220
. We really have to 

476
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,820

477
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,200
have it in this general form. The 
factorized form will 

478
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,020
only be good. 

479
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,220
I think we can all see the largest 

480
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,660
exponent in the numerator is x² and the 

481
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,120
largest exponent in the denominator is 
also 

482
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,440
x². We want to factor out this x². 

483
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,060
To do this, we simply 

484
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,740
add x² times the brackets. And 

485
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,020
you get everything that' s in here 

486
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,780
by 

487
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,020
dividing this by x² . x² divided by x² is 
1. minus 4 

488
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,260
divided by x² is minus 4 divided by x². 

489
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,940
You do exactly the same in the 
denominator. 

490
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,620

491
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,240
The largest exponent in the denominator is 
now also x². That's why 

492
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,020
we're going to factor it out again. 

493
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,120
We can get the value in brackets 

494
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,940
by dividing this by x². x² 

495
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,320
divided by x² is also a 1 

496
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,600
and minus 1 divided by x² is also 

497
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,120
minus 1 divided by x². Now we have 

498
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,560
reached the point where we 

499
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,920

500
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,520
can let our x run towards infinity or 
minus infinity . The important thing 

501
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,220
here is that our x is in the 

502
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,300
denominator. we have 

503
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,980
a fraction in both the numerator and the 
denominator and so we get 

504
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,000
here plus minus infinity to the 

505
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,780
square and here below also plus 

506
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,760
minus finite to the square but it is 

507
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,920
both times in the denominator and it is 

508
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,440
very important that 1 through infinity 

509
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,500
to the square tends towards zero 

510
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,700
, because we divide the 1 by a very 

511
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,920
large number and whenever you 

512
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,380

513
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,420
divide a small number by a very large one 
, you get a small number. 

514
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,440
In this case, 1 divided by infinity is 0 

515
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,280
, as is 4 divided by infinity. That 

516
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,620
is 0. Now we also have 

517
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,760
the fact that we 

518
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,680
square the number to infinity . It is also 

519
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,620
unimportant whether we 

520
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,660
have plus or minus. And then we also get a 

521
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,280
0. Therefore, it is also irrelevant 

522
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,040
whether we have plus 0 or minus 0. It 

523
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,780
's simply 1 minus 0 divided by 1. So 1 

524
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,260
divided by 1, that's 1. So we know 

525
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,860
that the function for x-stript 

526
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,460

527
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,120

528
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,020
tends to plus-and-finite or x-stript tends 
to minus-and-finite both times. We know 
that now. And 

529
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,260
we will also 

530
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,200
be able to recognize this later on the 
graph. 

531
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,050
Of course, other numbers are also 

532
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,430
conceivable. So it could just as 

533
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,970
well be a 0 or 

534
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,450
any other number, i.e. a 5, a 6 

535
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,390
or plus infinity or 

536
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,770
minus infinity. It should also be 

537
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,550
noted that if the numerator 

538
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,850
is exactly one percent larger, 

539
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,070
for example if we 

540
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,010
had x³ instead of x², then we would have 
been 

541
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,230

542
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,250
left with an x if we had truncated both. 
This 

543
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,470
would mean 

544
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,590
that we would have an oblique asymptote. 
This is 

545
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,350
definitely 

546
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,090
worth mentioning. 

547
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Now let's move on to the 

548
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
symmetry behavior. 

549
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,420
As we said earlier, there are 

550
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,980

551
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,660
only two simple 

552
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,340
types of symmetry for fractional rational 
functions. These are 

553
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,260
axis symmetry and 

554
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,520
point symmetry. So these are exactly 

555
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,040
the same two symmetries 

556
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,840
as we 

557
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,320
know from completely rational functions. 
And the 

558
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
conditions for them are also the 

559
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,620
same. For axis symmetry 

560
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,380
, we have f of minus x is equal to f 

561
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,420
of x. This means that it 

562
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,920
doesn't really matter whether you 

563
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,600

564
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,040
enter your variable as positive or 
negative. 

565
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,300
The result is the same either way. The 
point symmetry 

566
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,920
is, or rather the condition for the 

567
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,720
point symmetry is, f of minus x 

568
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,420
is equal to minus f of x. This means 

569
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,200
that if you 

570
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,800
enter your variable with the wrong sign, 
you will 

571
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,680
also get a result 

572
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,540
with the wrong sign. off. And as 

573
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,620
we 

574
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,580
know it from completely rational functions 
, we now check this first, 

575
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,840
except that we now 

576
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,260
have a fractional rational function. 

577
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,380
This means that we simply 

578
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,420
insert a minus x for our x, then 

579
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
we get minus x to the power of 2 minus 4 

580
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,000
by minus x to the power of 2 minus 1. Now 

581
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,140
it is very important that we have 

582
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,620
an even power both times, which is 

583
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,120
why our sign is omitted. 

584
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,560
So minus x² becomes x² both times. 

585
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,700
And we see what we 

586
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,880
get here , x² minus 4 by x² minus 

587
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,900
1, which is again our 

588
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,720
initial function f of x. 

589
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,660
So f of minus x is equal to f of 

590
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,940
x. I'll go 

591
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,120
back one page for a moment. This is the 
criterion for 

592
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,300
axisymmetry. Consequently, our 

593
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,340
function is axisymmetric to the 

594
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,940
 y-axis. And that 

595
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,020
already 

596
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,440
clarifies  the symmetry behavior. 

597
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,720
Now we come to extreme values or 

598
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,040
extreme points. To do this, we 

599
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,400
first need the first derivative, which 

600
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,280
is somewhat more difficult to calculate 

601
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,780
for fractionally rational functions. 

602
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,420
With fractionally rational functions 

603
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,060
, you always need the 

604
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,600
quotient rule to derive them . This is 
very 

605
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,540
important. The quotient rule is 

606
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,660
denominator times the 

607
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:34,240

608
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,380

609
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,580

610
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,780

611
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,220

612
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,380

613
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,100

614
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,480

615
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,940

616
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,700

617
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,520
derivative of the numerator minus the 
numerator times the derivative of the 
denominator yes and the whole thing 
divided by the quotient to the square - as 
I said, this is the quotient rule. In the 
case of a fractional function, a 
distinction is always made between a 
numerator and a polynomial and this should 

618
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,380

619
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,300
of course not be interchanged, especially 
in the case of the derivative 

620
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,060

621
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,820
. This is always a 

622
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,860
bit easier to calculate. So 

623
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,920
if you 

624
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,780
were to factor it out now , you would 

625
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,160
only end up making life more difficult for 
yourself. So it' 

626
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,440
s better to leave it like this. This is 
now 

627
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,200
our first derivation 

628
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
and we'll continue with it. 

629
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,060
Here too, the 

630
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,980
necessary conditions and the 

631
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,060
sufficient condition for the 

632
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,340
extreme points 

633
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,540
do not change for completely rational 
functions. This means 

634
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,240
that here too, with a fractional 

635
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,280
rational function, we set the 

636
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,060
first derivative equal to 0 in order to 

637
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,880
carry out the necessary condition. And 

638
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,060
then we also carry out the 

639
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,220
sufficient condition. So 6x through x²-1² 

640
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,040
is equal to 0. We are now only looking 

641
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,020
for zeros of the first derivative 

642
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,620
and we can see that the first derivative 

643
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,120
is also like a fractional rational 

644
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,500
function. Therefore, we are now 

645
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,940
only looking at the numerator function 
again, 

646
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,360
i.e. 6x is equal to 0. 

647
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,560
We now solve this equation , x is then 
equal to 0 

648
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,540
accordingly. 

649
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,840
Of course, this equation does not always 
have to 

650
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,660
be so simple. In other words, we 

651
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,440
now know that we have a 

652
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,740
potential extreme point at 0. Now 

653
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,900
, as we know, there are two 

654
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,640
ways to 

655
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,700
determine the type of extreme point or to 
first 

656
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,900
determine whether there 

657
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,460
is one at all . On the one hand, this can 
be done using 

658
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,200
the second derivative or using a 

659
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,280
monotonicity table. The 

660
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,140
monotonicity table 

661
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,680
is of course useful if we 

662
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,100

663
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,880
have to determine the monotonicity 
behavior of the function anyway. 

664
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
This is the case with us. We have just 

665
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,720
seen in the overview at the beginning 

666
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,680
that we also have to determine the... 
monotonicity 

667
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,820
. That's why I would 

668
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,500
go this way at this point. 

669
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,220
Of course, it is also possible to 

670
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,020
use the second derivative 

671
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,960
. This means that we 

672
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,420
insert our calculated point into the 

673
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,720
second derivative and if the 

674
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,040
result is greater than 0, 

675
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,220
there is a low point. If it is less than 
0, 

676
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,320
there is a high point. And if it 

677
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,900
is not equal to 0, then we must 

678
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,420
suspect that it is a 

679
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,100
saddle point. 

680
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,720
Let's take a look at 

681
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,160
our second derivative, f' 

682
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,660
of x, which is equal to minus 18x² 

683
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,140
minus 6 by x² minus 1 to the power of 3. 

684
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,720
This second derivative has also 

685
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,340
been calculated using the quotient rule. 

686
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,860
And we can now insert the 0 into this 

687
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,360
, then we simply get 

688
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,180
minus 6 by minus 1 to the power of 3. That 
is 

689
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,820
minus 1 to the power of 3, that is minus 
1. We 

690
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,680
then get the 6, because minus by 

691
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,200
minus is plus. And the 6 is greater 

692
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,900
than 0, so 

693
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,780
there is a low point. We can also 

694
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,040
prove the whole thing with the 
monotonicity table. 

695
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
First, we take 

696
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,840
the point in the middle where the 
potential 

697
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,700
extreme point is, i.e. x equals 

698
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,680
0. Then we go a little to the left 

699
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,900
of it and a little to the right of it. 

700
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,880
It is important to note that with 
fractional 

701
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,600
rational functions, 

702
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,980
you should not go beyond your 

703
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,560
definition gap. We 

704
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,220
have a definition gap at the minus 1 or at 
the 

705
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,200
1. This means that 

706
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,180
the x that we insert here must 

707
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,220
be less than 0, but at the same time 

708
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,760
greater than minus 1. The x that 

709
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,380
we insert here must 

710
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,360
be greater than 0, but at the same time 
less 

711
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,900
than 1, so that we don't 

712
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,480
go over our definition gap. 

713
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,540
If we do this, we get 

714
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,600
a result smaller than 

715
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,300
0 on the left, i.e. the graph falls. To 
the right 

716
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
of this, we get a result greater than 0, 
i.e. 

717
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,520
it rises. So we have a 

718
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,940
change of sign from minus to 

719
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,360
plus, i.e. from falling to rising, and 

720
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,920
that is a low point. 

721
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,700
I think you can already visualize this 
graphically 

722
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,960
. Here it is falling straight 

723
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,420
up, which is a low point, i.e. 

724
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,360
a minimum. And that 

725
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,440
already 

726
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,280
characterizes the type of extreme point. 

727
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,590
We also wanted to 

728
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,030
determine the monotonic behavior and here 

729
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,310
you can see what I just 

730
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:04,110
mentioned. 

731
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,870
We have the location of our extreme point 
and 

732
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,810
then a location to the right or left 

733
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,210
of it, but of course this is also 

734
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,310
between minus 1 and 0 or 

735
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,070
between 0 and 1. You must 

736
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,550
not 

737
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,350
go beyond our definition gap. If we 

738
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,910
want to determine the monotonicity 
behavior 

739
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,790
, we also go to the left 

740
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,210
or right of the definition gap 

741
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,050
and always calculate 

742
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,010
the first derivative for these values and 
look 

743
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,170
at the sign. 

744
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,430
the gradient is here we see 

745
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,390
to the left of the mini from 1 to that 
means 

746
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,730
to the left of our left 

747
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,410
definition gap the graph falls 

748
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,970
to the right of our left 

749
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,050
definition gap it also falls 

750
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,830
and now we see to the right of 

751
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,890
our extreme point it rises that 

752
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,390
means here a sign change from 

753
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,070
minus to plus and to the right of the 

754
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,030
right definition gap it 

755
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,270
also rises again and we can 

756
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,690

757
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,230
notice all of this in our graph again and 
this 

758
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,770
clarifies the monotonic behavior here 

759
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,510
we see it again falls falls 

760
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,970
rises rises around the low point 

761
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,150
we have the change from falling to 

762
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,570
rising so definitely a low point 

763
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,490
next we come to 

764
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,290
turning points and curvature. With 

765
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,710
fractional rational functions, it is 

766
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,390
very important to keep in mind 

767
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,670
that a fractional rational 

768
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,410
function 

769
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,410
can have a change in curvature even though 

770
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,010
it does not have an inflection point. This 
is 

771
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,450
a big difference to completely 

772
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,750
rational functions. 

773
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,370
However, a fractionally rational function 
can still 

774
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,770
have the classic inflection point 

775
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,570
. That is why we first 

776
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,750
check for such an inflection point. This 
is done 

777
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,530
as we know it, 

778
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,910
i.e. we need the second 

779
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,530
derivative and set it 

780
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,970
equal to 0. 

781
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,930
We already had the second derivative 
earlier with the 

782
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,630
monotonicity table, which is exactly the 

783
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,490
same as the one here. We 

784
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,930
now set it equal to 0, here too, the 

785
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,030
second derivative is again a 

786
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,790
fractional rational function and it 

787
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,190
will look for the zeros, that's how 

788
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,750
it should be interpreted. That's why 

789
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,150
we only take the numerator and set 

790
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,090
it equal to 0. So minus 18x² 

791
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,830
minus 6 equals 0 and we will find that 

792
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,370

793
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,710
there is no solution to this equation. 
Because we 

794
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,970
can now calculate plus 6, then 

795
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,750
we would divide by minus 18 

796
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,330
. Then we would have something 

797
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,870
negative and then we would have to 

798
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,230
take the root of a negative number 

799
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,330
and that is not possible. In other words, 

800
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,570
not equal to 0, no solution and there are 

801
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,590
obviously no 

802
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,410
turning points for the time being. 

803
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,590
However, we have to 

804
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,450
characterize the whole thing using the 
curvature table. Because, as I just 

805
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,790
said, even if we don't have an 

806
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,430
inflection point, the 

807
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,910
curvature can change. 

808
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,210
That's why we now use such a 

809
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,990
nice table for the curvature. 

810
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,830
First of all, we see here... minus 1 and 
1, 

811
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,230
our two definition gaps 

812
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,990
again. We can 

813
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,830
now hide the low point here. In other 
words, we 

814
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,470
only need one digit from the, 

815
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,270
finally, one digit to the left of the 

816
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,050
definition gap, one digit to the right 

817
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,470
of our right definition gap 

818
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,750
and one digit in between. So 

819
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,410
conceivable values here would be 

820
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,250
one minus 2, here a 0 and 

821
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,930
here a 2, for example. 

822
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,810
We then calculate the second 

823
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,150
derivative for these values. This means 
that 

824
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,530
for a digit 

825
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,230
smaller than minus 1, it is 

826
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,830
less than 0, i.e. curved to the right. 

827
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,410
Between minus 1 and 1 we have 

828
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,050
a value that is greater than 0, which 

829
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,870
means it is curved to the left and for 

830
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,790
a value greater than 1 it is 

831
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,250
again less than 0, which means it 

832
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,350
is again curved to the right. And here 

833
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,350
we see that we have 

834
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,870
right-curved, right-curved, 

835
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,770
left-curved, right-curved. We 

836
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,970
definitely have a change. And 

837
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,910
we're still holding on to that. Well, that 

838
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,590
's the information we' 

839
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,830
ve gathered so far and we 

840
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,550

841
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,150
'll take a look at the graph in a moment. 
This is the graph 

842
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:22,510
and we can see here, 

843
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,850
let's start with the low point. This is 

844
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,330
our low point and we can also see... 

845
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,290
The low point is exactly at the 

846
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,070
intersection with the y-axis. This is 

847
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,330
also here. Here we can see 

848
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,770
the two zeros that we 

849
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,490
have calculated. And we can see that if 

850
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,230
we 

851
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,690
approach minus 1 or 1 , our graph runs 
away, which 

852
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,650
is how you want to formulate it. 

853
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,270
That's why these are our 

854
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,790
definition gaps. So once here, 

855
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,490
or are pole points that we 

856
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,430
have found out. And here. 

857
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,770
Furthermore, we see... 

858
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,630
The graph falls to the left of the left 
pole point, and 

859
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,730

860
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,770
the graph falls to the right of the left 
pole point , as we have 

861
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,470
calculated. If we now look at the 

862
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,370
right-hand pole, i.e. 

863
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,310
this one, we see that 

864
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,270
it rises to the left of the right-hand 
pole, here, 

865
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,730
and 

866
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,290
it continues to rise to the right of the 
right-hand pole. We can also see 

867
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,070
here that the function is approaching the 

868
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,650
value 1, as we have already 

869
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,810
calculated, and this is what the graph 

870
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,610
looks like at the end. The 

871
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,410
change in curvature is yes, here it is 
curved 

872
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,290
to the right, here it is 

873
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,370
curved to the left and here it is 

874
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:34,950
curved to the right again. This means 

875
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,210
that there is a change of curvature within 
the 

876
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:42,050
pole positions. And that brings us to 

877
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,510
the end of the webinar. 

878
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,130
Thank you very much for your 

879
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,810
attention.
