00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,040
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,240
Stochastics webinar . In 

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,820
this webinar, we will look at the basics 
of 

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,440
stochastics. In other words, we will start 
with 

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,340
some basic concepts, look at 

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,880
the difference between 

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
absolute and relative 

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,220
frequencies and also 

9
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,980
explain how to determine them. 

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,600
In stochastics, or when 

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,740
calculating probabilities 

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,160
, you actually always need the 

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,640
relative frequency. 

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,340
More will be 

15
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,640
said about this at this point. We then 
look at 

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,280
the relationship between event 

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,380
and counter-event. In the course of this 

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,040
, we will also explain what the 

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,920
counter-event is. Finally, 

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,860
we will look at two examples. 

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,840
We have a small 

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,300
application example on the topic of 

23
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,040
the clock model and then we look 

24
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,280
at the conditional 

25
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,600
probability and 

26
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,360
the conditional probability is 

27
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,000
also 

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,760
explained using a small example 

29
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,330
. 

30
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,530
It is really only decided 

31
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,730
between true and false 

32
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,270
. There is nothing in between. 

33
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,910
There are only these two possibilities. P 

34
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,310
of this event X is then 

35
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,790
simply the 

36
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,370
probability of 

37
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,530
event X occurring . We have a 

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,010
small example here. We see that we 

39
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,830
have a jar. 

40
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,270
There are two red and one gray ball in it. 

41
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,350
And now we can go there. And 

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,130

43
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,490

44
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,050

45
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,150
calculate the probability of a gray ball 
being drawn and the probability of a red 
ball being drawn . If we 

46
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,970
look at the red ball, we would 

47
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,210
write for P of X is equal to R. 

48
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,190
That means we want to 

49
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,150
have the event X , a red ball. And how 

50
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,150
exactly we arrive at this fraction 

51
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,610
will be explained again in detail in a 
moment. 

52
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,050
I'll do it in 

53
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,890
short form now. But the counter at the top 

54
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,790
always shows how many balls we have, 

55
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,690
or how many 

56
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,890
possibilities we have for 

57
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,830
event X, i.e. a red ball, 

58
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,130
to occur. We have two balls that 

59
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,690
we can draw, which is why there is 

60
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,790
a 2. The denominator at the bottom always 
shows 

61
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,450
the total number of all possible 

62
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,990
events. In other words, it 

63
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,670
always says how many balls are 

64
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,730
generally in the urn or in the jar, 

65
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,490
i.e. how many different balls 

66
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,710
we could draw, the 3 and 

67
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,070
so we come 

68
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,490

69
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,570
to two thirds for the probability of 
drawing a red ball , which is 

70
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,310
basically 66.7 percent. of 

71
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,940
course you can also 

72
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,180
draw a gray ball , so now b of x is 

73
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,200
equal to b, which is shown here in gray 

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,500
is probably supposed to be blue and there 

75
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,180
it is, the fraction or 

76
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,520
probability is 

77
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960

78
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
formed according to the same principle as 
for the reds . You first look at the 

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,140
narrator to see how many possibilities 

80
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,100
I have to achieve my event. 

81
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,260
In other words, how many blue balls 

82
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,980
do I have in the urn? In this case, only 

83
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,520
one. And then in the denominator 

84
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,480
, we look at how many balls do 

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,860
we have left? Three of them, and that 
brings 

86
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,520
us to a third, which is 33 

87
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,160
.4 percent, which brings 

88
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,730
us to a very important point. 

89
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,990
In the rest of the 

90
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,730
webinar , we will often see this x with 
this 

91
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,210
horizontal line above it, which 

92
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,750
is called x across, and this x 

93
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,370
across is the opposite event 

94
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,250
of x, which means that we have just 

95
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,470
said that there are only two 

96
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,870
possibilities: either it happens 

97
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,870
or it doesn't happen. And it is precisely 

98
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,590
this principle that is used here. 

99
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,450
In other words, if event X is that a 

100
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,930
red ball is drawn, then the 

101
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,590
counter-event is quite simple: 

102
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,710
no red ball is drawn. If we 

103
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,110
define event X as "I hit 

104
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,590
at least three times", the 

105
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,890
counter-event is "I hit at most 

106
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,370
three times". 

107
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,210
And this is also how it works with the 

108
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,630
other examples. I roll an 

109
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,510
even number of dice . Or I roll 

110
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,530
an even number of dice . Regardless of 
whether this is a 

111
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,350
singular or a plural. The 

112
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,010
opposite event would be that I roll odd 

113
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,530
numbers. 

114
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,640
Finally, we have the example 

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,100
that actually amounts to the same thing 

116
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,180
as example 2: I eat 

117
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,800
at most three apples. The 

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,540
counter probability is then 

119
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,340
simply that I eat at least three 

120
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,740
apples. Then this maximum is 

121
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,200
exchanged for the minimum. in 

122
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,620
the counter probability, in the 

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,360
counter-event. 

124
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,220
Knowing counter-events and 

125
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,240
using them very often. This is because the 

126
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,820
counter-event has a very 

127
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,320
special relationship to the event. 

128
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,900
We'll see that again in a moment. 

129
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,540
But first , let's explain the absolute 

130
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,200
frequency. 

131
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,810
The absolute frequency of e, 

132
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,030
this small n is an indication of 

133
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,830
how often the experiment 

134
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,010
was carried out. Yes, and the E indicates 

135
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,790
what kind of event 

136
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,990
it is. We also have another 

137
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,110
example here. Our 

138
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,070
example is that a die is 

139
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,730
rolled 500 times. In total, you get 

140
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,650
a 6 85 times. What is 

141
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,710
the absolute frequency? 

142
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,410
In other words, we first know that we have 

143
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,190
rolled the dice 500 times. So we have 

144
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,750

145
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,230
carried out our random experiment 500 
times. That's why A is at 

146
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,030
the bottom of index 5 of E, i.e. our 

147
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,190
event is the same, so we 

148
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,710
now enter what our event was, and 

149
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,430
that was a 6-dice. And the 

150
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,290
absolute frequency 

151
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,770
really only indicates how often 

152
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,170
the event ultimately 

153
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,730
occurred. In other words, how often 

154
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,370
did we 

155
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,790
roll a 6 in this case , which is 85 times, 
and therefore 

156
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,270
A in the C500th of E equals a 

157
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,710
six-dice up to 85. Consequently, 

158
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,030
our absolute frequency is 

159
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,250
simply 85. And this is how you 

160
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,770
really form the absolute frequency. 

161
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,210
It simply indicates how often the 

162
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,440
event has occurred. 

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,980
The relative frequency is different . The 

164
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,960
relative frequency is so called because 

165
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,740
the number is set in relation 

166
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,180
to the... 

167
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,020
And it is set in relation to 

168
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,060
how often the random experiment 

169
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,080
was carried out. In other words, we 

170
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,680
carry out the experiment n times. 

171
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,320
That is the small n. And the 

172
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,700
event E occurs k times. 

173
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,600
That is the k. In other words, we have 

174
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,260
our dice experiment again here. When 

175
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,380
we 

176
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,400
determine the relative frequency , we 
divide our 85 by 

177
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,700
the number of times we 

178
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,860

179
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,800
have carried out the random experiment , 
i.e. by 500. 

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
And so we arrive at 0.17 or 17%. 

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,400
And this relative frequency could 

182
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,940
also 

183
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,300
be seen as the probability that a 

184
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,650
six will be rolled. 

185
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
The relative frequency has the 

186
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,120
small r and the index 

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,480
also shows how often the 

188
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,260
random experiment was carried out. 

189
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,820

190
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,360
The event is also shown in brackets, i.e. 
E a 

191
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,920
six-dice. This has not 

192
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,940
changed from the previous example. 

193
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,180
The only important thing is that in 

194
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,620
the relative frequency, the number 

195
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,120
of times the event occurred 

196
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,560

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,080

198
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,920

199
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
is divided by the total number of trials 
or, in this case , the number of dice 
thrown 

200
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,290
. 

201
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,730
And that is the relationship 

202
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,650
between the event and the 

203
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,770
counter-event. I 

204
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,890
have already said that there are only two 

205
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,470
possibilities. Either our 

206
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,750
event X occurs or the 

207
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,310
counter-event X occurs transversely. 
Therefore 

208
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,350
, the probability of 

209
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,790
our event X, i.e. P of X, plus 

210
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,990
the probability of the 

211
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,110
counter-event is always 100%. In other 

212
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,850
words... Let's take the 

213
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,230
dice example again. I only roll the dice 
once 

214
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,010
and I say that my event E is that 

215
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,300
I roll a 4. The counter-event 

216
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,460
is then simply that I don't roll a 4. 

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,660
And I think it's easy 

218
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,860
to imagine that if I roll this 

219
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,420
dice now , I have exactly two 

220
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,560
possibilities as to what happens. 

221
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,320
Either I roll a 4, which 

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,060
would be my event, or I don't roll a 

223
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,560
4, which would not be the event. One of 

224
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,920
these two cases is 100% 

225
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,160
true . That really is the case. That's why 

226
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
this equation or 

227
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,000
formula applies . 

228
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,860
Here we also see another 

229
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,520
example, if p of x is 0.25 and p 

230
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,280
x² is 0.75. Simply because 1 

231
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,460
minus 0.25 is 0.75. It is 

232
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,160
also very often a good idea to 

233
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,340
calculate using the counter-event. 

234
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,780
Here we have a small 

235
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,980
example of the clock model. We can 

236
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,440
also see a small tree diagram here. 

237
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,900
And if you 

238
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,480
have a multi-stage random experiment like 
this, 

239
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,560
you always have to look at whether you 

240
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
have with or without backing. This is 

241
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,180
very important information. If 

242
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,640
you can't find this information, 

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,360
it's important because without it 

244
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,900
you can't 

245
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,140
solve the task correctly. Here we see 
another 

246
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,900
beautiful urn from the beginning. We have 

247
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,260
a blue one, which appears gray here 

248
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,800
, and two red ones. We draw twice, 

249
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,020
but don't put it back. This means that 

250
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,080
we are now creating our tree diagram 

251
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,240
. 

252
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,020

253
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,820

254
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,960
The probability of each color is written 
on the lines here. In other words, 

255
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,780
we start at the top here and now 

256
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,120
we can either draw a red 

257
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,220
or a blue. 

258
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,160
The probability that we draw a 

259
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,860
blue ball is one third. 

260
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,500
The probability that we draw a 

261
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,060
red ball is two thirds. 

262
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,220
This is simply because we have 

263
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,560
a blue ball in our urn, 

264
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,610
red balls in the urn and a total of 

265
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,430
three lines. Very importantly, these 

266
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,470
two probabilities 

267
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,310
must always add up to 1 and 1 

268
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,190
third plus 2 thirds is really 

269
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:24,430
1. Because we 

270
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,390
carry out the random experiment without 
putting anything back 

271
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,190
, if we 

272
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,110
are now here with blue , this is to be 
understood as 

273
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,530
we have drawn and have 

274
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,330
pulled out a blue ball. And then 

275
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,830
we have to consider, there are 

276
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,810
many. that is not certain, again 

277
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,930
the variant of drawing blue or 

278
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,090
drawing red. And if we have already 

279
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,230
drawn a blue ball and we 

280
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,970
don't put it back, we think about 

281
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,610
how many blue balls we 

282
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,570
still have in the urn. That's 0, so the 

283
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,070
number here is 0. How many balls 

284
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,070
do we have in total? 2. that is 

285
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,070
0 half and that is 0. i 

286
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,010
think you can imagine that 

287
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,370
if 

288
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,970
there is only one blue ball in the urn i 
can't 

289
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,510
pull out two blue balls so there 

290
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,370
is a probability of 0 here and the 

291
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,110

292
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,830
principle is exactly the same for the red 
ball we 

293
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,870
have pulled out one blue ball 

294
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,310
and are now considering how many 

295
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,830
red balls we still have in there we have 

296
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,690
only pulled out one blue ball 

297
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,450
so far so we still have two red balls 

298
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,770
and we still have two 

299
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,490
balls in total. That's the 

300
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,210
probability, two halves and that 

301
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:38,790
's number one. 

302
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,540
As I said, whenever you 

303
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,160
have a tree diagram like this and you have 
the 

304
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,360
example without putting it back, 

305
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,340
the denominator 

306
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,300
always decreases by one the further you 

307
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,280
go down , unless you shorten it. The same 
was 

308
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,780

309
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,460
done here on the right-hand side with the 
red sphere. Now 

310
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,820
imagine that a red ball has been 

311
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,900
drawn, then think about 

312
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,500
the probability 

313
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,520
of blue, how many blue balls do 

314
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,080
I have left? If I am here with red, 

315
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,540
I have only 

316
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,360
drawn out one red ball , which means there 
is still 

317
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,020
one blue ball in the urn. And so 

318
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,580
we have one through and two more, 

319
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,100
because we have two balls, so 

320
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,340
the probability is 1.5. 

321
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,880
Of course, we can, or rather we have to, 

322
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,180

323
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,700
specify the probability of another red 
ball. 

324
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,340
Again, we have already 

325
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,620
drawn out one ball , a red ball. Then 

326
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,420
we only have one more red 

327
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,900
ball and a total of two, which is why 

328
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,420
it says 1.5. Here below, it is 

329
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,180
also true that the 

330
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,200
probability plus 1 

331
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,000
must add up to 1 . 0 plus 1 is 1, 1.5 plus 
1.5 

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,420
is also 1. This means 

333
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,840
that everything has been calculated 
correctly here . 

334
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,060
Now we come to the last 

335
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,780
topic, namely conditional 

336
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,680
probability. The basic principle 

337
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,440
of conditional 

338
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,420
probability is that 

339
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,260
two independent events 

340
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,960
are linked together. This 

341
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,780
also leads to a special 

342
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
notation. This notation P 

343
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,880
to E' F' is pronounced as 

344
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,840
the probability for the 

345
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,060
event. under the condition f and 

346
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
if you really 

347
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,900
approach this as an event then this f, 
i.e. 

348
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,780
what 

349
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,500
is behind the rightmost line , is also 

350
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,900
drawn into the index pf of e and this is 
then 

351
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,940
equal to the probability for e 

352
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,700
and f divided by the 

353
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,980
probability of f this 

354
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,280
p under the condition f is 

355
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,620
nothing more than the 

356
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,300
probability for the event E 

357
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
under the condition that the 

358
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,740
event F has really occurred. 

359
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,180
Such tasks are 

360
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,320
actually always calculated in the 
four-field 

361
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,880
table. However, it is also possible to use 

362
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,260
a tree diagram. In the 

363
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,780
following , we will use the four-field 
table. 

364
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,060
We have a small example here. 

365
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,480
We want to have the 

366
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,660
probability P that it 

367
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,040
will be a 1.0. is under the 

368
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,960
condition that it is a boy. 

369
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,920
In other words, we look for the 

370
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,680
probability of boys with 

371
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,960
a 1-0 school leaving certificate and 
divide this 

372
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,100
probability by the 

373
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,460
probability of a boy. 

374
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,120
We'll see exactly what this looks like 

375
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,160
in a moment. First, we'll see the 

376
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,120
text of the exercise. And with four-field 

377
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,220
 tables it is actually always the case 

378
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,700
that there is such a task text 

379
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,760
and the 

380
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,260
four-field table is 

381
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,700
to be created on the basis of this text. 
The 

382
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,540
probability that 

383
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,580
one boy out of all students 

384
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,160
has a 1.0 Abitur average is PAJ equal to 

385
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,000
0.005. In other words, this is the 

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,120
probability that it is a 1.0 

387
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,540
Abitur average and that it 

388
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,040
is a boy. The school management knows that 

389
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,280
a total of 5% of all students 

390
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,580
will achieve a 1.0 Abitur. 50% 

391
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,460
of all students are girls and 

392
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,040
do not have a 1.0 average. This 

393
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,560
information is entered into a 

394
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,120
four-field table. J stands 

395
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,640
for boys, J' are not boys, 

396
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,280
so in this case girls. A 

397
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,400
stands for the 1.0 Abitur, A' for no 

398
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,060
1.0 Abitur. We have just 

399
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,560
been told that 0.005 of 

400
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,780
boys have a 1.0 Abitur 

401
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,560

402
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,620

403
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,360

404
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,200

405
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,080

406
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,280

407
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,200
average , or the probability that a boy 
has a 1.0 Abitur average is 0.005. 
Furthermore, the school management knows 
that a total of 5% of pupils 

408
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,500
have a 1.0 Abitur average. From this we 
can, therefore 

409
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,360
we can calculate this 0.05. 

410
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,480
Because these 5% are 

411
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,270
 made up of boys and 

412
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,430
 non-boys, i.e. girls. 

413
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,710
That's why they are on the right here. And 

414
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,970
in the four-field table, it is always 

415
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,250
the case that the two events, i.e. 

416
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,050
this plus that, must add up to this. That 

417
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,370
plus that must add up to that. That plus 

418
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,790
that must add up to that. And 

419
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,350
there must always be a 1 at the bottom 
right. 

420
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,290
We can therefore 

421
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,350
calculate this 0.045 directly. 0.05 minus 
0.005 

422
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,850
is 0.045. This means that we can 

423
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,850
say that the probability 

424
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,150
for a girl with a 1.0 A-level average 

425
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:02,530
is 0.04 5. So 4.5%. 

426
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,130
It was also mentioned that 50% 

427
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,410
of the students are girls who do not have 
a 1 

428
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,890
.0 Abitur average. They 

429
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,010
also appear here again. And with 

430
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,710
these two elements we can 

431
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,150
now calculate the element below. 

432
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,350
So that plus that then that. This brings 

433
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,250
us to 0.545. As I just 

434
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,130
said, there is always 

435
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,270
a 1 at the bottom here , so we can 

436
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,950
calculate 0.455 . 1 minus 0.545 is 0.455 

437
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,310
. Once we have this, we can 

438
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,850
also 

439
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,150
calculate the penultimate element at the 
top here. That's this one, because 0 

440
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:48,730
.455 minus 0.05 is 0.45. And so, 

441
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,850
if we 

442
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,430
add the two together, we get 0.95. 

443
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,550
Our four-field table is now complete. And 

444
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,450
we can answer the questions. 

445
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,090
We now have the 

446
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,010
question, determine P, J under the 

447
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,610
condition A'. Here we 

448
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,030
simply use the 

449
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,630
formula shown at the beginning. That is, P 
of J and A' 

450
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,530
by P of A'. This is then 0.45 

451
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,650
divided by 0.95, i.e. 47.4%. Determine P 

452
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,570
of J, that's practical. 

453
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,410
We can read off P from J directly. That's 

454
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,190
45.5% then. That's simply this. 

455
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,830
And P of A J'. In other words, we form 

456
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:34,910
P of A and J and have to 

457
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,510
divide this by P of J'. As 

458
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,410
I said, J' is this element. P of A and J' 

459
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,750
is this element. And so we arrive at 

460
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,730
8.3%. We are now at the end of the 

461
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,450
webinar. I hope you enjoyed 

462
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,610
it and thank you 

463
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,070
very much for your attention.
