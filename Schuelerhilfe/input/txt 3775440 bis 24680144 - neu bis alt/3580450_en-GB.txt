on Friday. What about Saturday? Yes,

let's meet Saturday. Would you like 

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,820
to go ice skating? No, I hate ice 

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,000
skating. What about the cinema? I

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,660
don't like movies. Let's go shopping.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,220
Great idea. The shopping mall opens

at 10 o'clock. Okay, let's meet there
