00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,300
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,380
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,400
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,120
explain acid-base titration to you. 

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,900
In our online learning center, you can 

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,320
of course also 

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,000
find a wiki on this topic, where 

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,280
the basic and important 

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,840
terms are explained in more detail. 

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,700
This video builds on the content of the 

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,980
Neutralization video, which is why 

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,680
it is best to 

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,440
watch this video first. Another possible 

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,320
application of the 

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,200
concentration of substances in addition to 

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
neutralization is 

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,680
titration. This also involves 

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,060

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,380
neutralizing an acid with a base . In this 
case, the 

20
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,620
concentration of one of the 

21
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,700
reactants is unknown and needs to 

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,940
be determined. To do this, the 

23
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,340
solution of unknown concentration is 

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,360

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,720
titrated with a solution of known 
concentration . The experiment is set up 

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,780
as follows. 

27
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,400
There is a known volume of 

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,060
an acid in a beaker 

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,460
, but its concentration is unknown. This 
is 

30
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,500
mixed with an indicator. 

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,620
A burette containing the 

32
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,680
so-called titrant, also 

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
known as a standard solution, which 

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,180
is a base of known concentration, is 
placed on top . 

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,400
The titrant solution is now added to the 
acid drop by drop 

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,040
until the indicator 

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,160
changes colour to show that the acid 

38
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,000
has been neutralized. We make a note 

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,660
of the volume of our standard 

40
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,260
solution used. 

41
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,720
The concentration of the acid must now 

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,040
be calculated in the evaluation of the 
experiment. We will go 

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,920
through this together and 

44
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,760
you will also learn how an experimental 
protocol 

45
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,480
is structured. First comes the 

46
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,980
task. 20 milliliters 

47
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,100
of nitric acid are 

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,140

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,580
titrated with sodium hydroxide solution, C 
is equal to 0.1 mol per liter. Calculate 
the 

50
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,520
concentration of the acid. 

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,040
Secondly, set up the experiment. As 
already 

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,500
described, we need a 

53
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,040
burette with the sodium hydroxide solution 
with 0.1 

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
mol per liter and a beaker with 

55
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,520
20 ml nitric acid, the 

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,660
concentration of which we are to 
determine. 

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,860
Thirdly, implementation. 

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,200
The measurement results are documented 
here. 

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,920
The filling level of the burette before 

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,080
and after the experiment is read and 

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,200
written down. The difference between the 

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,960
two values is our used 

63
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,120
volume. By the time the 

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,360
indicator turns over , 12.5 ml of 
measuring solution has been 

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,700
used. Now, fourthly, comes the 

66
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,340
evaluation. Now we 

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,940
calculate the 

68
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,360
concentration of 

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,820
nitric acid. First, we set 

70
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,500
up the reaction equation again. 

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,640
HNO3 plus NaOH becomes H2O plus 

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,020
NaNO3. Nitric acid reacts with 

73
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,860
caustic soda to form water and 

74
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,260
sodium nitrate. What luck! 

75
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,440
In this case, we don't have to 

76
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,860
balance anything. Nitric acid and 

77
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,340
caustic soda react in a 

78
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,360
mass ratio of 1 to 1. In the 

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
next step, it makes sense to 

80
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,980

81
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,040
include all known and unknown quantities. 
Firstly, we know the 

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,780
volume of nitric acid, i.e. V of 

83
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,840
HNO3 equals 20 ml. Secondly, the 

84
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,500
volume of the sodium hydroxide solution, 
i.e. V of 

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,620
NaOH is equal to 12.5 ml. And finally 

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,000
, the concentration of the 

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
sodium hydroxide solution, i.e. C of NaOH 
equals 0 

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
.1 mol per liter. The concentration 

89
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,840
of nitric acid, i.e. C of HNO3, 

90
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,620
is unknown. But how do we recognize 

91
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,460
it? The concentration of 

92
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,140
nitric acid is 

93
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,720

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
calculated by dividing the amount of 
nitric acid by the volume of the solution. 

95
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,920
So C of HNO3 is equal to N of HNO3 

96
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
divided by V of HNO3. 

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,900
We know the volume of the solution. We 

98
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,520
only need the amount of 

99
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,500
nitric acid. We already know from 

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,060
the reaction equation that the 

101
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,980
amounts of sodium hydroxide and 

102
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,740
nitric acid must be equal, 

103
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,020
i.e. in a ratio of 1 to 1 

104
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,280
. The amount of 

105
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,780
sodium hydroxide can 

106
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,620

107
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,140

108
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,100
be calculated from the measured volume and 
the given concentration using the 
following equation. n of NaOH is 

109
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,160
equal to c of NaOH times v of NaOH. n 

110
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,180
of NaOH is equal to 0.1 moles 

111
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,980
per liter times 0.0125 liters. And 

112
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,560
note, the volume must always 

113
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,320
be converted to liters. n of NaOH 

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,340
is equal to n of HNO3, is equal to 0 

115
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,500
.00125 moles. Now we have everything 

116
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,800
we need to 

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,680

118
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,960
calculate the concentration of nitric 
acid. So we put everything into 

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
the equation. C of HNO3 

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,820
is equal to 0.00125 mol per 0.02 

121
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,220
liter. The volume again in liters. 

122
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,220
So for the concentration, C of HNO3 is 
equal to 0.0625 moles 

124
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,840
per liter. I hope that you now 

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,860

126
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,360
know more about acid base titration and 
the concentration of substances. If
