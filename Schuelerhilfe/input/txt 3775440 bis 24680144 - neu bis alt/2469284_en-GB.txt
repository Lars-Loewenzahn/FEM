00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,550
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,610
Exponential Function webinar . 

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,790
In this webinar , we will be 

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,410
looking at exponential functions. 

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,910
At the very beginning, we will 

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,110
look at the basics again , followed by the 

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,030
application to compound interest. 

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,970
This is also the largest 

9
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,930
area of application of the 

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,650
exponential function. We will then look 

11
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,730
at two special 

12
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,090
types of growth: 

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,670
limited 

14
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,210
growth and logistic growth. And finally, 
we will 

15
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:28,990

16
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,090
look at the laws of logarithmic calculus 
and 

17
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,270
apply them to 

18
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,690
exponential equations . In other words 

19
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,410
, we will solve a few 

20
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,730
exponential equations. This is 

21
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,850
really important because if 

22
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,410
you 

23
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,590
work with exponential functions , for 
example with 

24
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,650
compound interest, then you also need to 

25
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,110
be able to solve these exponential 
equations. 

26
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,010

27
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,850

28
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,410

29
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,130
We will also see what kind of question you 
have to or should solve an exponential 
equation for in 

30
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,710
a small example. Let's 

31
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,070
start with the basics first. 

32
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,510
We first see the 

33
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,270
exponential function with the form a 

34
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,310
to the power of x. As already mentioned, a 
is the base 

35
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,790
and we see our variable x is 

36
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,830
in the exponent. And what we also 

37
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,430
see, no matter what base we 

38
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,470
take, all exponential functions 

39
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,450
with the format a to the power of x 
intersect the 

40
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,070
y-axes at the point. This is 

41
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,490
simply because of this. No matter which 

42
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,330
numbers you raise to the power of 0, 

43
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,870
i.e. 5 to the power of 0 or 10 to the 
power of 0 or 

44
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,270
1000 to the power of 0, it is always 1. 
Therefore, 

45
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,570
all exponential functions 

46
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,930
with this structure intersect the y-axis 

47
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,850
at the point 1. You can also see that 

48
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,370
the 

49
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,410
exponential functions become steeper as 
the base increases. 

50
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,980
If you now go to the 

51
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,460
exponent with a negative 

52
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,000
sign, which is the red 

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,040
curve here , then you can see that 

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,980
the curve no longer rises and it falls. 

55
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,600
So you have 

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,360
mirrored the function on the y-axis, like 
this. If you 

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,300
give the base a negative 

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,880
sign, for example 

59
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,600
the green curve here, f of x is 

60
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,700
equal to minus 2 to the power of x, then 
you have 

61
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700

62
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,540
mirrored the function along the x-axis . 
So minus 2 to the power of x is 

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,780
along the x-axis, mirrored to 2 

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,180
to the power of x . 

65
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,000
Here you can also see again that if 

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,520
the factor is less than 0, 

67
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,760
the curve falls. 

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,660
This is called a decay 

69
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,260
. A classic example of this 

70
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,080
is radioactive 

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
decay, which you will 

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,600
always encounter in this context, and 

73
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,020
here we see a red f of x equal to 0.3 

74
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,400
to the power of x. This graph falls much 

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,200
faster, while the graph f of x 

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,140
equals 0.7 to the power of x 

77
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,120
falls much slower. This is very 

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,900
important, so the smaller the a 

79
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,040
becomes, the faster it falls or 

80
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,940
the flatter it becomes down here. 

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,010
Now we come to the exponential function 

82
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,450
with the form a times b to the power of x. 
This is 

83
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,010
also the exponential function 

84
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,990
according to which the compound interest 
principle 

85
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,330
works. And this a is then 

86
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,950
the point of intersection with the y-axis. 
This 

87
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,790
is simply related to what I 

88
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,890
explained earlier. 

89
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,330
No matter what base we 

90
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,310
use here for b, if we use a 0 for x 

91
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,150
, it is always 1. There is 

92
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,970
always a times 1. And therefore 

93
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,790
we always intersect the y-axis 

94
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,310
at the point 1. We see here once 

95
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,270
the function f of x equals 3 times 2 

96
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,810
to the power of x and once f of x equals 2 

97
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,810
to the power of x. And you can see here 
very 

98
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,870
clearly that the gradient is actually 

99
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,570
always approximately the same, except that 
it 

100
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,730
is higher here by a factor of 3. And we 

101
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,490
see that the function f of x equals 3 

102
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,650
times 2 to the power of x intersects the 
y-axis 

103
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,650
at point 3, the function f of x 

104
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,390
equals 2 to the power of x at point 1. 

105
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,780
That's all we 

106
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,960
can say . Now let's move on to 

107
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,100
the application of compound interest. 

108
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,720
In the compound interest calculation, we 

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,300
always use this approach Kn is equal to K0 

110
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,560
times Q to the power of N. Kn is the 
capital after 

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,860
N years. K0 is the initial capital, 

112
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,200
i.e. the capital that 

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,160
was invested at some point. And this to 
the power of N is 

114
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,680
the time in years. 

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,220
When calculating interest, the time at the 
top 

116
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,480
of the exponent is always in years 

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,420
. This Q is our 

118
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,400
growth factor. And 

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,940
we always have to 

120
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,680
calculate this growth factor depending on 
the task. This 

121
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,580
is calculated as Q equals 1 plus 

122
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,700
P divided by 100, where P is the 

123
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,780
interest rate. Please remember that 

124
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,320
the interest rate P in this formula 

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
is really a percentage. 

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,860
In other words, if you 

127
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
have an interest rate of 5%, then enter 

128
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,620
1 plus 5 divided by 100 in this formula 
and 

129
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,440
you can then 

130
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,620
calculate your growth factor Q. 

131
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,030
We also have a small 

132
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,550
example here. Mr. Hansen invests 

133
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,390
30,000 euros in the bank at an 

134
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,350
interest rate of 7.8%, enters the 

135
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,910
functional equation of this process 

136
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,950
and calculates the capital after 6 

137
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,470
years. We know that Mr. Hansen 

138
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,510
has invested 30,000 euros in the bank or 
is 

139
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,070
investing 30,000 euros in the bank. This 

140
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,510
means that our K0 is 30,000 and we have 

141
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,130
an interest rate of 7.8%. This means 

142
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,370
that the Q is calculated as 1 plus 7.8 

143
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,070
divided by 100, which is 1.078. And 

144
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,710
we put all of this into our calculation 

145
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,170
and came up with KN. 30,000 

146
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,510
times 1.078 to the power of N. And now 

147
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,230
we are asked for the capital after 6 

148
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,630
years. This means that we 

149
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,310
simply enter the time for the N, i.e. 6, 

150
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,950
because we are supposed to 

151
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,970
calculate it after 6 years and arrive at 
30,000 times 

152
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,130
1.078 to the power of 6. And then we get 

153
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,350
47,079.71 euros. That is the capital 

154
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,950
of Mr. Hansen after six years. 

155
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,540
Now we come to the limited and 

156
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,640
logistical growth. First, 

157
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,540
let's take a look at 

158
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,080
limited growth. The general 

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,860
equation of restricted growth 

160
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,460
is b of t plus 1 equals b 

161
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,240
of t plus k times the bracket on s minus 

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,400
b of t. It is very important 

163
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,700
to remember 

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
what b of t means, what does this b 

165
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
of t plus 1 mean , what is the K and what 

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,160
is the S? Let's start with the simple 

167
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,140
things. K is a growth factor, 

168
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,080
which is constant. And 

169
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,100
this S is the limitation. The T 

170
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,520
is still our time 

171
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,220
variable. And very importantly, B 

172
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,520
of T is the stock at the time 

173
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,840
of measurement. B of T plus 1 is the 

174
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
stock after one time step. 

175
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,280
This means that if you 

176
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,660
want to calculate B of 3, then B... 

177
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,160
of 2 must be written here. This is very 
important. 

178
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,220
Of course, we have also 

179
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,100
decorated the whole thing with an example 
task 

180
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,900
, which is that 

181
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,240

182
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,220
algae grow on a pond with an area of 50 
square meters. In the first month, the 

183
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,540
area covered by algae is one 

184
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,960
square meter and in the second month 

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,780
three square meters. Determine K and the 

186
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,480
area of the covered surface in the 

187
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,810
third month. For now, we know 

188
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,190
that the pond 

189
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,750
has a size of 50 square meters. This means 
that our 

190
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,730
restriction will be 50 square meters 

191
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,750
, because if the pond only 

192
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,410
has an area of 50 square meters, only 

193
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,170
a maximum of 50 square meters can 

194
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,810
be covered by Allgäu . That is why it is 
50. 

195
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,430
Furthermore, we know b from 1, which is 

196
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,650
1 square meter. This means 

197
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,850
that at the time of observation 1 is 1 

198
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:31,170
square meter So our b of 1 

199
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,450
is 1 and we know that in the 

200
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,450
second month 3 square meters are covered. 
This 

201
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,790
means that b of 2 is 3 and 

202
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,110
we now use this to 

203
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,030
calculate the variable k. So we arrive at 
3 

204
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,790
equals 1. 1 is, as I said, the b of 

205
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,830
t or b of 1. And the k is 

206
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,810
still a variable. And that times 50 minus 

207
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,710
1. Now we just blow there, 

208
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,210
reshape it to k. So the way to calculate 

209
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,170
this would be 3 minus 1. And 

210
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,970
then divide the whole thing by 49. We 

211
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,830
then arrive at a k of 0.0408 

212
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,050
. We can then 

213
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,090

214
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,090
write down our function equation in full. 
We are still looking for the 

215
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,050
area in the third month. 

216
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,510
This means that the third month is b of 

217
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,310
2 plus 1. And I think you can 

218
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,670
already see that we now have to enter b 

219
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,070
of 2 for b of t. Plus our 

220
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,650
k, which we have calculated here, 

221
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,810
times 50 minus b of 2. and b of 2 

222
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,990
so the area covered after two 

223
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,210
months was 3, which is why there is now 

224
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,890
a 3 everywhere and so we know b 

225
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,850
of 3 is equal to 3 plus 0.0408 times 50 

226
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,790
minus 3 and that is then 4.92, which 

227
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,910
means that after three months 4.92 

228
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,970
square meters are covered with algae, 
which 

229
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,640
The other special type of growth is 

230
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,980
logistic growth. Here, too, 

231
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,920
we have B of T plus 1, B of T, K 

232
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,420
and the S. The meaning here is the 

233
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,980
same. That is, B of T plus 1 

234
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,020
is the stock after one 

235
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,420
time step. B of T is the stock 

236
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,860
at a point in time. K is the 

237
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,420
growth factor and S is again the 

238
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,600
restriction. We also have 

239
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,180
a small example of this. 

240
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,740
A company launches a new product on 

241
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,000
the market in a city with 

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,480
20,000 households. The customers 

243
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,380
naturally buy the item in line with the 

244
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,860
logistical growth and 

245
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,120
500 items are sold in the first year. in 
the . In the 

246
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,460
second year, 1,400. First, 

247
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,020
of course, we should calculate the K again 

248
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,700
and then the number in the 

249
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,680
third year. Yes, and 

250
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,920
we calculate the K again by 

251
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,300
inserting everything. We know B of T, 

252
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,760
i.e. the number of 

253
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,320
products sold in the first year, which was 

254
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,220
500. This means that B of T 

255
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,440
is 500 for us . Our threshold S is 20 

256
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,200
,000, because 

257
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,420
there won't be more than two of 

258
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,520
these products in a household. That's the 

259
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,140
assumption we make, and we 

260
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,440
also know that 

261
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,720
1400 will be sold in the second year. So 
1400 

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,280
equals 500 plus K times 500 times 20,000 

263
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,260
minus 500. We solve this equation 

264
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,720
again. Please make sure that you 

265
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
calculate minus 500 first. Then it says 

266
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,180
900 is equal to K times 500 times brackets 

267
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,080
on 20,000 minus 500 and when we 

268
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
then calculate the K, we arrive at 

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
a very small K. so 

270
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,580
please 

271
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,700
include enough decimal places at this 
point our k 

272
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,400
here is 0.0000923 

273
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,180
as an example that would only be three 

274
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,760
meaningful decimal places 

275
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,320
so it really has to 

276
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,660
be given with such a long number 

277
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,580
next we have to 

278
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,500
calculate the products sold in the third 
year 

279
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,020
that is b of 3. 

280
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,000
therefore, because we now 

281
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,300
have b of 3 here , we now use b 

282
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,040
of 2 for the b of t. that is . And that is 
1400 

283
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,540
, which is very important. We have 

284
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,000
just calculated the k. This means that we 

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,340
have b of 3 is equal to 1400 plus 0 

286
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:58,300
.0000923 times 1400 times 20,000 minus 

287
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,840
1400 

288
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,680
. If we enter this into the 

289
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,020
calculator 

290
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,560
, we arrive at 3,803. This means 

291
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
that 3,803 of the products are sold in the 
third year. 

292
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,860
That's it for the two 

293
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,640
special types of growth. 

294
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,620
Now let's move on to the 

295
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,560
logarithmic arithmetic laws and 
immediately 

296
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,680
afterwards to solving 

297
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,460
exponential equations. Let's start 

298
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,380
with the first logarithm calculation 

299
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,240
law: the logarithm of the base c 

300
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,080
of a times b is equal to the 

301
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,220
logarithm of the base c of a plus 

302
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,560
the logarithm of the base c of b 

303
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,440
. So you see, if you 

304
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,620

305
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,300
have a product inside the logarithm , you 
can solve this 

306
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,220
product by adding the two 

307
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,660
logarithms of the factors 

308
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,120
it is important that they both 

309
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,600
have the same base as both in this case 

310
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,660
the base 10 we also have 

311
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,480
an example of this the logarithm to the 

312
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,240
base 10 is equal to the logarithm 

313
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,060
to the base 10 of 4 times 10 is equal 

314
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,380
to the logarithm to the base of 4 plus 

315
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,780
the logarithm to the base 10 of 10 

316
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,140
and that is 

317
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:21,700
approximately 1 when you work it out ,602 

318
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,920
So, if you 

319
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
have a multiplication in there , it is 
simply the 

320
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,080
addition of the individual 

321
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,900
logarithms. Important, same 

322
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,880
base. The second logarithmic 

323
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,380
law is the logarithm to the 

324
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,560
base C of A divided by B, so in 

325
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,260
principle it just says divided, 

326
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,800
equals the logarithm to the base 

327
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,400
C of A minus the logarithm to the 

328
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,420
base C of B. So you see, if 

329
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,400
you divide within the logarithm, 

330
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,560
you can simply 

331
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,960
form the two individual logarithms and 

332
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,840
subtract them . 

333
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,980
Of course, we also have an example of 
this. 

334
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,380
The logarithm to the base 10 of 5, i.e. 

335
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,120
5 divided by 12, is equal to the 

336
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,440
logarithm to the base 10 of 5 minus 

337
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,400
the logarithm to the base 10 of 12. 

338
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,860
That is approximately minus 0.38. 

339
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,510
The third logarithm calculation law 

340
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,190
is the logarithm calculation law, which 

341
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,990
is usually needed. We will 

342
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,610
also need this in a moment when we 

343
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,170
calculate with exponential equations. 

344
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,790
Let me put it this way. You can 

345
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,210
't solve an exponential equation without 

346
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,070
the third law of logarithmic arithmetic. 

347
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,290
And this simply states that 

348
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,750
the logarithm to the base c of a 

349
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,050
to the power of b is equal to b times the 
logarithm 

350
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,010
to the base c of a. This means that you 

351
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,890
can simply 

352
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,190
write the exponent in front of it and 

353
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,030
multiply the logarithm by this exponent. 

354
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,110
We'll do that in a moment. 

355
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,210
Nevertheless, we have a small 

356
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,450
example here. The logarithm to the base 

357
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,910
20 of 5 to the power of 3 is nothing more 
than 

358
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,830
3 times the logarithm to the base 20 

359
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,870
of 5. Make sure that you always 

360
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,690
have the same base. And 

361
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,130
now we have 

362
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,410
learned all the tools we need to 

363
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,890
solve exponential equations. 

364
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,710
Here we see an exponential equation. 

365
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,130
An exponential equation 

366
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,810
is characterized as such by 

367
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,030
having the variable in the exponent. So 

368
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,790
the x here is in the exponent 

369
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,650
, which is actually not usual, which is 
why 

370
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,510
it is an exponential equation. And to 

371
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,590
solve the equation 

372
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,430
, or to 

373
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,850
get our variable out of the exponent 

374
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,390
, we take the logarithm and use 

375
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,530
the third logarithm arithmetic law. 

376
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,230
Because 3 to the power of x is equal to 
729 

377
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,470
, we now 

378
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,910
apply our logarithm to it. It says that 
the 

379
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,570
logarithm of 3 to the power of x is equal 

380
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,530
to the logarithm of 729. Please 

381
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,090
always apply the logarithm to both sides 

382
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,570
, otherwise you will unfortunately 

383
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,510
make a mistake. Therefore, as 

384
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,770
usual with equations, always 

385
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,250
do the same on both sides. This 

386
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,430
also applies when 

387
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,390
using the logarithm . Now we use the third 

388
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,150
law of logarithmic arithmetic. 

389
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,410
This means that the logarithm of 3 to the 
power of 

390
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,570
x is the same as x times the 

391
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,010
logarithm of 3. And that is equal 

392
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,190
to the logarithm of 729. And now 

393
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,010
we have 

394
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,290
already rearranged our exponential 
equation so that we no 

395
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,710
longer have an exponential equation. This 

396
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,070
is a completely normal equation. The 

397
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,490
logarithm of 3 is a number that 

398
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,630
the particle calculator can calculate, 

399
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,770
just like the logarithm of 729. 

400
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,850
So all we have to do now is 

401
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,390
divide by the logarithm of 3. Then 

402
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,130
it says x is equal to the logarithm 

403
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,110
of 729 divided by the logarithm of 3. 

404
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,710
And if you enter this into the 

405
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,270
calculator, it says x 

406
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,750
is equal to 6. And that solves this 

407
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,270
exponential equation. 

408
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,230
There are, of course, other 

409
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,710
cases. You can convert the 

410
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,510
exponential 

411
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,550
equation into a logarithmic equation. This 

412
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,050
simply works in the same way as we 

413
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,170
have just done. a to the power of x is 

414
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,510
equal to b, or, if we 

415
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,490
now 

416
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,770
let go of the logarithm , we can now see 
here in the 

417
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,110
next line that x is equal to the 

418
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,970
logarithm of the base a of b. 

419
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,550
In other words, if you 

420
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,270
want to save yourself this fraction here, 
where the 

421
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,230
logarithm appears twice, 

422
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,730
simply take the logarithm and take the 

423
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,330
base of the logarithm in the same way as 
the 

424
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,590
base of your exponential function 

425
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,070
. We have the base A here and 

426
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,830
therefore the logarithm also has 

427
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,610
the base A. Therefore, it 

428
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,350
no longer appears on the left-hand side, 

429
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,790
but only on the right-hand side . 

430
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,850
We can see this again here in the 

431
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,450
example just shown 3 to the power of x 

432
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,530
is equal to 729 And now we let 

433
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,810
the logarithm to base 3 go on it 

434
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,230
Then it says directly x is equal to the 

435
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,350
logarithm to base 3 of 729 The 

436
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,990
small number at the end of this log 

437
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,970
always indicates the base If there 

438
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,790
is nothing there , the logarithm has the 

439
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,130
base 10 And if we now also 

440
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,090

441
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,990
form the logarithm to base 3 of 729 , this 
is also 

442
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,430
6. 

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,680
Let's move on to an 

444
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,200
example task, a 

445
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,580
factual task, where we will also 

446
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,920
solve an exponential equation. 

447
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,800
Mrs. Huber invests 20,000 euros in 

448
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
securities at an interest rate of 3 

449
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,500
.6%. She would now like to know 

450
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,140
when she 

451
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,680
has doubled her investment. First, we 
should 

452
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,560
set up the functional equation. We 

453
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,500
know that Mrs. Huber invests 20,000 

454
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,020
euros, i.e. the K0 is 20,000 

455
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,900
and she receives an interest rate of 

456
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,660
3.6 percent. This means that the 

457
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,740
growth factor is 1 plus 3.6 divided by 

458
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,340
100, which equals 1.036. The 

459
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,240
functional equation then 

460
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,260
ends up as KN equals 20,000 times 1.036 

461
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,600
to the power of N. And Mrs. Huber would 

462
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,360
now like to know when her capital 

463
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,080
has doubled. So we set the 

464
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,020
functional equation equal to twice 

465
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,340
the starting capital. This means that 

466
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,100
40,000 is equal to 20,000 times 1.036 

467
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,840
to the power of n. 

468
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,860
We now want to solve this exponential 
equation . First 

469
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,660
you should always 

470
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,160
isolate the exponential part , so we 
divide by 

471
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,900
20,000. 40,000 divided by 20,000 is then 

472
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,520
2 and that is equal to 1.036 to the power 
of 

473
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,100
n. Now we let 

474
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,900
go of the logarithm again , in this case 

475
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,080
the logarithm to the base 1.036 

476
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,660
and then it says n is equal to the 

477
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,860
logarithm to the base 1.036 of 2. 

478
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,760
You then enter this into the 

479
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
calculator. It is then 

480
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,000
really important to 

481
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,620
adjust the base logarithm and then the 
result is n 

482
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,040
is about 20, which means that 

483
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,640
Mrs. Huber's capital has 

484
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,520
doubled after about 20 years. 

485
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,830
We are now at the end of the webinar. 

486
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,290
Thank you very much for 

487
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,250
your attention and I hope that 

488
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,890
you 

489
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,270
were able to take something away from the 
webinar .
