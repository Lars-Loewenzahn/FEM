My name is Joshua and I am a 

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,210
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,370
Welcome to the second video 

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,990
on orbitals. If you 

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,450
haven 

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,810
't seen the video on the basics of 
orbitals yet , please take 

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,230
a look at our online 

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,770
 learning center. Let's 

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,210
briefly  review the basics of 

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,530
orbitals. Firstly, orbitals 

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,190
indicate where an electron is 90% 

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,030
likely to be located. 2) There 

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,110
are six different orbitals 

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,670
, distributed over different 

15
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,390
principal quantum numbers, with S, P and 

16
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,550
D orbitals being the most commonly used 

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,850
orbital forms. 3) Each of these 

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,410
orbitals contains 

19
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,870
a maximum of two electrons. 4. 

20
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,790
if you 

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,930
write out all the occupied orbitals , you 
get the 

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,570
electron configuration. The first 

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,390
example we will look at today 

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,730
is the element sulphur. Sulphur 

25
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,710
has 16 electrons, which are 

26
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,070

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,390

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,010
distributed over different orbitals with 
different principal quantum numbers. To 
find out what 

29
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,610
this distribution looks like, it is 

30
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,170
helpful to 

31
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,910
proceed according to the following scheme. 
1. note the individual 

32
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,330
principal quantum numbers and the 

33
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,270
orbitals present there. 2. now 

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,070
assign the orbital electrons. 

35
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,250
Whenever an orbital is fully occupied, 

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,690
you move on to the next one. 

37
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,790
Accordingly, 1s receives 2 electrons, 

38
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,910
2s also, all 3p orbitals are occupied with 

39
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,090
2 electrons each, 3s receives 2 

40
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,970
electrons, with 3p a 

41
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,150
special feature now comes to light. 

42
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,270
There are still 4 electrons to be 
distributed, but 

43
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,630
instead of 

44
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,850
occupying 2p orbitals completely , all 3 
are formed so that 

45
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,190
there are 2p orbitals with 

46
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,770
one electron each and a p 

47
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,410
 orbital with 2 

48
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,090
. 

49
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,530
For sulphur it is 1s with a 

50
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,570
superscript 2, 2s also with 

51
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,350
a superscript 2, 2p with a 

52
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,850
superscript 6, 3s again with a 

53
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,850
superscript 2 and 3p, attention, 

54
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,450
this time with a superscript 4. 

55
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,790
But why are the 3p orbitals 

56
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,350
occupied in this way ? As the electrons in 
the 

57
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,190
outermost shell, they are used to 

58
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,810

59
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,190
form bonds with other atoms . However, 
this is only possible if 

60
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,050
the orbitals are not fully occupied. 

61
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,230
There is also a helpful 

62
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,790
notation for this , namely the 

63
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,510
energy level scheme. 

64
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,730
The 1s orbital has the lowest energy 
level. 

65
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,790
The two arrows within the 

66
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,070
orbital box represent the electrons 

67
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,670
. This is followed by the 2s orbital. Then 

68
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,610
the 2p 

69
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,990
orbitals , which are also fully occupied , 
of which there 

70
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,050
are  three. Then the 3s orbital and 

71
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,590
finally the 3p orbitals, of which 

72
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,710
one is fully occupied and two 

73
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,390
are single occupied. 

74
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,110
There is another special feature of 
manganese 

75
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,010
. Here the 

76
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,350
electron configuration is 1s with the 

77
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,030
superscript 2, 2s with the 

78
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,830
superscript 2 2p with the superscript 

79
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,290
6, 3s with the 

80
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,730
superscript 2, 3p again with a 

81
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,230
superscript 6, 4s with the 

82
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,190
superscript 2 and 3d with the 

83
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,390
superscript 5. But why is 

84
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,610
the 4th s orbital in front of the 3rd d 
orbital? 

85
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,650
This is because in 

86
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,070
the principal quantum number orbital 
scheme you do not 

87
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,230
work through the rows, but 

88
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,630

89
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,530
proceed according to the diagonals marked 
by the arrows . Alternatively 

90
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,610
, there is the checkerboard approach. 

91
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,570
It is based on the 

92
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,650
energy level scheme. It is 

93
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,750

94
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,730
read row by row from bottom to top and 
from left to right. Using 

95
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,430
manganese as an example, I would 

96
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,710
also like to show you the abbreviated 
notation 

97
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,570
. It 

98
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,790
always refers to the previous noble gas, 
as 

99
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,270
there are only fully occupied 

100
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,450
orbitals and only the 

101
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,030
additional orbitals are added. Here 

102
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,650
you can see the electron configuration 

103
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,550
of manganese. The previous noble gas is 

104
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,250
argon, which covers these orbitals. 

105
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,290
The abbreviated electron configuration 

106
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,490
is therefore AR4S2 

107
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,510
and 3D5. In conclusion, let us 

108
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,490
summarize once again . Firstly, when 

109
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,930
assigning the orbitals 

110
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,930
, it should be noted that all orbitals 

111
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,830
of one type are formed first before 

112
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,590
they are assigned twice and that 

113
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,690
one does not 

114
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,850
proceed strictly according to principal 
quantum numbers. Secondly, 

115
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,770
the energy level 

116
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,690
as well as the principal quantum number 

117
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,610
orbital scheme and the checkerboard help 
here 

118
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,110
. Thirdly 

119
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,130
, there is a 

120
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,830
shorthand notation for the electron 
configuration in which one part is 

121
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,310
replaced by the element symbol of the 

122
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,370
previous noble gas. 

123
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,030
I hope that you 

124
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,930
now have a better understanding of 
orbitals . If you have any further 

125
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,690
