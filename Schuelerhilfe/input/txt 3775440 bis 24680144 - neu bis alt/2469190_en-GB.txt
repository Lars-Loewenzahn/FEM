00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,620
Hi Max, if you 

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,640
can hear me , I would 

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,740
ask you to 

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,440
write into the chat. Hi 

5
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,550
Max, I'll try again. If you 

6
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,210
can hear me, I would 

7
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,570
ask you to just 

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,330
write into the chat. 

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,160
Something will definitely come up. 

10
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,450
I didn't 

11
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,870
actually say anything just now. I've only 
ever 

12
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,710
observed how you 

13
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,590
've come in and out of the room again and 
again, 

14
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,690
but then it's fine if you 

15
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,910
can hear me, I hope that 

16
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,090
everything is working out for you now 

17
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,830
if you 

18
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,850
should be kicked out again at some point, 
that's 

19
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,330
no problem at all , then try to 

20
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,450
connect again directly, I'll 

21
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,850
just interrupt at that point 

22
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,790
and then wait until you 

23
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,650
're back for the webinar, if you 

24
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,330
have any questions about 

25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,250
any content, you can 

26
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,430
just 

27
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,310
write them directly into the chat here 
I'll see that and then 

28
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,970
we'll try to 

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,050
clarify it directly on the spot . All 

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,800
right, then we'll start straight away. 
What 

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,700
exactly are we going to cover in the 
webinar 

32
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,520
? 

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,820
Multiplication, factoring, 

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,800
calculating with fraction equations and 

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,600
transforming formulas in relation to 

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,310
algebra. Let's start with 

37
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,810
multiplication. There are 

38
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,450
important rules in mathematics. 

39
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,610
One of the most important basic rules is 

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,670
bracket before dot before dash 

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,670
calculation. Here you can see the 

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,590
equation 3 times in brackets 4 minus 2 

43
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,330
plus 1. And we have to 

44
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,310
solve the whole thing first. So 

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,250
here we apply the rule parentheses before 
dot before 

46
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,830
dash. 

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, 

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,960
do you happen to see it now? 

49
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,020
Actually, the slide should 

50
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,940
be recognizable. 

51
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,090
All right, then try it again 

52
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,450
. 

53
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,490
But 

54
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,280
think... 

55
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,940
So, can you see the slide now? 

56
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:56,150
So, the first equation 

57
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,390
above. 3 times in brackets 4 minus 2 

58
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,010
plus 1. So we 

59
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,790
apply the brackets from point to dash and 
work 

60
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,050
out the brackets first. 4 minus 2 

61
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,790
equals 2. Now we can apply the dot 

62
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,910
before dash rule. 3 

63
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,370
times 2 equals 6 and now we 

64
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,990
just add the 1 to get 

65
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,670
7. Multiplying out is 

66
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,670
an alternative method for 

67
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,510
solving such brackets. 

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,370
Here, for example, we have 

69
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,070
the same equation as 

70
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,990
before and 

71
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,050
are now just multiplying the whole thing 
out. This means that we 

72
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,490
multiply 3 by 4 once, 

73
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,150
just like 3 or in this case even 

74
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,230
minus 3 times 2. So we calculate 3 times 

75
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,390
4, get 12, minus 3 times 2, minus 

76
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,530
6 and now add and subtract 

77
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,670
the numbers to get 

78
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,510
the result 7. We 

79
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,240

80
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,700
cannot calculate or summarize x-2 in the 
equation above 

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,460
, as x is an unknown. What we 

82
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,980
can do now, however, is 

83
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,260
multiply it out and 

84
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,560
summarize it as far as possible. 

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,820
So we 

86
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,460
multiply out again and get the 

87
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:29,000
equation 3x-3x2-1. 3 times x remains 

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,280
3x, minus 3 times 2 becomes minus 6 

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,280
and plus 1. 3x minus 5 is then 

90
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,040
our final form. We have 

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,380
now created a relatively compact result. 
Here are two 

93
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,220
more examples, namely minus 2 

94
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,060
times in brackets 3x plus y minus 5. 

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,540
Here we now have two unknowns 

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,220
, but that's actually... no 

97
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,740
problem. So we solve, minus 2 

98
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,140
times 3x minus 2y minus 2 times minus 5 

99
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,200
and we get the final form 

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,460
minus 6x minus 2y plus 10. Just 

101
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,320

102
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,420
apply exactly the same thing again at the 
bottom , where we no 

103
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,640
longer have only 2 unknowns, but 3, 

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
but here too we simply 

105
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,180
multiply out and 

106
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,880
add the variables together. 5x times 4y 

107
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,620
becomes 20xy, 5x minus z becomes minus 5xz 

108
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,960
and 5x plus 1, 5x times 1 becomes 

109
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,660
5x. 

110
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,570
Now let's move on to factoring. 

111
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,250
In principle, factoring out is the 

112
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,550
opposite of multiplying out. 

113
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,490
So if we 

114
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,510
have the longer form 3 times 4 minus 3 
times 2, 

115
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,150
we factor out the 3 here and 

116
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,750
have 3 times in brackets 4 minus 2. 

117
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,730
The prerequisite for this is that the 

118
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,390
two 

119
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,870
terms are a 

120
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,390
sum or the difference of 

121
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,170
products or that all products 

122
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,070
have a common factor, 

123
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,230
such as the 3 in the 

124
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,030
upper equation. If we now 

125
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,170

126
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,770
look at the lower equation , we want to 
find the 

127
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,570
common factor everywhere. 

128
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,030
That would be 2 in this case, so we 
calculate 

129
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,490
4 times 2 minus 2 times 3 plus 2 times 2, 

130
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,130
now factor out the 2 and 

131
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,310
only get 4 minus 3 

132
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,650
plus 2 times 2 in the brackets . Here is 
the whole thing 

133
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,870
again with variables. 3x minus 6 

134
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,370
could be resolved to 3 times x 

135
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,270
minus 3 times 2. So in 

136
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,510
the bracketed out version we get 3 times 

137
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,470
brackets on x minus 2. In the 

138
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,950
equation below it looks like this. 6x 

139
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,570
plus xy minus 5xz. The common 

140
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,630
component or common factor 

141
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,450
in this case is x. 

142
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,150
So we have x times, brackets open, 6 plus 
y 

143
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,690
minus 5z. 

144
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,710
Let's move on to the fractional equations. 

145
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,870
The example for this is a previously 

146
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,290
known equation, namely 3x plus 1 

147
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,270
half is equal to minus 4x². plus x 

148
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,270
thirds. The equation contains 

149
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,290
fractions, but is therefore not a fraction 

150
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,410
equation. 

151
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,670
For example, consider an x-tel is 

152
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,810
equal to 0.25. The variable to 

153
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,530
be solved for is 

154
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,310
in the denominator at least once. This is 
the x here. It 

155
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,570
cannot 

156
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,290
be eliminated by truncation . As a 
counterexample 

157
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,090
2x, x-tel would be 2 ones, because we 

158
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,930
can delete the x here. 

159
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,990
As a result, we only have 2 ones 

160
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,790
and that would be 2. We 

161
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,750
can now 

162
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,730
make several considerations, 

163
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,430
such as by which numbers 

164
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,030
the 1 must be divided to 

165
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,090
get 0.25 . We can convert 0.25 into a 

166
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,310
fraction and we get 

167
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,410
1 x is equal to 1 quarter. 

168
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,650

169
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,950
In principle, this would be equivalent 
conversion. 1 x 

170
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,450
is nothing other than 

171
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,830
1 divided by x. The counter calculation to 
this is 

172
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,450
the multiplication of x. 

173
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,490
So let's take a look at the equation 

174
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,010
below to find x. 1 x 

175
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,670
is equal to 0.25. 

176
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,710
So we multiply times x to 

177
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,250
get the x from the left side to the right 
side and 

178
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,850
get the equation 1 is 

179
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,590
equal to 0.25 times x, divide 

180
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,830
by 0.25 on both sides and 

181
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,650
get 4 is equal to x. 

182
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,850
What do we have to do with several 

183
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,790
fractions with terms with x in the 
denominator? 

184
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,270
Well, we first have to 

185
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,710
determine a main denominator, 

186
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,650
multiply the equation by the main 
denominator, 

187
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,590
reduce and summarize and solve the 

188
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,690
resulting equation again using the 

189
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,090
usual methods as before. 

190
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,770
So we first determine the 

191
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,990
main denominator. All denominators must 

192
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,590
be multiplied together and 

193
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,610
we have to 

194
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,650
put brackets around the terms. The main 
denominator is therefore 

195
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,810
equal to x times x in brackets plus 1. 

196
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,070
Now we want to 

197
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,370
multiply the equation by the main 
denominator. One xth 

198
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,270
is equal to 2x and in the denominator x 
plus 1. 

199
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,630
We now multiply x times x 

200
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,250
and times the parenthesis x plus 1. 

201
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,490
This gives us the following 

202
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,010
equation, 1 times x times in parentheses x 

203
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,850
plus 1 by x, and 2x times x times in 

204
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,530
parentheses x plus 1 and in the 
denominator 

205
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,750
again x plus 1. We now reduce 

206
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,930
and summarize. On the left-hand 

207
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,010
side, we delete the x in the numerator 

208
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,590
and in the brackets. On 

209
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,770
the right-hand side, x plus 1 in 

210
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,410
brackets and x plus 1 in the denominator. 

211
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,630
We then get the following equation. 

212
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,970
1 times x plus 1 in brackets equals 

213
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,710
2x times x. We apply the 

214
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,090
calculation formulas and now get 

215
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,350
x plus 1 equals 

216
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,670
2x squared on the left-hand side . What we 
do now, we 

217
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,070
We drag the 2x² 

218
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,870
over to the left side so that we 

219
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,870
have a 0 on the right side and 

220
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,050
get the final formula minus 2x² 

221
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,810
plus x plus 1 equals 0. With the formula, 

222
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,010
we can now 

223
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,630
also apply the pq formula and get 

224
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,430
the solution set x equals 1, x1 

225
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,570
equals 1 and x2 would be minus 1.5. The 

226
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,530
whole thing again in the summation 
bracket. 

227
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,110
shown with minus 1.5 and 1. 

228
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,140
Let us now turn to the transformation of 

229
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,060
formulas. Formulas generally make things 
easier for us. 

230
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,380
.. 

231
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,100
Yes, go ahead. 

232
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,010
I think... So you mean the 

233
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,190
reciprocal in 

234
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,930
this case? 

235
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,250
Well, no, you would 

236
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,370
form the reciprocal on the right-hand 
side, but 

237
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,330
with x divided by 1... And 

238
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,910
so I can definitely see what you 

239
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,870
want to do with it. And it would 

240
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,870
even work out mathematically 

241
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,360
in this case. 

242
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,520
But I 

243
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,680
don't think that would be the case with 
more complex numbers later on. That's why 

244
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:19,250
I would rather use the main denominator 

245
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,910
to determine this. That's 

246
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,330
a bit more writing, but 

247
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,330
it also teaches 

248
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,750
you how to shorten away. 

249
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,430

250
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,270
I'm 

251
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,910
not personally familiar with this rule of 
reversing the numerator and denominator 

252
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,230
, so it's definitely safer 

253
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,990
, but I don't know 

254
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,010
who you heard this from or whether your 

255
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,970
teacher explained it to you, 

256
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,330
but I would rather 

257
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,850

258
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,570

259
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,350

260
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,490
continue with the tried and tested 
methods, as I said, I would simply 
continue with the tried and tested methods 
. You're definitely 

261
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,770
on the safe side. And with 

262
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,990
a quick trick like that, you 

263
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,590
can sometimes quickly fall into a trap 

264
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,470
. That's why, as 

265
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,190
I said , I would simply do what I did here 
with 

266
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,270
determining the main denominator . Well, 

267
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,010
then I would continue with the 

268
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,590
transformation of formulas. Formulas 

269
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,370
generally make it easier for us to 

270
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,430
calculate and convert quantities 

271
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,390
and other values. 

272
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,110
For example, how do you convert 
centimetres and meters 

273
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,450
or how do you calculate 

274
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,490
the 

275
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,870
speed from a distance and a duration ? But 
what is really 

276
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,870
interesting is that we are now coming 

277
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,470

278
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,490
back to the percentage formulas . In the 

279
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:29,330
formula , we have W equals large G divided 
by 100 times 

280
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,470
P. We have three variables here. 

281
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,830
We have the percentage value, we have the 

282
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,270
basic value and the percentage. 

283
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,710
Just a quick 

284
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,790
explanation. The basic value here is 

285
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,050
, for example, the initial value of 

286
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,150
a product, e.g. 

287
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,710
a pair of shoes that costs 120 euros. 

288
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,930
The 100 is used here to divide the 

289
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,810
percentage. Small p, the 

290
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,910
percentage, is, for example, the 

291
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,770
discount you 

292
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,330
would now get on these shoes. And W would 
then be the 

293
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,250
amount you would 

294
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,880
have to pay 

295
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,060
after deducting the percentage. 

296
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,660
So in principle, you 

297
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,140
only have to enter the values for G and P 
and 

298
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,320
then you get the value of large W. W. 

299
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,740
But what happens, for example, 

300
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,720
if you know W and P and are looking for G 

301
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,200
or if you know W and large G and 

302
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,820
are looking for small P? Further formulas 
would 

303
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,560
then be necessary, which you 

304
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,080
would have to memorize, or what you 

305
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,780
can do is 

306
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,820
simply reshape them. The advantage is 
simply 

307
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,280
that you 

308
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,460
only have to memorize one formula. But 

309
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,260
then again, you also need to 

310
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,540
have the necessary knowledge to 

311
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,840
convert such things. 

312
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,120
So now we convert to capital G. We 

313
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,280
multiply our formula by 100 

314
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,740
and thus obtain 

315
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,240
large W times 100 on the left-hand side 
and the 100 from 

316
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,760
the denominator disappears so that we 

317
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,600
only 

318
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,300
have large G times small p on the 
right-hand side . We 

319
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,360
now divide the right and left sides by p 
and 

320
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,820
obtain for large g the same 

321
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,100
percentage value times 100, divided by the 

322
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,600
percentage. If we now want to 

323
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,980

324
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,280
convert to small p, i.e. to the 
percentage, we first multiply 

325
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,780
by 100 again and basically have 

326
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,440
the same framework as before 

327
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,680
, but now divide by 

328
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,620
the large p and get 

329
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,600
the formula percentage value 

330
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,020
times 100 divided by the 

331
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,820
basic value for the percentage. We have 
another 

332
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,220
formula here and now we have the 

333
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,200
volume formula of a square 

334
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,980
pyramid. So we have the 

335
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,500
volume, which 

336
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,260
is equal to one third times a² times the 
height of the pyramid. 

337
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,040
We have now found the values for a and v, 

338
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,300
for example, 

339
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,600
but now it is h. So we also 

340
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,880
convert again. We calculate the formula 
with 

341
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,980
times 3 thirds. By doing this, we 

342
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,560

343
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,900
cancel the 1 third on the right side of 
the equals sign and get 3 

344
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,200
whole times the volume is equal to a 

345
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,460
squared times h. We now divide 

346
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,420
by a squared and get 

347
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,340
the formula h is equal to 3 times the 

348
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,340
volume divided by a squared. Now 

349
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,260
you could insert values for A and V 

350
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,480
and 

351
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,700
determine the height directly. Do you have 
any 

352
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,520
questions about the last two slides? 

353
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,020
Or about anything that 

354
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,820
was presented here in the webinar? 

355
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,700
Okay, great, that definitely makes me 
happy 

356
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,100
. Then thank you for 

357
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,480

358
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,420
tuning in this evening and for 

359
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,700
listening to the exams
