00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,610
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,750
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,790
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain to you 

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,690

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,390
what Mendel's rule of inheritance is all 
about in biology 

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,650
. In addition to this video, 

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,990
you can 

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,470
 also find a wiki 

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,410
on this topic in our online learning 
center, where 

10
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,710
the most important terms and 

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,110
basics are explained. In everyday life, 

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,610
you usually only come 

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,110
into contact with the rules of inheritance 
indirectly. Tact. 

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,070
In the case of animals and plants, we talk 
about 

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,730
breeds or breeding and 

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,550
in the case of us humans, we 

17
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,770

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,090

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,230
more or 

20
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,770
less 

21
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,590
allude to Mendel's rules with remarks such 
as, "You're the spitting image of your 
mother" or " You inherited that from your 
father". 

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,330
A good knowledge of 

23
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,570
Mendel's rules is extremely important when 
breeding new animal breeds , as 

24
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,430
they explain how certain traits 

25
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,130
are inherited. The rules are named 

26
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,310
after this gentleman. Gregor 

27
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,510
Mendel Mendel was a monk in the 19th 
century 

28
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,190
and carried out extensive 

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,230
experiments on the inheritance process of 

30
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,270
external traits in peas. 

31
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,070
However, before I 

32
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,750
go into the actual rules, here are some 

33
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,790
important terms. 1. gene The gene is 

34
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,550
the 

35
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,970
hereditary trait responsible for the 
expression of the trait . In all 

36
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,670
organisms that have a double 

37
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,250
set of chromosomes 

38
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,330
, all genes are also present in duplicate 

39
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,130
. All genes of an organism 

40
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,690
are called genome. Secondly, allele. This 
is 

41
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,550
the gene variant that determines the 
expression of 

42
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,490
a trait. A 

43
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,430
diploid organism always has two 

44
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,110
genes for one trait. One from the 

45
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,310
mother and one from the father. The 

46
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,150
two forms can 

47
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,390

48
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,850

49
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,750
carry either the same or different 
information regarding a trait , e.g. black 
and brown 

50
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,570
coat color. The information is then 

51
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,010

52
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,970

53
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,470
stored at a specific location on the 
chromosome, the gene locus . 3. 
homozygous. 

54
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,050
This means that both alleles of the 

55
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,830
genotype are the same. This is also called 

56
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,370
homozygous. Heterozygous, 

57
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,150
heterozygous. The alleles of the genotypes 

58
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,330
differ. Dominant, the 

59
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,950
characteristic of this allele 

60
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,090
prevails. It therefore 

61
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,190
determines the trait. This is indicated by 

62
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,870
a capital letter. 

63
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,430
Recessive, the trait of this allele 

64
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,970
cannot assert itself if it 

65
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,850

66
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,370
occurs together with a dominant allele . 
It is also called 

67
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,810
trait inferior. This is represented by 

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,510
a small letter. 

69
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,390
The parent generation, also known as the 

70
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,010
parental generation, bears the 
abbreviation 

71
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,870
P. These are the parent organisms. 

72
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,270
The daughter generation or 

73
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,710
filial generation bears the abbreviation 
F. 

74
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,190
These are the offspring. 

75
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,630
It is also important to distinguish 
between the 

76
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,590
terms genotype and phenotype. 

77
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,210
Genotype refers to the 

78
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,990
combination of alleles, phenotype to the 
external 

79
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,550
appearance of an organism. 

80
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,690
For example, we then have a 

81
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,710
large A, a small A, which results in 

82
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,130
brown eyes, a large A and another 

83
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,190
large A, which also results in 

84
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,910
brown eyes, but a small A and 

85
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,470
another small A results in blue 

86
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,470
eyes. Now that the conceptual 

87
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,070
basics have been clarified, we come 

88
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,170
to Mendel's first rule, the 

89
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,030
uniformity rule. It states that 

90
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,750
when two organisms 

91
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
with different 

92
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,570
homozygous traits are crossed , all 

93
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,610
organisms of the first 

94
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,910
daughter generation F1 

95
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,810
look the same, i.e. uniform. Even if 

96
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,270
they are now heterozygous. To 

97
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,710
illustrate this, you can see a 

98
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,190
combination square here. One parent 

99
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,730
has the genes large B, large B 

100
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,790
and the other the genes small G and 

101
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,570
small G. Each parent inherits 

102
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,930
only one gene at a time. 

103
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,750
The result is always the combination large 
B, 

104
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,050
small G. Here B stands for blue and 

105
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,250
G for green. The blue alleles are 

106
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,310
dominant and the green alleles are 
recessive. 

107
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,190
This means that all organisms of the 

108
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,830
daughter generation are blue. The second 

109
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,130
Mendelian rule, the splitting rule, 

110
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,770
deals with what happens 

111
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,050
when you 

112
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,590

113
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,910
cross members of the first daughter 
generation, i.e. the F1 generation. It is 
called the 

114
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,010
splitting rule because both 

115
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,490
characteristics of the parent generation 

116
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,010
can now occur again. Transcription. Here 

117
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,010
is another combination square. 

118
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,590
This time either a 

119
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,270
large B or a small G is inherited. 

120
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,150
The combinations 

121
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,050
large B, large B, large B, small 

122
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,030
G and large B, small G as well as 

123
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,650
small G, small G are formed. The optical 

124
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,570
result shows that there are now both 

125
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,390
blue and green organisms. 

126
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,810
The ratio between blue and green 

127
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,670
is 3 to 1. The third Mendelian 

128
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,550
rule is the independence rule, 

129
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,670
also known as the recombination rule. 

130
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,610
In this rule, 

131
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,170
two independent characteristics are 

132
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,570
considered simultaneously . The parent 
generation is 

133
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,770
again homozygous. In the second 

134
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,670
generation, 

135
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,190
however, the result is individuals with 
new 

136
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,150
combinations. The 

137
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,050
combination square shows that 

138
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,810
a large R or a small 

139
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,030
Q has been added in each case. R is 
dominant 

140
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,310
and stands for round, Q is recessive 

141
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,310
and stands for square. All 

142
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,370
organisms of the first 

143
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,470
daughter generation are both blue 

144
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,230
and round. If you now cross 

145
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,970
members of this generation, you 

146
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,430
get the following combination. 

147
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,150
Nine different 

148
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,430
combinations are formed . In the second 

149
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,690
daughter generation, there are now four 

150
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,910
optical types. Blue-round, green-round, 

151
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,350
blue-square and 

152
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,610
 green-square. They 

153
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,910

154
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,170
occur in a ratio of 9 to 3 to 3 to 1. This 
ratio 

155
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,030
applies to the phenotypic occurrence. 

156
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,210
In the genotype, the 

157
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,270
ratio differs 

158
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,550
fundamentally once again. Finally, 

159
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,550
an overview of all three rules. 

160
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,870
Firstly the uniformity rule, 

161
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,050
secondly the splitting rule and thirdly 

162
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,430
the independence rule. I hope 

163
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,990
I have been able to help you 

164
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,430
understand Mendel's rules of inheritance 

165
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,210
. See you next time.
