00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,850
Welcome to a new learning video. 

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,830
My name is Joshua and I am a 

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,510
tutor at Schülerhilfe. 

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,590
I'm pleased to explain the topic of 

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,210
catalysis to you today. In addition to 

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,630
this video, you can 

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,590
also find a 

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,190
wiki on this topic in our online learning 
center, 

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,990
where the most important terms 

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,130
and basics are explained. 

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,650
You 

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,130
may have already heard the term catalytic 
converter in connection with 

13
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,110
vehicles and their 

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,870
pollutant emissions 

15
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,150
. This ensures that 

16
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,150
pollutants are quickly converted 

17
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,530
into non-toxic substances, which are then 

18
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,230
released through the exhaust. 

19
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,230
What exactly catalysis is and how 

20
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,710
it works is 

21
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,390
explained below. 

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,230
Reaction energy plays an 

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,550
important role in reactions. Reaction 
energy 

24
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,250
is the energy that 

25
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,050

26
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,010
is expended or released when a reaction 
takes place. If energy is 

27
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,330
released during a reaction, 

28
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,770
this is because the products of the 

29
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,050
reaction have a lower energy than 

30
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,330
the reactants. The difference 

31
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,810
between their energies, the 

32
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,630
reaction energy, is 

33
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,450

34
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,990
released into the environment in the form 
of heat and light, for example. The 
reaction is 

35
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,530
exothermic. An energy-consuming 

36
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,450
reaction is called endothermic. 

37
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,490
Let us now look at the 

38
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,110

39
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,790
combustion of magnesium to 

40
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,830
magnesium oxide that is often shown in 
chemistry lessons. The magnesium strip is 

41
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,750

42
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,850
held in the flame of the Bunsen burner and 
begins to 

43
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,530

44
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,190
oxidize to the product under a bright 
flame , exothermic reaction. But what 

45
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,650
if the product is energetically 

46
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,430
more favorable than the reactants, the 

47
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,770
starting materials of the reaction, 
magnesium 

48
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,550
and oxygen? Why 

49
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,010
doesn't the strip 

50
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,250
already react to form the product without 
our intervention? This is due 

51
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,410
to the 

52
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,230
activation energy required to 

53
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,970

54
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,350
get the reaction going . 

55
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,410
The Bunsen burner supplies this energy in 
the form of 

56
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,450
heat. It is quite high and 

57
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,270
prevents spontaneous oxidation 

58
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,750
of the strip. For many biological 

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,790
processes and also for us living beings 

60
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,470
, overcoming such a 

61
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,890
high activation energy would be 

62
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,110
problematic, as we 

63
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,930

64
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,930
are also dependent on burning sugars and 
fats to generate energy. 

65
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,490
This is where catalysis comes into play. 

66
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,510
It 

67
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,290
greatly reduces the activation energy and 
thus accelerates the 

68
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,370
reaction. 

69
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,610
Catalysis is achieved by so-called 

70
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,830
catalysts, chemical substances that 

71
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,490
are involved in the reaction but 

72
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,990
emerge from it unchanged. 

73
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,670
The mode of action of catalysts 

74
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,070
is based on the formation of an 

75
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,070
energetically stable intermediate stage 

76
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,610
and its reaction to the 

77
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,410
end product. In the diagram 

78
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,990
you can see the reaction of the 
hypothetical 

79
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,490
reactants A and B to the product AB 

80
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,950
. Without a catalyst 

81
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,690
, this reaction proceeds via an 

82
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,010
energetically unfavorable 

83
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,650
intermediate state. To achieve this, 

84
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,270
a high activation energy is 

85
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,370
required . However, if a 

86
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,290
catalyst is used, it forms 

87
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,310
the relatively stable 

88
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,730
intermediate AK with reactant A , which 

89
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,550
quickly 

90
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,150
reacts with B to form the end product due 
to its changed properties , while 

91
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,410
the catalyst K 

92
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,970
leaves the reaction unchanged. It should 
be noted 

93
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,730
that catalysts 

94
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,410
do not change the chemical equilibrium, 
they 

95
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,530
merely intervene in the kinetics, 

96
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,290
i.e. accelerate the reaction. The 

97
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,690
thermodynamics remain 

98
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,070
unaffected by the catalysts. Well-known 

99
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,850
technical catalysts are the 

100
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,530
precious metals platinum, rhodium and 

101
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,350
palladium, which 

102
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,450
accelerate combustion, among other things. 

103
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,630

104
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,630
Catalysts are 

105
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,070
used in over 80% of chemical-industrial 
processes. In addition to positive 

106
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,490
catalysts, 

107
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,550
which reduce the activation energy and 

108
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,170
accelerate the reaction, there are 

109
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,270
also negative catalysts, 

110
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,450
which increase the activation energy and 

111
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,010
thus slow down the reaction. These 

112
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,130
negative catalysts 

113
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,550
are also used in industry, for 

114
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,730
example when naturally 

115
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,930
explosive reactions 

116
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,230
need to be controlled. 

117
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,130

118
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,530
Biological catalysts are even more 
relevant for us. These 

119
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,690
biocatalysts 

120
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,510
are called enzymes . They are found in the 
cells of 

121
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,650
all living organisms, as almost all 

122
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,970
vital chemical 

123
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,890
reactions are catalyzed. 

124
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,270
Enzymes play a fundamental 

125
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,270
role in metabolism, from digestion 

126
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,130
to reproduction and 

127
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,610
gene transcription . Enzymes are usually 

128
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,970
complex proteins that 

129
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,970
bind specifically to the reactants, bring 
them into 

130
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,630
close proximity to each other 

131
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,370
and 

132
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,790

133
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,190

134
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,830
stabilize potentially unfavourable 
intermediates through intermolecular 
interactions . 

135
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,930
It is the mode of action of enzymes that 
allows the emergence 

136
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,010
of complex life as we 

137
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,190
know it today. Thank you for your 

138
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,090
attention. I hope the video 

139
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,330

140
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,490
understand the topic of 

141
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,130
reaction energy and catalysis 

142
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,410
.
