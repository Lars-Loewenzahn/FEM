00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,170
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,370
Basic Concepts of Geometry. 

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,050
In this webinar , we will 

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,490

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,090
talk about the basic concepts of geometry 
. On the one hand, that's the 

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,510
point, we'll start with that, which is 

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,550
a very basic one. And then 

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,850
we'll look at straight lines, 

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,610
distances, angles and circles. 

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,010
Let's start with the point. A 

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,690
point is the most important element in 

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,370
geometry. You can use a point to 

13
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,610
define corner points and 

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,630
everything else. Furthermore 

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,850
, points are also 

16
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,070
indispensable in a coordinate system. 

17
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,630
You mark such a point with a small 

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,330
cross . The cross should 

19
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,610
of course 

20
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,910
be drawn as thinly as possible. And the 

21
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,630
actual point is 

22
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,470
not in the area, but the 

23
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,930
point is really at the 

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,590
intersection of these small 

25
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,210
lines here. So that's where the 

26
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,310
actual point is . And so that you 

27
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,350

28
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,370
can find the point again on your sheet , 
you make a 

29
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,510
little cross around it. So 

30
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,670
please make sure that you 

31
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,090
do this as precisely as possible, simply 
so that 

32
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,130
it is nice and accurate. This is also 

33
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,070
something very important in 

34
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,990
geometry. It should always be as precise 
as possible 

35
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,210
, so always use a 

36
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,830
nice sharp pencil. 

37
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,930
That brings us to 

38
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,330
straight lines and distances. What is the 

39
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,550

40
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,590
difference between them? If we 

41
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,350
draw two points and connect them with a 

42
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,790
line, this line is 

43
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,810
a straight line. This is because a 
straight line is 

44
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,450
not limited by the points. A 

45
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,990
straight line has the property that 

46
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,350
it is infinitely long. This means 

47
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,350
that a straight line has no beginning and 
no 

48
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,690
end. It does not start at one of the 

49
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,330
two points and end at the other. 

50
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,280
It is infinitely long. This is 

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,220
the big difference to a 

52
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,100
line. A line is a 

53
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,580
direct connection between two 

54
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,180
points and a line starts at 

55
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,920
one point and ends at another 

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,400
. 

57
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
is simply infinitely long and 

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,120
contains both points. That is a big 

59
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,460
difference. Therefore, a line is 

60
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,600
always just the direct 

61
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,120
connection between two points and the 

62
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,200
straight line is infinitely long, the 

63
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,920
line is not. There is also 

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,320
the so-called ray. The beam 

65
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,880
starts at a point and is then 

66
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,140
infinitely long, such as the 

67
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,960
laser beam of a laser pointer. It 

68
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,140
starts in the laser. And is then 

69
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,200
straight, if you like, 

70
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,940
infinitely long. This brings us 

71
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,980
to angles. Angles are 

72
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,360
always 

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,960
enclosed between intersecting degrees. In 
other words, we 

74
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,220
see two 

75
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,640
degrees highlighted in gray here. And 
these have an 

76
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,380
intersection point S, if you like. 

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,680
And this is where an angle is created. 

78
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
It is marked in black here. 

79
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,520
However, the S does not always stand for 

80
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,220
intersection. It can also stand for 

81
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,760
starting point or 

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
vertex. 

83
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,420
If you are really only 

84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,560
looking at the angle, it is common to call 
it 

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,940
a vertex. And angles 

86
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,220
are always 

87
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,520
named according to the Greek alphabet, 
i.e. alpha, 

88
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,660
beta, gamma, delta, epsilon. 

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,720
The two parts of the degrees that 
intersect 

90
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,400
here, i.e. the parts that 

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,640
we can see on this diagram, 

92
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,480
are called legs. 

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,200
There are several ways to 

94
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,080
measure an angle. However, it is almost 

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,240
always measured in degrees. There are also 

96
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,360
other units or ways 

97
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,800
of measuring. However, 

98
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,120
the unit of degrees is almost always used. 
This means that the 

99
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,860
complete full circle is 360 degrees. 

100
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,400
This brings us 

101
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,700
to the next slide, 

102
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,440
namely different angles. 

103
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,380
A distinction is made between different 

104
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,960
types of angles depending on the number of 
degrees. We have 

105
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,720

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,380
listed the four most important types of 
angle here. The first is an 

107
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,840
acute angle. It's called that because it' 

108
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,840
s acute here. This means that we have 

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,120
an angle between 0 and less than 

110
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,940
90°. Important, less than 90°. Because the 

111
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,980
90° angle is a special angle. 

112
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,880
This is the so-called right angle. 

113
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,500
The right angle is also indicated 

114
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,760
by the dot in here. 

115
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,400
that means whenever you see that you 

116
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,760
have two straight lines that 

117
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,720
intersect here or two lines and there 

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
is a quarter circle 

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,340
with a dot in it, you 

120
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,900
automatically know that this is a right 

121
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,720
angle and it is marked like this, which 

122
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,280
automatically means that it is 90 

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,200
degrees. then there is the 

124
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,840
obtuse angle, which goes from 

125
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,360
angles greater than 90 degrees up to the 

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
angles that are smaller than 180 degrees 

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,880

128
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,860
it looks like this so here it's 90 

129
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,860
and it goes to everything that 

130
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,320
's obtuse here so if you 

131
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
look at the corner here the 180 degree 

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,880
angle is 

133
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,840
called an elongated angle it's just 
missing here 

134
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,360
we now see 

135
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,420
the obtuse angle for an 

136
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,120
angle greater than 180 degrees and less 
than 

137
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,960
360 degrees that means it is everything 

138
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,660
between if we 

139
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,920
had a complete straight line here and once 

140
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,840
all the way around yes that is then the 
over 

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
obtuse angle so it is actually 

142
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
if you want to draw an obtuse 

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,980
angle in the other direction little 

144
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,880
tip if you 

145
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,600
have to draw something like this , so with 
the 

146
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,780
geo triangle it is to draw here . even 
easier 

147
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,980
to measure the angle from here the 

148
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,480
opposite angle and so we are 

149
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,320
already at circles a circle is 
characterized 

150
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,700
by the fact that it 

151
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,200

152
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,900
has a constant distance from its center m 
away to its outer edges yes 

153
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,040
and this distance is always the 

154
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,180
radius the radius is always 

155
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,980
measured from the center to the 
circumference 

156
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,340
so this around here is the circumference. 
And 

157
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,880
no matter where we 

158
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,840
measure from the circumference to the 
center, we always have 

159
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,860
the radius there. And this is the 

160
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,980
property that you 

161
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,760
have a fixed distance from the center 
point , namely the 

162
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,540
radius. 

163
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,700
In addition to the radius and the center 
point, 

164
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,980
there is also the diameter d. 

165
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,520
Whenever you have to draw circles 

166
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,180
, you are either given the radius 

167
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,540
or the diameter. 

168
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,580
You really need to be careful 

169
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,920
not to confuse the two 

170
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,560
, because the diameter is always 

171
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,560
twice as big as the radius. 

172
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,500
The diameter is the distance 

173
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,920
from the edge point through the center 

174
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,860
to the edge point again. And 

175
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,220
from here to here is the 

176
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,600
radius. And from here to here it 

177
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,020
is the radius again. This means that the 

178
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,320
diameter is exactly twice as large 

179
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,100
as the radius. And if you ever 

180
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,800
have to draw a circle, 

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,820
pay attention, because 

182
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,440
sometimes you will be given the radius and 

183
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,400
sometimes the diameter. When you 

184
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,260
set your compass, you 

185
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,540
always set your compass to the 

186
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,180
radius. In other words, you make 

187
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,740
an incision in the center and 

188
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,820
then draw the compass around it. this 
means that the length that is 

189
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,980
set on a compass is always 

190
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,010
the radius, as I just said, 

191
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,930
around the outside of the circle is the 

192
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,290
circumference, which, as I said, is the 
length 

193
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,850
of the circular path and this can be 

194
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,750
calculated by 

195
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,570
multiplying the diameter by p. the circle 
number 

196
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,010
indicates nothing more than the 

197
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,490
ratio between the circumference and 

198
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,570
the diameter and that brings us to 

199
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,550
the end of the webinar. 

200
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,270
Thank you very much for your 

201
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,190
attention.
