00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,220
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,340
on basic division. 

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,920
Today we will be looking at division, 

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,880
i.e. divided arithmetic. 

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,780
We will first look at a small 

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,340
example and also look at 

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,940
what is important here, i.e. what 

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,700
is important to consider when dividing. 

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,700
We will then look at division 

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,020
by tens and 

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,620
then at written 

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,580
division. 

13
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,020
We also have three 

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,560
examples of written division. We will also 

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,760
deal with division with remainder 

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,100
, i.e. we will not 

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,480
deal with numbers with decimals. At the 
very end, 

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,640
we also have a small 

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,160
reversal task. Let's start with 

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,840
division. We have 

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,080
a division here , 15 divided 

22
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,640
by 5, which is 3. And the question 

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,800
now is, how do we imagine this 

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,700
or how can we imagine it 

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,240
? First of all, the 15 

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,420
here are divided by 15 tiles... and we 

27
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,840
try to 

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,600

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,540
arrange these 15 tiles in groups of 5 
because we divide them by 5. In this case, 
the 5 

30
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,680
fits into the 15 

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,160
rows, so we have no remainder. 

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,820
If we had 17, for example, 

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,440
there would still be 2 tiles at the bottom 
here 

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,800
and that 

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,240
would be the remainder 

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,760
we would have. This means we can 

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,800

38
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,160
form 3 rows with 5 tiles each. And then we 
would have two leftovers. 

39
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,740
In this case, we have 15, which means 

40
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,980
we have no remainder. We can see here that 

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,900
we have five tiles in each of three rows 

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,140
. This means that 15 divided 

43
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,980
by 5 is 1, 2, 3, because we 

44
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,820
have three rows. The answer to the 

45
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,560
question of how many times the 5 fits into 
the 15 

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
is therefore 3 times. 

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,960
The important thing about division is that 

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,340
you can't mix it up. We 

49
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,420
have the 

50
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,500
dividend to the left of the divisor sign 
and the divisor to the right. 

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,840
The result of a division is 

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,620
always called the quotient. The dividend 

53
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,500
is therefore the number that is divided 

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,040
and the divisor is the number that 

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,480
is divided by. In our 

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
example , this means that 15 would be the 
dividend 

57
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,020
and 5 the divisor, and 3 would be 

58
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,400
the quotient of 15 and 

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,620
5. 

60
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,450
As we have just said, it is important 

61
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,750
that you cannot mix them up. 

62
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,950
We are not allowed to swap the dividend 
and divisor 

63
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,610
. This is very 

64
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,170
different from multiplication. There 

65
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,090
we are allowed to swap two factors. 

66
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,250
This is not the case with division. 

67
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,970
Because 15 divided by 5 is 3, as 

68
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,110
we have just seen. And 5 

69
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,430
divided by 15, we can 

70
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,550
't calculate that at all , because we 
suddenly see 

71
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,430
that the 

72
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,150
divisor is smaller than the divisor. 

73
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,710
0, i.e. 0 decimal point, and 

74
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,430
you only deal with that later, in 

75
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,650
year 5 or 6. 

76
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,610
Of course, you can also calculate this 

77
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,330
, but you do it later and is therefore 

78
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,290
not interesting for us at first. 

79
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,090
However, I think you can see very well 
here that 

80
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,870
you still 

81
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,090
mustn 't mix it up , under any 
circumstances. The whole thing can 

82
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,390
also be formulated in general terms: a 

83
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,330
divided by b is not equal to b 

84
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,150
divided by a. The important thing is, 

85
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,550
of course, that this only applies if a A 
and B 

86
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,750
are not the same numbers. 

87
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,650
But this is almost never the case. 

88
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,390
Please remember, never swap 

89
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,170
the divisor and divisor. We have 

90
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,890
another example here , 14 divided 

91
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,610
by 7. 14 is the 

92
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,490
divisor, 7 is the divisor. And our 

93
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,150
technique here is again to 

94
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,890
represent 14 by packets of 7. 

95
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,370
This means that we 

96
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,290
always write or draw 7 tiles next to each 
other until 

97
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,110
we have used up all 14. 

98
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,250
That means that exactly 2 fits in here. 

99
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,890
And so we know that 14 divided by 7 

100
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,890
is 2. This can be recognized by the fact 

101
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,510
that there 

102
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,290
are always 2 tiles on top of each other. 

103
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,510
Divide by a number of tens. 

104
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,390
Dividing by a number of tens 

105
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,250
, i.e. by 10, 100 or 1000, is 

106
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,010
not difficult at all when dividing. 

107
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,790
This is because when we divide by a number 
of tens 

108
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,290
, 

109
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,630
we don't have to do anything other than 

110
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,650

111
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,690
take away the number of zeros from the 
number 10 in our divisions, i.e. 70 

112
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,010
divided by 10 we see that 

113
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,830
10 has a zero, so we take 

114
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,650
away a zero from 70 and get 

115
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:40,130
7 3500 divided by 100 we see 

116
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,850
that 3500 has two zeros 100 

117
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,450
also has two zeros, so we take 

118
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,550
away the two zeros from 3500 We 

119
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,690
then get 35. 

120
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,370
451,000. we see that we have three 

121
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,070
zeros and we divide that by 10. 

122
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,970
that means we take away one zero 

123
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,630
and we get 45,100. 

124
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,590
so we see that we only have two zeros 
left. 

125
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,570
3 minus 1 is two zeros. 2 minus 2 

126
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,290
is zero, so no more zeros at all. 

127
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,190
And the same here. So whenever 

128
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,510
you divide by a number of 10, 

129
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,770
the number of zeros is simply 

130
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,350
taken away. 

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,210
Well, the division of small numbers can be 

132
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,790
calculated using inverse arithmetic 

133
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,210
. In other words, how do I 

134
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,370
multiply a number to 

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,650
get another number? 

136
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,130
For example, how do I multiply the 5 to 

137
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,030
get the 35? 

138
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,890
The easiest way to solve such problems is 

139
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,130
with the small 1x1. 

140
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,510
This means that if you know it, you 

141
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,410
already have an advantage. 

142
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,770

143
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,510
The problem with increasing numbers is, of 
course, that the small 1x1 stops at 

144
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,590
10x10. And of 

145
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,350
course you can also do such tasks with 

146
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,210
numbers of any size. That's why 

147
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,990
you need written division. This 

148
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,690
is an advantage with large numbers. 

149
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,090

150
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,670
However, you also need to know the small 
1x1 for written division 

151
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,690
. 

152
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,670
There are actually two 

153
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,210
principles for written division . You can 

154
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,290
carry out written division with remainder, 
which 

155
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,990
we will also do below. 

156
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,030
But you can also do it with decimals 

157
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,870
, which we won't do here. 

158
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,050
As I said, this will be 

159
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,070
dealt with later , at higher levels. 

160
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,110
And that brings us to 

161
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,250
our example task. Our 

162
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,490
example is 424 divided by 4. 

163
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,570
In written division, 

164
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,170
we always take the numbers from the left, 

165
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,410
i.e. 4 in this case, and 

166
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,970
think about how often our 

167
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,270
dividend, which is also 4 in this case, 
fits 

168
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,830
into the whole number. 

169
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,210
So how often does the 4 fit into the 

170
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,830
4 with all digits ? That is once, so 

171
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,710
we subtract 4 once, i.e. minus 4. Now 

172
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,650
we have a small 

173
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,830
subtraction here , 4 minus 4, which 

174
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,110
we carry out, which is then a 0. And 

175
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,390
now we get the next number 

176
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,550
down, the 2. Now we have 

177
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,410
2. Now we think about how 

178
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,990
often the 4 clearly fits into the 

179
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,910
2. We realize that this is 

180
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,910
not possible at all , because the 2 is 
smaller than the 

181
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,510
4. Consequently, we 

182
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,500
have a 0 here. Next, we get 

183
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,120
the next digit down. 

184
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,240
This is the 4 here and we get the 

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,340
24. And now we think 

186
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,560
again, how many times does the 4 fit into 
the 

187
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,500
24? In this case, that's 6 times. 

188
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,840
In other words, we subtract 24 and we are 

189
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,100
left with 0. The result is then 106. 

190
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,730
I think you've noticed that it' 

191
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,730
s really important to 

192
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,430

193
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,150
master the small 1 times 1 for written 
division so that you can easily work out 

194
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,520
the factors behind here. We 

195
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,500
have another example here 

196
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,700
. 938 divided by 7. First, 

197
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,160
let's start again. How many times does 

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,840
the 7 fit into the 9 whole number? Once. 

199
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,100
Then we write a 1 here 

200
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,400
and subtract 7. 9 minus 7 is 2. 

201
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,880
Now we get the next number 

202
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,020
under the 3. We get 23. How 

203
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,260
often does the 7 fit into the 23 as an 
integer? 

204
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,880
That is 3 times. We then have minus 

205
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,300
21, which means we have 2 left. The 

206
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,900
next number is 8. Let's get 

207
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,180
the 8 down and think about how 

208
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,680
many times the 7 fits into the 28 as an 
integer. 

209
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
Four times, that's 

210
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,060
exactly 28 again , so we also subtract 28 

211
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,280
. And we have a remainder of 0, you could 

212
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,100
say. In other words, we can say that 

213
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,240
938 divided by 7 is 134. 734. 

214
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,180
Of course, there is often the 

215
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,480
problem that it doesn't work out exactly. 

216
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,960
We have an example here, 743 

217
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,240
divided by 3. The procedure is 

218
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,960
exactly the same as just now, only at the 

219
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,840
end you enter a remainder. 

220
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,040
In other words, let's work it out 

221
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,960
together first and then 

222
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,600
enter the remainder at the end and then 
you'll 

223
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,780
probably have understood it. 7, 

224
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,840
so first we start 

225
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,200
here again. 7 divided by 3. How many times 

226
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,900
does the 3 fit into the 7 as an integer? 
That 

227
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,240
's 2 times. So 

228
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,640
we calculate 7 minus 6. That gives us 1. 
Let's get 

229
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,160
the next number, 4. That gives us 

230
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,300
14. 3 fits 

231
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,760
into 14 4 times as an integer . That's 12. 

232
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,420
So next we calculate 

233
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,860
minus 12 again. Write 4 here 

234
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,900
. And calculate 14 minus 12 again. 

235
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,540
That's 2. How many times does the 3 fit 

236
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,800
into the 23 as an integer? 

237
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,320
only seven times that's 

238
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,300
21 so we 

239
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,900
subtract 21 from the seven here and there' 

240
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,140
s a 2 here and we now have 

241
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,640
the problem we can't 

242
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,860
subtract any more numbers we're at the end 

243
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,840
so we stop here and 

244
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,280
write down the remainder 2 so the 
remainder 

245
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,900
is always the number that 

246
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,820
remains at the bottom here if you 

247
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
can 't get any more numbers down that's 

248
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,620
your remainder later you can 

249
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,800
continue calculating at this point but for 

250
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,040
us this is the end for now 

251
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,100
and we say 743 divided by 3 

252
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,060
is 247 with the remainder 2 and that's 

253
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,880
the end of the task. 

254
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,260
Finally, let's move on to 

255
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,200
inverse problems. You 

256
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,440
always have to differentiate between what 
you are looking for. 

257
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,040
You are either looking for the dividend 

258
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,920
or the divisor. In this case, we are 
looking for the 

259
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,160
divisor, a number divided 

260
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,660
by 2 is 7. The first idea is 

261
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,680
, of course, the idea that you... 

262
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,120
can always cite in such tasks. 

263
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,260
Let's just try 

264
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,040
out a few numbers. That will also get you 
there 

265
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,540
. It just takes a long time 

266
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,640
and in mathematics you' 

267
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
d rather calculate than try things out. 

268
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,300
This means 

269
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,720
that idea 2 is much better , especially 
for large numbers. 

270
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,300
Namely, we 

271
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,720
carry out the inverse task. In other 
words, we do the math. 

272
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Because a number divided by 2 is 

273
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,820
equal to 7. Then we can 

274
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,820
calculate the number by 2 x 7, i.e. if we 

275
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,640
are looking for the dividend, we can 

276
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,740
simply 

277
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,160
multiply the divisor by the result and get 

278
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,280
our dividend, which is 

279
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,260
important in this case 14 this 

280
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,620
only works if we are looking for the 
dividend 

281
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,270
next, of course, we 

282
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,210
still have the case where we 

283
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,390
are looking for the divisor here, too, we 
can 

284
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,310
go there again and 

285
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,350
try out the numbers of 

286
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,970
course this only works partially, 
especially with 

287
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,310
small numbers it works with 

288
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,410
large numbers it is 

289
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,430
difficult again so we 

290
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,210
prefer to calculate this , i.e. idea 2 we 

291
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,750
divide our dividend by 

292
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,270
our percentage, i.e. by our 

293
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,510
result, and thus obtain our 

294
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,190
divisor, i.e. our dividend 35 

295
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,290
divided by 7 is equal to our 

296
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,730
divisor in the case of 5, you could 

297
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,910
try 35 divided by 57, which is correct, 

298
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,430
i.e. whenever the divisor 

299
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,850
is searched for, you divide your 

300
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,710
dividend by the quotient and 

301
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,470
you can do it in the same way It is 

302
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,350
of course also important here that this 

303
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,010
only works if the divisor 

304
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,550
is searched for when the dividend 

305
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,090
is searched for you have the case we 

306
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,830
had before then you can 

307
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,430
multiply 

308
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,290
This brings us to the end of 

309
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,230
the webinar. Thank you for 

310
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,150
your attention.
