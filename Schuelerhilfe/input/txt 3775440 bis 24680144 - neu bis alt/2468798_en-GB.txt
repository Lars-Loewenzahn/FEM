00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,300
Hello everyone. First of all, a quick 

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,840
query. If you 

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,700
can hear me , I would ask you to just 

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,640
write into the chat so 

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,340
that I can see that this is 

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,100
working with the audio. 

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,610
Okay, great. My name is Yannick, 

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,370
I'm from Schülerhilfe and I' 

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,150
m going to talk to you today in this 

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,790
webinar about dealing with 

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,070
non-fiction texts. And we're going to 

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,990

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,470
look at the following two topics : how do 

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,730
I write a summary and how do 

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,030
I deal with tables and statistics 

16
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,830
that are often 

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,590
used in factual texts , and how can I 

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,670
then 

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,050
integrate the whole thing into my 
analysis. 

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,250
First of all, let's 

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,890
differentiate between two categories: 

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,990
non-fictional 

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,770

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,030
texts and fictional texts. So a 
non-fictional text 

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,530
is a reference to the tangible world. 

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,830
The whole thing can be verified by place, 

27
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,270
time, person and plot. 

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,130
And examples of this 

29
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,690
include a news report 

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,050
, a 

31
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,010
feature story, a reportage 

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,970
, an interview or an advertisement 

33
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,950
. A fictional text, 

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,190
i.e. something fictional, refers 

35
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,370
to the fact that it is an invented, 

36
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,750
imagined, fictitious, virtual 

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,750
reality, an 

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,470
invented world. It can be, for 

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,330
example, drama, poetry or epic 

40
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,150
texts, such as short stories, 

41
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,770
fables, novellas or novels. 

42
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,770

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,860
So if I 

44
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,840
want to write a summary . This 

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,080
summary provides brief and 

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,700
factual information about the content of a 

47
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,260
text. It is always written in the simple 

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,640
present tense. It 

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,500
does not contain any personal assessments 
or 

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,480
opinions and is limited 

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,360
to the most important 

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,380
information. And as a 

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,940
rule of thumb, the summary should never 

54
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,160
be longer than a third of the 

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,420
original text. It is just as important 

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,600
that the summary is written in your 

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,760
own words. This means that 

58
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,840

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,040

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,220
you should not copy and paste entire 
sentences from the original text , but 
rather 

61
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,240
try to convey the content in your 

62
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,000
own words 

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,820
. 

64
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,470
A few tips and hints for a 

65
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,130
successful summary. Read the text 

66
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,330
thoroughly and underline 

67
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,350
key terms. These are also 

68
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,410
called keywords or 

69
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,990
key statements. These are key phrases. 

70
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,650
Make an overview of the 

71
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,050
core statements and formulate 

72
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,970
key points in your own words. 

73
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,870
Again, avoid quotes, i.e. 

74
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,550
word-for-word transfers from the 

75
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,430
original text into your summary. 

76
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,830
Formulate complete sentences and 

77
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,470
, very importantly, use 

78
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,110
linking 

79
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,330
words. Use conjunctions and other 

80
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,030
means to incorporate 

81
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,070
varied syntax 

82
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,740
. In a long 

83
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,160
text summary, the 

84
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,040
summary should begin with an introductory 
sentence 

85
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,260
. And the 

86
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,840
type of text is very important. 

87
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,380
So what kind of 

88
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,180
text do I have here? Is 

89
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,820
it a newspaper article? Is it an 

90
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,600
interview? Is it a story? 

91
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,760
Etc. You must 

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,020
state the title and author of the text, if 
available also 

93
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,520
the time and place of 

94
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,480
publication and, very importantly 

95
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,380
, the subject of the text, the problem, 
i.e. 

96
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,380
the core message of the text. 

97
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,100
So what is the 

98
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,140
text being presented about? To 

99
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,020
briefly 

100
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,680
summarize this once again. 

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,300
First of all, we differentiate between 

102
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,420
non-fictional and fictional texts 

103
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,020
, or literary texts . 

104
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,840
The summary of a text 

105
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,260
always provides brief and factual 
information about its 

106
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,040
content and is limited to the 

107
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,100
really essential content. A 

108
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,700
summary is always written in the simple 
present tense 

109
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,340
and does not contain any 

110
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,300
personal evaluations or 

111
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,340
statements. Follow the 

112
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,820
procedure and tips for a 

113
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,180
successful summary and remember the 

114
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,120
complete introductory sentence, the 

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,340
so-called umbrella sentence. 

116
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,060
Now let's move on to another point 

117
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,220
, namely tables and statistics. 

118
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,820
Many factual texts use tables 

119
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,260
and/or statistics to 

120
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,220
support their arguments credibly. 

121
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,940
It is important, 

122
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,300
for example for a summary, to 

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,900

124
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,800
know the different forms of presentation 
and to 

125
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,720
be able to name them correctly. In the 
following, you will be introduced to all 
the 

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,380
important forms of presentation with 

127
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,720
their English names using 

128
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,080
the example of the Bundestag election. 
Election in 

129
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,920
Germany in 2017 

130
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,880
. So we have a 

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,200
table here and this 

132
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,930
table, or a table in 

133
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,550
general, gives a very formal 

134
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,350
and not very clear overview of 

135
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,050
important facts. 

136
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,920
We 

137
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,640
have a heading in the table, namely the 

138
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,760
election results of the 

139
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,960
2017 Bundestag election . We have listed 
the parties 

140
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,480
in the outermost column, 

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
the percentage share and 

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,580
the corresponding seats in the Bundestag. 

143
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,710
This table could now 

144
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,650
also 

145
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,470
be presented graphically in a different 
way, for example in the form 

146
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,590
of a pie chart or pie chart. 

147
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,070
A pie chart is used to 

148
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,330
show individual parts in comparison to the 

149
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,790
whole. And here we have 

150
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,450
two representations. 

151
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,650
One in a 2D and one in 

152
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,130
a 3D variant. 

153
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,510
Another way in which 

154
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,310
data can be displayed in 

155
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,430
a factual text is 

156
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,270
the bar chart, for example. 

157
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,570
The bar chart can 

158
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,250
be displayed as shown here so that the 

159
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,490
data points are on the Y-axis 

160
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,370
. However, we can also rotate the 

161
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,470
whole thing 90 degrees to the right so 
that 

162
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,310
the bars are on the X 

163
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,370
 axis. This 

164
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,110
doesn't really matter in this case and 
makes 

165
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,710
no difference. 

166
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,380
We can also do this here, which 

167
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,200
in this case would be the bar chart. 

168
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,660
The bar chart is 

169
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,640
very similar to the bar chart. And we 

170
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,100
can also 

171
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,680

172
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,700
display the progression in a completely 
different way here, for example. For 
example, in a 

173
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,900
hierarchical order. 

174
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,860
Another form of data representation 

175
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,140
is the line chart. 

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,980
Here we have individual 

177
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,920
data points that 

178
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,560

179
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,800
are then connected via a line or by means 
of a line. Data or 

180
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,760
line charts are usually used for 
chronological 

181
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,500
sequences. 

182
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,890
Here are some 

183
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,590
important words, for example, 

184
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,930
or the most important translations 

185
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,130
, which 

186
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,070

187
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,670
should be used in the context of a factual 
text analysis using tables and statistics. 

188
