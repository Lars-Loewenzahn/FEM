Hello, my name is Joshua and today 

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,060
I would like to explain to you what 

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,580
plant 

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,040
photosynthesis is all about in biology . 

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,240
Additional information, for 

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,700
example a basic wiki 

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,580
, is of course 

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,120

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,420
available to you as usual in our online 
learning center. 

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,660
We constantly hear terms such as 

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,360
global warming, climate policy and CO2 

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,220
 neutrality in the news .  Too much 

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,700
carbon dioxide, i.e. CO2, is 

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,320
bad for our climate and therefore 

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,400
also for us, which is why a lot is 
currently 

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,800
being done to 

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,560
reduce the accumulation in our atmosphere. 

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,060
One popular option here is to 

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,120
plant trees, as these 

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,740

21
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,920
convert it into other substances in the 
course of photosynthesis . The term 

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
photosynthesis therefore describes a 

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,140
biochemical process in which 

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,280
plants use light to 

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,140

26
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,260
produce nutrients by converting carbon 
dioxide . 

27
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,880
This conversion process is carried out in 
the 

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,100
chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are 

29
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,720
cell organelles that 

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,460

31
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,320
look green due to the pigment chlorophyll 
. Roughly speaking, 

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,340
the following reaction takes place in the 
chloroplasts 

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,420
. Carbon dioxide and water 

34
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,640
are 

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,720
converted to sugar and oxygen with the 
help of light energy . 

36
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,700

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,480
However, the actual process consists of 
two separate 

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,980
partial reactions. Firstly, the 

39
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,840
light reaction, also 

40
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,680
known as the primary or photoreaction, and 
secondly, 

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
the dark reaction, also 

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,120
known as the secondary or synthesis 
reaction. 

43
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,520
Let us now look at the 

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,000
light reaction. Here, water is 

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,140

46
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,520
split by light energy into oxygen, protons 
and electrons. The 

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,620
oxygen is released and the 

48
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,340
resulting protons and electrons 

49
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,580
are chemically 

50
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,310
bound in the coenzyme NADP plus. The dark 
reaction 

51
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,150
corresponds to the lime. Wind cycle. Here 

52
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,770
is a very simplified version. 

53
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,450
In addition to CO2 and NADPH-H+ 

54
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,690
, ATP is also 

55
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,290
required as an energy supplier. 

56
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,770
A reaction equation can also be 

57
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:24,070
drawn up for the dark reaction. It is 6CO2 
plus 24H 

58
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,450
+, plus 24E-. The protons and 

59
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,450
electrons 

60
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,050
bound in 12 NaDPH-H plus react to form 
sugar 

61
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,330
and 6 H2O. If both 

62
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,050
partial reactions are combined in a common 

63
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,790
reaction equation 

64
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,970
, then this is 6 CO2 reacts with 12 

65
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,770
H2O excited by light energy to form 

66
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,270
sugar and 6 H2O. Here is 

67
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,990
an overview of the most important points. 

68
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,510
1. plant photosynthesis 

69
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,510
generates 

70
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,770
sugar, i.e. nutrients and 

71
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,070
oxygen , from carbon dioxide and water. 2. 
it takes place in the 

72
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,830
chloroplasts and requires 

73
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,650
light energy in order 

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,790
to run. 3. it can be divided into two 

75
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,510
sub-reactions. 

76
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,450
The light reaction, in which water 

77
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,330

78
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,850
is converted into oxygen, protons and 
electrons ? The 

79
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,850
dark reaction, in which sugar is produced 
from 

80
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,330
CO2 and the protons and 

81
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,310
electrons obtained. 

82
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,990

83
