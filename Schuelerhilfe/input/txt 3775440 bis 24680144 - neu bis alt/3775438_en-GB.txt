00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,070
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,150
Schülerhilfe webinar. 

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,590
Today we're going to be looking at how to 

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,910
analyze a political speech and 

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,370
then we're going to look at a 

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,270
text example. We will 

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,890
first look at the general aspects of 

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,750
political speech, i.e. the 

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,970
characteristics and features. 

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,330
We will then look at the 

11
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,370
basics of analyzing a 

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,650
political speech. Following this, 

13
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,170
we will look at the structure of the 

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,950
analysis. And finally, we will 

15
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,330
look at the analysis of the 

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,550
text example using 

17
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,250
rhetorical devices. 

18
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,310
Political speech as such is 

19
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,370
used to 

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,510

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,050

22
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,310
persuade someone on a specific occasion, 
with a specific intention, to a specific 
addressee . In other 

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,630
words, the speaker addresses the 

24
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,750
addressee in order to persuade, with 

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,670
a certain face and with a certain 

26
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,090
intention, on a certain 

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,270
occasion. This means that political 

28
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,030
speech is 

29
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,630
generally used in oral presentations. 

30
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,970
It is not based on facts 

31
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,950
and information, 

32
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,010
but is subjective and aims to 

33
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,570
influence the listener. This means 

34
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,830
that the focus is on influencing and 

35
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,110
convincing the listener. 

36
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,150
Reactions to what is heard from 

37
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,830
the addressees are also immediate 

38
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,370
. This means through shouts, laughter, 

39
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,230
interposed questions or unrest, as well 

40
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,890
as applause. The general intention 

41
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,410
of a political speech is to 

42
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,370

43
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,610
achieve the agreement and conviction of 
the listener . The basics 

44
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,890
of analyzing factual texts. Let's 

45
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,530
start by taking a look at the typical 

46
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,830
tasks involved in a 

47
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,930
political speech. This means that a 

48
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,950
task is basically 

49
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,510
the same . In other words 

50
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,730
, it is basically about analysis, but the 

51
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,370

52
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,850
focus is different. In other words, on the 
one hand 

53
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,570
, you could examine the 

54
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,170
speech in question with regard to the 

55
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,390
speech situation and its intention. In 
doing so, 

56
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,850
we look at the 

57
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,590
speaker 's intention , the speech 
situation, how 

58
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,830
he presents what he presents. 

59
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,890
In other words, we attach great importance 

60
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,590
to how the speech is delivered. Or 

61
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,950
work on the 

62
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,790
speaker's argumentation structure, 

63
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,690
where we look at the argumentation . 

64
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,090
In other words, 

65
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,790

66
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,810
we look at the argumentation structure, 
i.e. we examine the arrangement of the 

67
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,510
arguments, we evaluate the 

68
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,470
arguments, how the arguments are 

69
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,170
presented, how 

70
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,590
they are presented, what 

71
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,150
aids are used to present them 

72
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,450
or examine the speech in 

73
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,150
terms of its language level and 

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,330
its rhetorical center, explain them 

75
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,890
Here we basically focus on the 

76
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,850
language, i.e. we detach ourselves 

77
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,190
somewhat from the arguments, 

78
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,190
so we no longer evaluate 

79
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,370
the content, but we evaluate 

80
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,110
the actual formulation 

81
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,250
, i.e. the language level and the 

82
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,950
use of rhetorical devices and their 

83
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,850
effect. Afterwards, or at 

84
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,310
the end of this webinar 

85
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,790
, we will look at a text example 

86
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,850
in which we 

87
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,770

88
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,890
will address precisely this last task. The 

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
analytical elements of a speech 

90
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,220
are, as already 

91
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,680
indicated in the task, the 

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,060
speech situation, occasion, content and 

93
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,540
topic of the speech, as in the 

94
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,920
speech intention, the language levels and 
the 

95
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,960
rhetorical devices. The same applies to 
the 

96
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,840
style of speech and the concluding 

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,340
summary. These analytical 

98
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,200
elements are always included in 

99
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,780
the analysis, 

100
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,180
but the task determines the 

101
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,840
focus. The 

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,820
argumentation structure requires, or 

103
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,520
if we are talking about the 

104
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,940
argumentation structure, 

105
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,200
it requires a few pointers. This 

106
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,900
means that we first need to 

107
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,160
illustrate a few things. 

108
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,080
On the one hand, we need to consider how 

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,040
the arguments are arranged. 

110
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,580
In other words, is there a linear 

111
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,880
order from the unimportant to the 

112
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,400
important or vice versa? Or are 

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,240
they mixed up? How are 

114
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,160
the arguments illustrated? 

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,180
Are there examples and evidence, for 

116
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,720
example studies, surveys or 

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,420
statistics, as well as investigations and 

118
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,060
then an examination of whether 

119
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,760
the examples given 

120
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,040
are accurate? In other words, are they 
invented 

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
examples, are they invented evidence 

122
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,020
or are they verified, original, 

123
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,720
existing, real evidence that 

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,420
is cited. How is 

125
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,360
the line of thought organized? 

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,540
In other words, is there a stringent 

127
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,720
line of thought, are there 

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
digressions, what is the 

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,620
general development of the 

130
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,940
train of thought, what is the 

131
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,720
coherence and comprehensibility 

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
of the individual arguments or the 

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
individual thoughts that are presented 

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,060
and, finally, what is the 

135
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,140
effect of the arguments. Is it a 

136
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,000
logical argumentation structure 

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
with the effect of the 

138
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,460
speaker 's intention , i.e. does the 
speech work, 

139
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,160
has it achieved its intention, does 

140
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,540
it have the effect it is intended to have. 

141
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,020
We have to ask ourselves these questions 
during 

142
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,880
the analysis if we 

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,940

144
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,080

145
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,950
want to deal extensively with the 
argumentation structure . How is such a 
speech analysis 

146
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,750
structured? Basically, like 

147
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,150
any analysis, a speech analysis 

148
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,390
follows the analytical triplet. This means 

149
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,150
that it is divided into introduction, 

150
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,050
main body and conclusion. In the 
introduction, 

151
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,890
we name the speaker, the title of the 

152
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,090
speech, which 

153
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,010
is usually the most concise sentence of a 
speech, 

154
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,850
such as Yes, we can by Barack 

155
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,030
Obama or I have a dream by Martin 

156
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,450
Luther King or Do you want 

157
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,230
total war by Joseph Goebbels. 

158
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,370
We then name the topic, place 

159
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,550
and time. We name the 

160
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,590
audience. This could be 

161
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,950
the American people and the 

162
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,550
international audience or the 

163
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,630
people invited to the Sports Palace. 

164
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,970
In other words, we could say the 

165
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,010
National Socialist elite. And what 

166
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,650
is the occasion? On the one hand, it can 

167
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,970
be the mobilization of all 

168
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,890
Germans for the final victory or I have a 

169
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,810
dream, the call against 

170
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,710
discrimination against African Americans 

171
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,610
and so on and so forth. So 

172
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,230
basically we have to 

173
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,430

174
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,010
define the superficial, the framework 
conditions. 

175
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,090
We usually do this with an 

176
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,690
introductory sentence in which we name all 
the 

177
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,150
parts that we 

178
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,530
have just named here. In the main part, 

179
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,490
we then go into different 

180
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,250
points. On the one hand, of course, as 

181
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,010
we have already seen at the beginning, the 

182
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,250
argumentation structure and the 

183
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,650
language level, but above all 

184
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,630
we also evaluate the role of the speaker. 

185
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,930
In other words, we ask ourselves how 

186
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,210
the speaker tries to convince the listener 

187
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,370
. In doing so, we examine 

188
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,630
the coherence, 

189
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,710
clarity and 

190
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,030
vividness of the presentation, as well 

191
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,010
as the arguments and ultimately 

192
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,310
the careful 

193
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,290
language analysis to examine the 

194
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,770
strategy. In other words, how is the 

195
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,710
whole thing presented? Does it 

196
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,430
enhance its own value? Does it devalue the 

197
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,990
opponent? Is 

198
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,910
there any appeasement or emotionalization? 

199
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,690
How is the rhetoric used? 

200
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,830
What rhetoric is used or 

201
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,130
are certain facts distorted 

202
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,310
so that it appears that 

203
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,810
individual things have been adjusted 

204
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,750
just to put the speaker in a good 

205
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,230
position. Finally, 

206
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,170
we then deal with the 

207
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,230
results of the analysis, i.e. we 

208
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,830
can 

209
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,950

210
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,490

211
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,730
draw conclusions from our assessments of 
the main part about the effect of the 
speech and the speaker's intention , as 
well as 

212
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,090
providing a final conclusion and 

213
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,030
ultimately a future outlook 

214
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,770
and our own assessment, 

215
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,410
in which the last two points 

216
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,810
should always be 

217
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,730
considered with caution . These should 
usually 

218
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,790

219
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,270
be discussed with the subject teacher 
beforehand , if it 

220
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,390
is an Abitur examination, it should be 

221
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,310
clarified with the German teacher 
beforehand 

222
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,910
whether this is required or 

223
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,410
not. Otherwise, it should be 

224
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,030
listed at the end and considered in the 

225
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,050
future perspective, to what extent have 

226
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,010
things come true, 

227
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,330
to what extent have they failed and 

228
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,630
what is your own assessment, what 

229
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,550
is your own feeling about the 

230
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,930
speech? Not in the sense of how 

231
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,130
I feel about the topic, but whether 

232
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,330
the speech had an impact, including 

233
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,810
on my own personality. The 

234
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,490
analysis and the rhetorical devices 

235
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,730
are presented in the text example. 

236
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,750
We are looking at an inaugural speech or 
we are looking 

237
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,370
at the 

238
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,430
inaugural speech of the President of the 

239
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,710
United States of America, 

240
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,370
Donald Trump, who 

241
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,810
was appointed President on January 20, 
2017 , i.e. he 

242
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,950
was sworn in. And let's take 

243
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,250
a look at his inaugural address. We 

244
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,550
start with the introduction. 

245
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,670
Presidential description. 

246
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,810
President of the Supreme Court 

247
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,870
Roberts, President Carter, President 

248
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,970
Clinton, President Bush, President 

249
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,230
Obama, my fellow Americans 

250
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,750
and people of the world, thank 

251
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,890
you . We, the citizens of America, are 

252
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,590
now 

253
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,170
united in a great national effort to 
rebuild our country 

254
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,990
and 

255
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,370
restore its hope for all our people. 

256
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,190
With that he begins his speech. We 

257
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,850
now begin our analysis with the 

258
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,810
example text and can immediately 

259
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,150

260
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,450
formulate our introductory sentence by 
looking at 

261
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,910
the speaker, the title of the speech, the 
topic, the place, 

262
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,750
the time, the context and the occasion 

263
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,930
. We can therefore 

264
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,170
state three points. 

265
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,870
Because on the occasion of his 
inauguration 

266
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,310
as the 45th President of the United 

267
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,310
States of America, here we 

268
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,850
just share the occasion, the New 

269
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,730
York entrepreneur Donald Trump, who 

270
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,090
is the speaker, gave his inaugural speech, 

271
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,010
what happened and when, on January 20 

272
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,650
, 2017 on the Western Front, where the 
Capitol 

273
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,890
is in Washington DC. Topic. 

274
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,170
In it, Trump emphasizes that the power 
that has been 

275
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,230

276
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,450
abused and used by his predecessors in 
recent years 

277
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,370

278
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,590

279
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,310

280
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,590
would now be returned to the hands of the 
patriotic American people through him . 
Then the audience, who 

281
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,950
is he addressing? The President' 

282
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,830
s speech is aimed in particular at 

283
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,570
his predecessors, the 

284
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,970
American people and international 

285
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,110
audiences . He also addresses 

286
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,730
his critics as well as domestic and 

287
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,970
foreign press representatives. We 

288
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,910
see here that we have named everything 

289
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,330
we find on the left. 

290
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,390
We have 

291
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,210
divided this into three points. That way, 
we can also 

292
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,270

293
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,450
do a basic analysis. This means that not 

294
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,050
everything has to 

295
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,970
be summarized in an introductory sentence 
, but rather 

296
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,090
a formulated, 

297
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,770
generally valid beginning has to 

298
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,560
be made. 

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,060
We, 

300
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
the citizens of America, are now 

301
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,920

302
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,780
united in a great national effort to 
rebuild our country 

303
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,700
and 

304
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,880
restore its hope for all our people. 
Together 

305
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,740
we will chart the course of America and 
the 

306
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,780
world for many, many years to come 

307
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,840
. 

308
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,120
There will be challenges and difficult 
situations, 

309
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,840
but we will get there. For too long 

310
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,460
, a small group in 

311
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,040
our nation's capital 

312
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,300
has benefited from government and the 
people have 

313
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,860
borne the cost. Washington 

314
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,040
prospered, but the people had none 

315
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,560
of the wealth. Politicians 

316
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
were doing well, but jobs were 

317
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,560
migrating and factories 

318
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,780
were closing. The establishment protected 

319
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,320
itself, but not the citizens of 

320
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
our country. Their victories 

321
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,940
were not your victories, their triumphs 
were 

322
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,780
not your triumphs. And while they were 

323
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,560

324
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,520
celebrating in our nation's capital , 
there was 

325
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,140
little 

326
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,940
to celebrate for subsistence-level 
families in our country . At the center of 
this movement 

327
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,500
is the crucial belief 

328
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,660
that the nation exists to serve its 

329
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,840
citizens. America wants 

330
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,240
great schools for their children, 

331
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,340
safe neighborhoods for their 

332
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,400
families, and good jobs for 

333
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,720
themselves . 

334
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,700
Americans want great schools for 

335
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,760
their children, safe neighborhoods for 

336
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
their families, and good jobs for 
themselves 

337
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,220
. These are justifiable and 

338
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,880
reasonable demands for 

339
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,580

340
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,520
righteous people and a righteous world 
public. 

341
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,220
We now come to the main part of our 

342
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,780
speech analysis, in which we 

343
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,300

344
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,160
find exemplary formulations presented 
once. We will now look at 

345
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,720
the assessment of the speaker's role and 

346
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,620
examine the coherence and 

347
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,000
clarity as well as the 

348
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,220
clarity of the speech, i.e. 

349
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,560
the arguments put forward. 

350
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,100
By way of introduction, President Trump 
takes 

351
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,060
the side of the American 

352
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,220
people and thus emphasizes his 

353
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,880
solidarity with them. He motivates 

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,760
his audience to 

355
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,480
support his time in office 

356
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,520
by promising them that he will pursue 
policies for the people and 

357
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,400
against the establishment. 

358
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,600
Trump repeatedly cites examples 

359
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,580
in which his predecessor governments 

360
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,720
have apparently failed. In doing so, 

361
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,260
he takes no account of the 

362
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,840
soundness and accuracy of the 

363
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,200
accusation. 

364
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,840
Most of his statements follow the 
description of 

365
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,700
the negative effects of previous 

366
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,180
policies and the positive presentation of 

367
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,880
his plans for America. 

368
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,800
So we move on and now need to 

369
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,180
make some considerations. We 

370
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,240
consider that Trump's speech should be 

371
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,840
placed in a social context 

372
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,720
. In other words, 

373
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,140
we ask ourselves the question, how did 

374
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,080
the election campaign unfold? What 

375
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,640
events or social 

376
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,860
currents were 

377
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,580
recognizable and prevalent in the USA at 
the time ? What 

378
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,600
were the media, social 

379
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,280
and global political reactions to 

380
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,500
his election victory? 

381
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,580
It should also be shown what effect the 

382
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,140
speech 

383
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,740
had on a more differentiated audience. Who 
feels 

384
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,720
particularly addressed and who does not? 

385
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,480
What argumentation structure can 

386
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,860
be presented? This is where we go back 

387
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,080
to the points we 

388
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,180
highlighted earlier when we 

389
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,520
talked about the argumentation structure. 
How 

390
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,000
is it structured? What facial expressions 
and 

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,680
gestures are used? So what is the 

392
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,340
speaker using? We must 

393
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,680
always bear in mind that if we 

394
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
see the speech , we can see it. If we 

395
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,980

396
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,960
have a transcript of the speech afterwards 
, then we can also see 

397
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,140
cheers, 

398
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,360
applause, boos, approval, 

399
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,960
rejection marked in the accompanying text. 
This means that we can also 

400
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,220

401
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,780
draw conclusions about the 

402
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,640
audience and also about 

403
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,100
the facial expressions and gestures of the 
speaker. 

404
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,160
If we only 

405
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,660
have the speech as a text, as a raw text, 
then we can 

406
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,260

407
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,460
analyze this point very little or not at 
all. Then we have to 

408
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,880
address a very important point, 

409
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,540
namely what rhetoric the speaker uses 

410
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,620
and are there any recurring 

411
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,550
features. Rhetorical stylistic devices 

412
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,370
enable us, when we 

413
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,950
talk about them, to 

414
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,250
attract the audience 's attention , 

415
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,830
emphasize important aspects, convince the 
audience 

416
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,750
of a point of view, 

417
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,390

418
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,310
create images in the listener's mind , 

419
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,530
make a complicated issue understandable 

420
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,110
or simplify it, 

421
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,850
convince the audience of our own 
creativity 

422
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,330
and trigger emotions. 

423
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,560
In other words, to trigger emotions in the 
audience, in the 

424
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,540
listener. Let's 

425
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,080
now take a look at a few rhetorical 
devices 

426
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,340
that 

427
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,340
are commonly used in the analysis of a 
speech or in general oratorical rhetoric 

428
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,460
. We are talking about 

429
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,080
allegory, that is, something abstract 

430
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,460
is 

431
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,400
represented by something concrete , Cupid 
for love, Libra 

432
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,100
for justice or Dove for 

433
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,080
peace. We realize that 

434
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,680
there are also some symbols. 

435
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,540
For example, there is also the grim reaper 

436
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,100
for death. This means that abstract things 

437
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,620
are visualized 

438
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,840
, making them tangible and easier to 
understand. 

439
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,720
Alliteration is the repetition 

440
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,060
of initial letters or initial 

441
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,040
sounds, for example through thick and 

442
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,860
thin. Veni, vidi, vici. This is a 

443
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,440
haunting sound that is memorable 

444
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,860
. In other words, important things 

445
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,000
that 

446
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,090
should remain in the mind are made 

447
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,310
very 

448
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,970
memorable by this alliteration . 
memorable. The anapha 

449
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,370
is the repetition of several sentences 

450
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,070
or several parts of sentences 

451
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,710
, such as my house, my car, my 

452
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:18,270
boat, all in the same repetition, 

453
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,150
all 

454
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,870
connected with a possessive pronoun , 
which means that important points 

455
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,370
are underlined and basically 

456
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,070

457
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,190
put on the same level. The climax is a 
ladder 

458
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,710
or an increase or the 

459
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,030
intensity of a statement, for 

460
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,330
example the famous from 

461
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,170
dishwasher to millionaire, which 

462
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,110
is given a certain drama and an 

463
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,670
emphasis on central aspects, which 

464
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,790
ultimately also 

465
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,510
have an emotional effect, because they 

466
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,670
are heightened in a 

467
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,730
moment of tension. The antithesis 

468
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,490
is a counter-assertion, where 

469
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,170
two things are set against each other, for 

470
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,890
example, art is long and 

471
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,670
our lives are short . The 

472
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,950
invalidation of arguments is usually 

473
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,730
deliberate. 

474
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,050
The euphemism is a certain 

475
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,470
euphemism. 

476
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,610
Let's take a look at an example. 

477
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,510
Ten employees were made redundant 

478
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,190
instead of being dismissed or 

479
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,210
made redundant. The intention is to 

480
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,290

481
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,850
soften precarious issues and to make them 
shallow. 

482
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,310
The mythonomy is the renaming 

483
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,230
or replacement of the actual 

484
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,990
term, for example person instead of 

485
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,770
thing or abstract instead of 

486
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,450
concrete, for example Bacchus instead of 

487
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,190
wine or Greece instead of the 

488
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,090
Greek government, just what 

489
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,650
Trump did earlier, 

490
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,350
i.e. 

491
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,250

492
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,150
naming Washington DC as basically the 
American government . 

493
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,910
This gives 

494
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,870
a more vivid and authentic shape to a 

495
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,530
circumstance and ultimately 

496
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:08,150
makes larger 

497
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,170
issues more tangible . In other words, it 

498
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,310
is easier to imagine a Washington D.C. 

499
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,210
than the American government with 

500
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,730
its individual faces. When we 

501
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,170
talk about Washington D.C. or the Capitol 

502
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,090
, we know that this refers to 

503
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,010
the government apparatus as a whole 

504
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,350
, without 

505
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,150
naming it specifically. That means we are 

506
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,030
also simplifying something. We are 
breaking something down. 

507
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,470
The metaphor is a generally valid 

508
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,310
transfer or a 

509
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,630
generally valid expression that 

510
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,590
is replaced by something more descriptive. 

511
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,010
In other words, the high-flyer or the 

512
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,750
elevator crew are 

513
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,170
figurative actors with a 

514
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,690
particular emphasis on their 

515
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,330
characteristic. 

516
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,930
Personification is the 

517
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,150
humanization of things, animals 

518
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,250
or objects or even plants. 

519
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,130
The wind whistle, for example, is 

520
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,170
a sad song in which 

521
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,150
the wind starts to whistle. Add to that a 

522
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,730
sad song 

523
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,630
and language becomes more vivid and 
descriptive. 

524
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,310
Also 

525
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,130
more authentic in some way. Rhetorical 
questions 

526
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,010
aim to persuade the audience 

527
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,870
. Provocation 

528
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,270
or true agreement is desired. It 

529
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,650
's the famous, do you want 

530
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,590
total war and everyone screams yes. 

531
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,670
Would they burn their money? No. 

532
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,530
Oxymoron is the contradiction, for 

533
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,930
example the black mold or 

534
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,850
invisibly visible. 

535
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,130
The emphasis on inner conflict 

536
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,330
and ambiguity is clear. 

537
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,770
Or the interplay of things that 

538
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,030
don't fit together to 

539
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,530
make this clear. Well, now let's go 

540
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,270
back to the speech we 

541
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,470
looked at earlier and name 

542
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,970
a few rhetorical devices. For 

543
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,250
example, Washington prospered, but the 

544
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,710
people 

545
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,250
had none of the wealth. Here we are 
clearly talking about 

546
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,270
a mythonomy. Let's go 

547
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,890
back and imagine that we' 

548
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,070
re talking about renaming or 

549
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,250
replacing an actual 

550
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,910
term. At the beginning we 

551
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,490

552
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,430
talked about Greece or Washington. Here we 
have 

553
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,350
the Washington we were just 

554
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,510
talking about. Washington flourished, but 
the 

555
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,010
people had none of the wealth. 

556
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,050
have, even the flourishing, no, is 

557
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,910
something, here, if we like, a 

558
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,130
personification of the actual 

559
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,490
city, yes, I mean, well, even 

560
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,190
people cannot, cannot 

561
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,750
flourish, but that makes it clear what 

562
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,470
is meant, this is your country, this 

563
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,390
is your celebration and this, the 

564
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,610
United States of America, is 

565
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,450
your country, we will 

566
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,890
bring back our jobs, we 

567
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,430
will bring back our borders, 

568
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,490
we will 

569
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,870
bring back our dreams , we will 

570
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,410
bring back our dreams. We share one 

571
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,630
heart, one homeland and one glorious 

572
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,970
destiny. Last but not least, we must 

573
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,270
think big and dream even bigger. 

574
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,170
A climax, big, bigger. 

575
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,200
The core elements are basically 

576
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,480
such that 

577
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,500
if we 

578
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,220
want to analyze them briefly and summarize 
them , the core elements of his speech 

579
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
are ultimately 

580
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,220
important for our analysis. 

581
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,820
In other words, these points should 

582
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,200
be mentioned . is based on repetition 

583
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,360
and alliteration. 

584
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,440
He formulates his core statements 

585
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
repetitively. Avoids difficult 

586
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,400
words and technical theology 

587
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,820
, i.e. the language makes use of 

588
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,600
many drastic formulations 

589
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,300
, such as the climax. We 

590
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,780
will see our old alliance, 

591
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,820
our new civilizations. Trump 

592
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,860
uses very simple language, 

593
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,440
as we said, avoiding 

594
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,140
difficult words and 

595
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,660
technical terminology. Effect on the 

596
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,440
listener is a man of the people. 

597
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,360
Trump then also avoids 

598
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,300
simple language by 

599
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,360
avoiding complicated 

600
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,420
sentence constructions. He therefore 
prefers 

601
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,040
the simple main clause 

602
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,360
, the 

603
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,460
parataxis  in itself. There should 

604
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,140
be no fear. Period. We are protected and 

605
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,300
we will be protected. So 

606
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,380
subject, object, predicate or 

607
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,280
subject, predicate, object, if we 

608
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,700

609
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,640
take this not from English but from 
German, 

610
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,480
then we have a simple 

611
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,600
main clause arrangement. 

612
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,020
Finally, we can see 

613
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,580
Trump's general speech here. 

614
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,100
So we can also see here that 

615
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,900
some things are printed in bold. These are 

616
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,420
individual sections that we can 

617
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,580
also find in print to help us 

618
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,720
orient ourselves. When 

619
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,160
analyzing a speech, it is important to say 
that 

620
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,100
different things 

621
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,060
are named , that we look at 

622
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,820
individual things, 

623
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,200
put them into context and then 

624
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,100
finally formulate them 

625
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,380
as we 

626
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,360
have listed them here in short form, 

627
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,160
i.e. 

628
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,820

629
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,460
to examine both the rhetoric and the 
language as well as the content together. 
We also 

630
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,120
looked at 

631
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,940
how to formulate 

632
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,300
individual things. This is what 

633
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,080
the main part should look like. Zack, 

634
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,280
individual points strung together, 

635
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,180
they should be connected. It is 

636
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,200
very important to use the 

637
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,400
generally valid elements of analysis 

638
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,830
, such as conjunctions 

639
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,910
that connect, then 

640
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,690
it should also be shown or 

641
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,550
the linking of 

642
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,310
individual elements such as 

643
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,410
coherence, clarity 

644
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,550
and vividness or 

645
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,670
rhetoric, as we did here 

646
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,910
afterwards. So we 

647
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,390
establish individual things and we 

648
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,950
should always ask ourselves that 

649
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,210
rhetoric is not an end in itself, 

650
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,490
rhetoric always has an 

651
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,770
intention, the function is 

652
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,030
decisive here. 

653
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,390
Well, if there are no more questions, 

654
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,590
thank you for listening and 

655
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,590
see you soon. See you soon.
