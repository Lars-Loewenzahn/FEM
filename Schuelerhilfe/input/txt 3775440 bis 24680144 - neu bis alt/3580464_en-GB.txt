11
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,220
course, I would like the grilled ... 

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,160

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,460

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,740

00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,200
, the homemade tagliatelle with 

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,580
fries for the main course and the 

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,480
chocolate cake for dessert. 

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,980
Anything else? Yes, please. I like my 

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,020
main course frugal. Of course. An 

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,220
hour later. Excuse me, can 

21
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,380

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,640
