00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,230
Hello, my name is Paula and I 

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,450
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,530
at Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,190

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,910
explain the redox reaction to you. In our 
online 

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,810
 learning center you will 

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,970
of course also find a wiki on this topic 

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,690
, in which the 

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,310
basic and important terms 

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:22,570
are explained in more detail. The 

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,850
redox reaction is an important 

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,090
reaction in chemistry and is used in 

13
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,890
many detection reactions. 

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,890
In order to understand it, we should 

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,970
first 

16
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,230
take another look at the oxidation 
numbers, as they 

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,570
are the basis for 

18
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,490
understanding and applying the redox 
reaction 

19
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,890
. If you 

20
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,590

21
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,330
would like to find out more about 
oxidation numbers 

22
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,390
, you can watch the video 

23
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,290
Oxidation numbers. Nevertheless, 

24
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,710
I will also 

25
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,430
briefly 

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,730
mention the most important facts about 
oxidation numbers here. For 

27
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,470
elementary substances 

28
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,150
, the oxidation number is 0. Elementary 

29
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,870
means that they do not 

30
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,790
occur in a compound. 

31
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,610
It is important to 

32
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,770
pay attention to additional information , 
such as whether the 

33
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,690
elementary substance 

34
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,110
is negatively or positively charged. If 
neither 

35
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,310
is the case, the 

36
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,010
oxidation number of the substance is 0. 

37
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,190
Hydrogen, for example, usually has 

38
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,410
an oxidation number plus 1 and 

39
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,250
oxygen minus 2. It is important to note 
that 

40
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,930
the compound of several elements 

41
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,950
must always be 0 if it 

42
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,690

43
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,150
is not negatively or positively charged. 
Let's take a look at the example of the 

44
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,050
reaction between copper oxide and 

45
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,130
hydrogen. I will come back 

46
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,890
to this later. The 

47
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,650
oxidation number is written above the 
substance 

48
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,410
with a plus or minus sign and 

49
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,690
a Roman numeral. 

50
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,950

51
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,450

52
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,870

53
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,150
Colors are often used to illustrate 
whether the oxidation number is positive 
or negative. 

54
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,590
For example, use green for 0, red for 

55
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,710
negative numbers and blue for positive 

56
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,090
numbers. So, after a 

57
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,170
brief repetition of 

58
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,810
oxidation numbers , we now come to the 

59
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,490
redox reaction. You may be wondering 

60
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,070
why this is 

61
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,370
actually called a redox reaction. It's 
quite 

62
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,070
simple. The name redox 

63
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,910
is made up of the terms reduction and 

64
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,770
oxidation. The initial letters of 

65
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,690
both processes therefore form the 

66
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,390
term redox. Let's now take a look 

67
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,730
at what exactly a 

68
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,450
redox reaction actually is. 

69
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,810
As we have just seen in the naming 

70
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,130
, the redox reaction consists of 

71
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,050
at least one oxidation and 

72
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,950
at least one reduction. 

73
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,290
Oxidation occurs when 

74
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,790
electrons are released . 

75
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,150
The opposite is true for reduction. 

76
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,950
Here the electrons are 

77
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,270
absorbed. A reducing agent 

78
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,030
is also called a donor and is 

79
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,470
responsible for 

80
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,590
releasing electrons in the reaction. 
Conversely 

81
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,370
, the oxidizing agent, also 

82
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,050
known as an acceptor, accepts the 

83
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,210
electrons . Let's come back to 

84
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,710
our example. The reaction of 

85
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,030
copper oxide and hydrogen to water 

86
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,490
and copper. First we set up the 

87
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,850
reaction equation. Then 

88
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,370
the oxidation numbers are 

89
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,450
written above each element. Now 

90
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,350
compare the oxidation numbers 

91
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,270
on the reactant and product sides 

92
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,330
. You can see here 

93
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,630
that the oxidation number of Cu, i.e. 

94
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,650
copper, goes from plus 2 on the reactant 

95
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,150
side to 0 on the product side. 

96
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,770
A reduction is therefore taking place 
here. In the case of 

97
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,430
hydrogen, you can see that 

98
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,690
the oxidation number 

99
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,110
was 0 on the reactant side and plus 1 on 
the product side, 

100
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,870
so oxidation is taking place here. 

101
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,850
As this reaction involves oxidation 

102
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,330
and reduction, it 

103
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,370
is a 

104
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,090
redox reaction. Here is 

105
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,710

106
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,410

107
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,710
a brief 

108
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,150
summary of the most important steps that 
you need to follow in the redox reaction. 
Firstly 

109
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,610
, set up the reaction equation. 

110
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,950
Secondly 

111
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,610
, write down the oxidation numbers . 
Thirdly 

112
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,430

113
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,210
, compare the oxidation numbers of the 
product side and the reactant side. 
Fourthly, if 

114
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,930

115
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,070
there is both a reduction and an oxidation 

116
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,610
, it is a redox reaction. I hope 

117
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,330
I have been able to help you 

118
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,290
better understand the topic of redox 
reactions. 

119
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,570
