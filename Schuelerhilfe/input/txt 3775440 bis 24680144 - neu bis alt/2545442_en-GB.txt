00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,590
Welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,110
Schülerhilfe webinar on 

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,410
basic addition. 

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,690
Today we want to take a look at how we 

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,930
add numbers together, then how 

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,010
we 

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,030
carry out written addition , what the tens 
transition 

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,390
is and how we 

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,930
add large numbers. Let's start with 

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,470
addition itself. How can you 

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,330

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,570
even imagine the calculation 4 plus 5 
equals 9 ? Well, we have 

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,810
a number line. And on the 

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,710
number line we mark the 

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,790
first number, 4. If we now 

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,930
add 5 , we go 

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,130
5 steps further to 

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,610
the right on the number line and end up 
with 9. 

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,910
We have now added 4 and 5. 

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,280
When adding, we always add 

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,820
two addends. This is what we call the 

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,560
numbers we want to add. 

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,580
We call the result of the addition the 

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,300
sum. The order of the addends 

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,320
has no effect on the 

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,140
sum. In other words, it doesn't matter 
whether we 

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,040
add 4 plus 5 or 5 plus 4. The 

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,440
result is the same. In general, 

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,500
we also say that a plus b is b plus a. 

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,640
We can 

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
use any numbers for a and b. 

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,080
Another example is the task 

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,800
3 plus 7 plus 1, i.e. with more than 

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,820
two summands. We have 3, go 7 

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,860
steps to the right and then 

36
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,880
another step to the right 

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,300
and end up with 11. Alternatively 

38
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,260
, we can also imagine the numbers as dots 

39
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,720
. So 3 would be 3 dots, 7 

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,320
would be 7 dots, 1 would be 1 dot. Then 

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,560
we simply put the dots 

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,560
together in blocks of five. So 5, 5 and 

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,900
1, which means we have 5, 10, 11 as 

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,260
the result. 

45
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,120
Another example is 22 plus 15 

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,700
plus 4, where the number line is 

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,780
very long and no longer 

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,280
clear. This means 

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,740
we don't use it here. 

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,220
However, we can do the whole thing 

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,460
with dots again . But here, too, 

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,020
we realize that we have to 

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,960
write down 22 dots for 22. 15 for 15. 4 

54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,120
for 4 and would then 

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,900
write them down in blocks of 5. 

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,260
However, we can also use written 

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,300
addition instead . With 

58
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,500
written addition, we write down 

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,280
2 or more addends 

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,140
one below the other. This is particularly 

61
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,860
useful for larger numbers. 

62
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,580
Let's take 12 plus 4 as an example. 

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,620
We write the two numbers 

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,260
one below the other and then add the 

65
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,020
1s together, i.e. 2 plus 4 is 6 

66
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,700
and the 10s together, i.e. 1 plus 

67
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,080
2 is 3. Then we 

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,720
just add the two numbers together. The 

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,620
result is therefore 36. 

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,050
3 10s and 6 1s. Now what 

71
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,270
if we 

72
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,150
have an example like 17 plus 25 ? We add 
the one, 7 plus 

73
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,930
5 equals 12, which means that 

74
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,750
we can no longer 

75
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,570
simply add our numbers together. If we 
were to 

76
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,930
do this, we would 

77
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,210
calculate 1 plus 2 for the 10s , which 
would be 3, and 

78
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,350
add the numbers together, then our 

79
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,730
result would be 312. Of course, that 
makes... 

80
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,750
no sense. Instead, when we 

81
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,470
add the 1 and get above 10, 

82
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,950
we remember the 2 for the 1s 

83
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,490
and write a 

84
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,110
small 1 for the 1 under the 10s. 

85
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,210
Then we know that we 

86
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,770
also have to add them. We 

87
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,070
then calculate 1 plus 2 plus 1 for the 

88
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,510
10s, i.e. 4. This means that our 

89
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,570
result is 42. We remember that 

90
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,770
if the intermediate result is greater than 

91
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,070
10, 

92
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,410
a 1 must be added to the next digit. So, 1 

93
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,370
together is greater than 10, which means 
we 

94
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,590
add a 1 to the tens. 

95
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,250
Let's look at the whole thing again for 

96
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,510
a larger task. Then 177 

97
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:32,010
plus 94 plus 53. We start with the 

98
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:39,230
ones. 7 plus 4 plus 3 equals 14, which 

99
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,170
means we write the 4 as a 

100
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,650
number of ones. And write the 1 

101
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,550
in lower case under the tens. Then 

102
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,870
we continue with the tens. 7 plus 9, 

103
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:00,730
plus 5 plus 1 equals 22. We write the 2 

104
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,430
as a number of 10 and 

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,610
transfer the 2 from the 20 under the 

106
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,730
100s. Here we calculate 

107
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,310
the 100s . 1 plus 2 

108
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,230
equals 3. We write down 3 as a number of 
100 

109
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,810
. Our result is therefore 

110
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,950
324 

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,120
. With this calculation technique, even 

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,900
large numbers are no longer a problem. For 

113
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:43,880
example, 45,642 plus 101,569. We 

114
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,160
simply write the two numbers 

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,020
one below the other and go 

116
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,840

117
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,980
through the individual sums digit by 
digit. So 2 plus 9 is 11, and 

118
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,820
we write down the 1. 

119
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,980
We write the 10s 1 under the 10s. 4 plus 

120
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,160
6 plus 1 is 11 again. We write 

121
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,860
down the 1 and transfer the 1 as a 

122
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,240
10. 6 plus 5 plus 1 is 12. 

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,380
We write down the 2. The 1 is transferred 
again 

124
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,080
. 5 plus 1 plus 1 is 7. 

125
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,800
We don't need to 

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,700
transfer anything here. 4 plus 0 is 4 and 
1 plus 

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,040
0 remains 1. This means that our result 

128
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,740
for these two large numbers is 

129
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,060
147,211. 

130
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
This brings us to the end of 

131
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,380
today's webinar. 

132
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,020
Thank you 

133
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,780
for your attention and have a 

134
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,500
nice day.
