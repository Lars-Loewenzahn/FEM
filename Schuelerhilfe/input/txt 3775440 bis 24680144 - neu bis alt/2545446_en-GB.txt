00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,480
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,360
linear systems of equations part 2. 

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,040
In this webinar we will 

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,920

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,540
deal with solving linear systems of 
equations . We will 

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,180

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,420
do this in this webinar with the Gauss 
algorithm . That is why we will look at it 

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,180
first and then 

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,760
we will solve an exemplary 

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,180
system of equations with it. 

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,880
We will then look at how 

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,000
the three cases for a 

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,280
solution, i.e. a solution, an infinite 

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,120
solution and no solution, can be imagined 
in practice 

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,620
. And finally, we will look 

16
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,120
at how to 

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,480

18
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,340
proceed with an underdetermined system of 
equations . And that brings us 

19
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,680
to the Gauss algorithm. 

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
As I said, the systems of equations 

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,100
that we look at in this webinar 

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,400
are solved using the Gauss algorithm 

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,240
. The Gauss algorithm 

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,300
is a straightforward solution method for 
solving 

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,160

26
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,520
systems of linear equations. It 

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,200
is actually based on the addition 

28
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,880
method and you try to 

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,180

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,060
delete a variable in an algorithm through 
the line , so it 

32
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,840
actually works 

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,060
with the Kaufs 

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,920
algorithm, which is called a professional 
algorithm 

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,780
that follows the concrete path that 

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,260
could 

37
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,920
be generated diagonally and it is not as 

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
arbitrary as perhaps the 

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
addition method. And you 

40
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,120
might even recognize that. 

41
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,780
At the very end, when we 

42
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,720
have determined a variable, we 

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,180
always set the lowest one, 

44
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,840
or the one furthest 

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,980
to the right. 

46
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,280
Once we have determined this , we always 
insert the variable 

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,600
into the 

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,040
equation above it and have thus 

49
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,820
finally determined all the variables. 

50
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,780
We will demonstrate the whole thing below 
using 

51
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,940
this system of equations. 

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,380
So the first equation is x 

53
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,000
plus 3y plus 3z equals 2. The 

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,940
second equation is x plus y plus 

55
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,160
z equals 2. The third equation 

56
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,340
is 3x plus 3y plus z equals 

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,460
0. This means that 

58
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,740

59
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,980
we have 

60
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,460
three equations and three unknowns with 
regard to our underdetermined systems of 
equations , which we will discuss later. 

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,780
This means that we already have 

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,720
as many equations 

63
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,260
as unknowns. This means that as long as 
there 

64
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,160
are no multiples, the 

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,540
system of equations is determined. 

66
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,620
So it is obviously 

67
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,800
not underdetermined in this case. As I 
said, 

68
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,100
you would now have to check whether there 

69
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,940
are multiples here. If we 

70
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,200
look now , not at first. So 

71
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,260
for now, it seems that we 

72
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,000
can determine it , so let's 

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
just try the causal algorithm. 

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,820
I have already 

75
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,700
told you about a diagonal when we bought 
it, 

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,600
we want to create a diagonal 

77
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,940
, i.e. the first equation should have xy 

78
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,740
z as three variables, the 

79
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,220
equation below only has y and z 

80
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,780
and the last equation still has the 

81
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,340
last variable z, which is the 

82
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,280
diagonal form and so 

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,900
in the first step we delete the x in the 

84
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,300
equation 2 and the triangle in 

85
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,640
equation 3 for this we have to 

86
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,500
have an x here we also have 

87
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,400
an x that means that the 

88
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
sign is the same therefore we have to 

89
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,580
subtract 

90
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,300
in any case in terms of number we have the 
same on 

91
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,720
both only once therefore we can 

92
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,440
simply calculate equation 2 minus 

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
equation 1 there we have the 

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,260
x-minus x-minus will be out with 

95
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,200
equation 3 we have 3x with equal 

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
1 then it is still a lot 

97
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,120
that means to delete 3x we 

98
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
have to 

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,340
subtract in any case only the sign 

100
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,020
is the same again but this time we have to 

101
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,280
subtract with 3 times equation 1 

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,100
because here we have 3x and 7x 

103
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,980
therefore we calculate the equation 3 

104
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,500
and 3 times equation 1 that means 

105
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,900
concretely we are not only calculating 

106
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,040
the x but also 

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
the y and of course the 

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,800
eyes of the other side are the same as 

109
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,560
we know from the action method that means 

110
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:12,840
we calculate xx y minus 2 y z minus 3 

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,800
and very important 2 minus 2 for 

112
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,900
equation 3 it is a bit 

113
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,740
more difficult because now we have to 

114
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,720

115
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,040
multiply everything by 3 immediately that 
is, we have 

116
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,360
3x minus 3 times x plus 3y minus 3 times 

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,220
2y plus z minus 3 times 3z. This is 

118
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,220
equal to 0 minus 3 times 2, which 

119
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,940
we have calculated here. So 

120
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,920
x minus x is 0. y minus 2y is 

121
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,080
minus y. z minus 3z is minus 3. 2z 

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,500
and 2 minus 2 is 0. 3x minus 3x is 

123
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,260
of course also 0. That was just the 

124
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,740
reason why we chose the factors the 

125
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,920
way we did 

126
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,380
, so that we can 

127
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,000
cancel out the x here. 3y minus 3 times 
2y. That 

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,460
's 3y minus 6y and that's minus 3y. 

129
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,970
Now we still have z minus 3 times 13 

130
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,210
boys mate is 19 and z 19 are 

131
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,670
minus 8 and that is equal to 0 minus 3 

132
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,170
times 2 so we already have in the 

133
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,470
second 

134
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,250

135
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,610
equation only the two unknowns and in the 
third equation 

136
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,890
we need a lot of diagonals so that we have 
the y 

137
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,030
-mini we 

138
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,690

139
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,470
have created the two calculations here 
through an action we give them 

140
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,050
the following new names the names 

141
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,630
simply continue the one sequence that 

142
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,910
is the same here that is 

143
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,130
also 

144
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,290
worked with knitting something in advance 
and are 

145
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,250
the same with two strokes would be around 

146
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,010
the three strokes that 

147
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:10,350
is also important and that is called, 

148
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,650
the next step is to look at 

149
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,150
this invoicing system. As just 

150
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,790
mentioned, the minus 

151
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,230
3y still have to be eliminated, then 

152
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,310
we have this 

153
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,150
diagonal form. 

154
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,550
We eliminate the minus 3y by adding 

155
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,990
it to the line above it, 

156
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,010
which is this one. And the question 

157
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,710
now is, do we have to add, 

158
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,350
subtract and how? we need 

159
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,130
the equation. We see here that we 

160
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,830
have minus y, here we have minus 

161
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,370
3y. So this is equal to the same thing 

162
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,290
, which means we have to 

163
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,690
subtract in any case. We have 

164
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,190
3y here, only 1y, so we have to 

165
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,710
calculate with the same 5, so the 

166
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,190
unnecessary, minus 3 times the same 4. 

167
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,410
That's when you calculate 

168
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:01,730
minus 3y, minus 3 times minus y, minus 

169
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,690
3 times minus y plus 3y. That is 

170
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,030
exactly the same. Minus 2y plus 3y is 

171
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,710
of course 0, which is how it should 

172
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,250
be. We continue with the 

173
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,410
minus 8z. Minus 8z minus 3 times minus 

174
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,030
2z. Minus 3 times minus 2z is plus 

175
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,450
6z. In other words, it says minus 8z plus 

176
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,570
6z. And that's minus 2z. Last but not 

177
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,050
least, minus 6 times, sorry, 

178
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,290
minus 6 minus... times 0 that's 

179
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,890
simply with 6 10 minus once and 

180
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,750
so we have already 

181
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,390
reached the plan form 

182
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,470
we have now in the lowest 

183
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,410
equation of the equations growing 

184
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,070
down here we only have 100 there 

185
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,970
is now minus 2 z is equal to 6 6 

186
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,350
and from this we now directly calculate 

187
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,580
our variable z minus 6 the number 

188
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,480
by minus 2 is important minus by 

189
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,280
minus is already plus and 6 by 2 

190
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,400
is 3 and so we come to z is 

191
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,300
equal to 3 and now comes what I 

192
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,780
said at the beginning but that we 

193
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,480

194
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,100
always insert into the equation above it 
by the diagonal 

195
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,620
form that was in the Gaussian 

196
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,680
 algorithm.algorithm, each 

197
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,460
equation above one  has 

198
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,660
one more variable. 

199
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,620
In other words, we now see that the 

200
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,840
equation above it 

201
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,940
has the variable z and 

202
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,680
y in comparison 4 , i.e. it has the 
variable y 

203
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,800
in addition. The equation above here 

204
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,380
has z, y and x. 

205
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,160
And it always goes on like this, that 

206
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,200
is, if the system of equations 

207
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,920
is correspondingly larger, the 

208
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,420
equation would have one more variable 

209
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,920
and therefore we simply start with 

210
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,120
the first year and 

211
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
then the same again and can thus 

212
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,020
always determine one more variable, that 

213
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,200
is, we now set 4 1 

214
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,720
y minus y minus 2z is equal to 0. 

215
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,160
We know minus 3z, or rather 

216
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,660
we know z , which is 3. So we arrive 

217
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,340
at minus y minus 2 times 3 equals 

218
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,200
0. Minus 2 times 3 is minus 6, so y 

219
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,740
minus 6 equals 0. We 

220
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,000
quickly transform this to y by 

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
adding plus y. Then . Then y is 

222
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
equal to minus 6. we now know 

223
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,340
our y and give another 

224
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,040
equation higher. 

225
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,980
we now also do this 

226
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,900
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 

227
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,880
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 

228
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,320
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 so that means 
the 

229
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,300
solution for the same system is 

230
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,660
x5 and thus 

231
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,160
the system is already solved in the 

232
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,520
following we see two 

233
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,800
look there and these numbers as you 

234
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520

235
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,220

236
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,200

237
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
can graph the solution of a sliding 
system, in which you can only graph it 
with two equations . In fact, we 

238
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,420
see a coria system here and the fact is 
that 

239
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,000

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,760

241
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,620
if you have a sliding system with two 
equations , you 

242
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,000

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,960

244
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,000
could also draw these two equations on the 
straight lines in such a conventional 
context . The quick point of these 

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
two straight lines would then be the 
solution 

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,360
. In other words, this is a 

247
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
solution that we have just 

248
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,420
had so far . The next case is no 

249
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
solutions, which means that the lines 

250
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,000
are parallel to each other. This is 

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,780

252
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,980
always the case with a certain solution 
field because you 

253
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,440
get a false statement. For example, 6 is 

254
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,600
equal to 0 and the degrees therefore have 

255
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,880
no common point or no 

256
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,740
Schmitt point and are parallel 

257
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,360
to each other. The last case is that 

258
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,500
there are infinitely many solutions. 

259
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,520
The fact that there are infinite solutions 

260
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,140
is a target distance that 

261
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,480
obtains a statement. And this then means 
that 

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,120
the degrees do not have many 

263
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,140
points in common. Before, in 

264
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,440
this case , they look over each other, so 
it's 

265
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,860
the same straight line. And these are the 

266
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,200
three cases that 

267
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,430
can give you a ride. And that brings us 

268
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,010
to our example. We 

269
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,890
will 

270
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,650
also 

271
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,350
treat the underdetermined system of 
equations with the fitting algorithm 
again. 

272
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,610
I will now explain how you 

273
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,310
could immediately recognize that this 

274
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,050
same system is underdetermined. You 

275
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,670
would probably 

276
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,190
go there first , you have three variants, 

277
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,250
three equations, so it's 

278
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,430
not actually underdetermined . 

279
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,470
The only important thing is that the 

280
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,450
equations must not 

281
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,350
distribute multiple responsibilities. 

282
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,730
I could create 

283
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,390

284
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,830
a 

285
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,630
diverse system of equations from every 
unusual system of equations and thus 
create a new 

286
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,470
equation. 

287
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,850
Of course, this does not apply. Therefore, 
it is very 

288
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,290
important that the equations in the 

289
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
system of equations 

290
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,490
are not multiples . If we 

291
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,970
look at the division of equations, 6x plus 

292
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,470
6x plus 2x equals 0, 3x plus 3x plus 

293
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,350
2x equals 0. You can already see that 

294
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,150
... exactly the factor 2 can be 

295
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,510
equalized by the creation and the factor 

296
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,590
and two is therefore 

297
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,290
already determined 

298
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,460
whoever doesn't see it now and also 

299
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,740
starts to do it at gerührungs is also 

300
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,440
not now comes the point where 

301
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,100
this is determined under is that 

302
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,320
namely 

303
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,940
We see, we 

304
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,780
just have x up here , here we have 6x, 
which 

305
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,280
means the sign is the same, 

306
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,180
so we have to subtract. 

307
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,140
And we have 1x here, 6x here, which 

308
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,860

309
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,500

310
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,760

311
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,660

312
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,580

313
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,480
means we have to subtract 2 minus 6 times 
equation 1. Equation 3 looks similar, the 
sign is the same, which means we have to 
subtract here too. and 3x equals 1 x which 
means we need to 

314
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,540
calculate 

315
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:17,040
6 minus 6 times 12 minus 6 times 12 and 6 

316
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,090
6y minus 2y is minus 6y. 2z minus 6 

317
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,550
times 3z minus 6 times 3z is minus 18z. 

318
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,950
And 2z minus 18z is minus 16z. 

319
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,130
Now we're getting there. 

320
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,830
0 

321
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,450
minus 6 times 2 minus 6 times 2 is 

322
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,350
minus 12 and 0 minus 12 is minus 12. 

323
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:53,390
Let's start right away. 3y-3 times 

324
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,290
2y, minus 3 times 2y are together 

325
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,430
minus 6y and 3y minus 6y are minus 

326
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:10,410
3y. Then we continue. Z, minus 3 

327
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,410
times 3z, minus 3 times 3z is minus 9z 

328
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,750
and z minus 9z is then minus 9z. 8 

329
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,750
z the other side of this don't forget 

330
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,450
0 minus 2 times 2 minus 1 2 

331
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,210
are minus 6 and 0 minus 6 are 4 

332
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,810
minus 6 so we get here and 

333
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,970
we see here again it is 

334
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,830
still multiple and so 

335
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,490
we continue now next 

336
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,170
of course we determine that the 3y 

337
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,370
disappears and we 

338
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,790
get into our diagonal form 

339
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,650
so we subtract with the 

340
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,970
equation 4 yes we have yes because 

341
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,650
again it is not equal therefore 

342
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,330
to train again in this case 

343
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,850
it is just so we have the parts and 

344
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,350
here six therefore we need two 

345
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,530
equal 5. Minus equation 4 

346
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,570
we have both times 6y. 

347
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,110
So the others are minus 6y, 2 times 

348
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,550
minus 3y, minus minus 6y, 2 times minus 

349
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,750
3y is minus 6y and minus minus 6y 

350
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,650
is plus 6y. So the y falls out, 

351
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,890
it becomes 0 here. 2 also counts. 

352
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,970
And now, of course, we have to 

353
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,550
add the 8z . That means 2 times minus 8z 

354
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,390
is minus 16z. Now we have minus 

355
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,410
16z minus minus 16z. That is minus 

356
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,450
and minus is always plus. So 

357
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,150
we have minus 16z plus 16z and that 

358
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,430
's 0. I still have to 

359
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,070
do the other side. 2 times minus 6 is 

360
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,010
minus 12. Now we have minus 12 

361
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,410
minus minus 12. That's also 

362
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,830
plus again , so that's minus 12 plus 12. 

363
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,350
And now we have those 

364
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,770
zero parts I mentioned earlier. One 

365
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,610
equation has suddenly 

366
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,210
disappeared. And that is now the 

367
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,450
point where we know that we now have 

368
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,710
an underdetermined system of equations. 

369
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,490
Because we haven't yet 

370
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,710
determined a variant , but suddenly 

371
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,530
one is missing. And we 

372
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,510
still have two equations up here with Z, Y 
and X. 

373
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,190
This means that the system of equations is 

374
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,490
underdetermined. And an 

375
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,470
underdetermined system of equations is 
solved 

376
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,870
in one parameter. 

377
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,930
this is usually called 

378
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,990
the first variable so 

379
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,050
that and depending on 

380
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,050
this we now solve the same 

381
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,470
system yes so as I said what is 

382
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,770
underdetermined we can no longer 

383
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,310
solve it completely we can only 

384
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,570

385
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,030
solve depending on a few meters and these 
parameters in 

386
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,770
beds and we have now simply 

387
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:59,030
determined that this z 

388
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,410
is equal to our parameter z. Therefore, 

389
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,630
we can immediately start solving or 

390
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,790
calculating the other two 

391
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,090
variables. Of course, 

392
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,930
we can only 

393
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,070

394
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,190
specify the result for y and x as a 
function of our parameters. And because z 

395
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,630
is no longer a variable for us, 

396
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,950
but a parameter and parameters 

397
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,830
are only paid for. now 

398
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,670
we can immediately add 4 to the 

399
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,270
value, which means we have to 

400
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,270
calculate that 16 z is equal to 12 now 

401
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,030
we first have to add 16 z to 

402
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,750
get the 16 zimmer then we have to add 
minus 6 

403
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,670
y is equal to minus 12 plus 6 now 

404
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,770
we have to divide by minus 6 to 

405
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,570
get y and so we 

406
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,070
get y is equal to 2 minus 8 Z. That's 

407
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,670
our solution for y. 

408
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,950
And we now insert this solution for y 

409
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,870
into the equation above. 

410
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,890
As I said, z is a parameter, 

411
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,770
so we know it. Now we 

412
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,370
insert the y and then only 

413
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,990
our x remains. And we do that 

414
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,270
again. Equation 1 here is 

415
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,650
x plus 2y plus 3z equals 2. That 

416
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,170
means x plus 2. to 2 minus 8 

417
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,850
thirds of z, that would be our tube for 

418
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,990
y, plus 3z equals 2. 

419
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,850
Of course, this is a bit more difficult to 

420
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,390
calculate. First, 

421
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,130
we multiply out the parenthesis, which 
means 2 times 

422
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,730
2 and 2 times minus 8 thirds. 

423
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,070
This gives us x plus 4 minus 16 

424
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,590
thirds z plus 3z equals 2. 

425
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,530
Next, we multiply the minus 16 

426
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,410
thirds z and the 3z. That's 

427
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,890
minus 7 thirds of z. This gives us x 

428
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,970
plus 4 minus 7 thirds of z equals 

429
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,890
2. Now we first add the 4 

430
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,230
to the minus 4, which 

431
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,750
gives us x minus 7 thirds of z equals 

432
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,930
minus 2. Now we just have to 

433
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,190
add 7 thirds of z, which 

434
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,390
gives us x equals 7 thirds of z minus 2. 

435
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,230
And that gives us our x 

436
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,930
and our y and our z up to our 

437
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,730
parameter z. Let's summarize what we' 

438
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,750
ve just done. 

439
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,890
we know that this 

440
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,310

441
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,870
is not always an indeterminate system of 
equations if we get a zero line 

442
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,150
, which means that we are suddenly 

443
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,270
missing an equation. the way 

444
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,750

445
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,810
to solve this indeterminate system of 
equations is that we 

446
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,230
solve it as a function of a 

447
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,230
parameter. to do this, we tune 

448
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,570
a variable as a parameter, 

449
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:41,630
actually always the variable z at the 

450
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,470
highest the c so, for example, 

451
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,770
if you take x12 3 you would 

452
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,710
take nothing in as I said, 

453
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,430
we take this variable as a parameter and 

454
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,250
then solve the system of equations 

455
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,890
as a function of this parameter 

456
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,730
. the important thing is that you only 
have to 

457
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,090

458
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,210
introduce a few meters for this to be 
enough . Yes, you will not encounter a 
case 

459
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,510
in school where you 

460
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,750
have to introduce two parameters. 
Therefore, 

461
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,770
only introduce one, otherwise 

462
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,050
the whole thing will no longer work. 

463
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,630
That brings us to the end of the 

464
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,530
webinar. Thank you for your 

465
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,170
attention.
