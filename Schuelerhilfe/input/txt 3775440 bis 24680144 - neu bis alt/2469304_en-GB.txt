00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,980
Good evening and welcome 

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,000
to the webinar on geometry. I 

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,300
hope you can all hear me and that 

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,760
the picture and sound are OK. Here 

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,980
is a brief overview 

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,360
of what you 

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,060
can expect in the webinar. We'll 

8
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,600
start by looking at 

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,880
lines, then figures and then 

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,380
we'll take another look at figures 

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,200
that can be mirrored. 

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,900
Basically, 

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,780
there are different lines in mathematics. 

14
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,460
On the one hand, there are lines. They 
have 

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,560
a beginning and an end. Here we have 

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,800
a beginning, here we have an 

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,180
end. We know there is a 

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,000
point. Then there are also half-lines, 

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
also known as rays. They 

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,440
always have a starting point, but no 

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,120
end point. This means that they run 

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,080
to infinity. Then there are also 

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,380
straight lines. These have no beginning 

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,780
and no end. In other words, they run. 

25
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,570
Yes, they are ultimately infinitely 

26
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,650
long. This 

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,030
is illustrated quite well here again to 
show that we 

28
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,970
don't know where they end and where this 

29
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,770
straight line ends and where it ends. 
where 

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,070
it ends and where it begins. So, 

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,570
let's 

32
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,130
take a look at the properties of lines. 
Two 

33
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,370
lines are parallel if they 

34
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,870
run in the same direction. Regardless of 
whether 

35
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,590
it is a distance, a ray 

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,290
or a straight line. The blue and 

37
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,230
red lines are parallel to one another. 

38
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,350
This means that they have the 

39
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,190
same distance everywhere. The green and 

40
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,050
violet straight lines, on the other hand, 
are not 

41
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,310
parallel because the distance is much 

42
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,110
greater here than here. Lines 

43
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,570
that are not parallel intersect 

44
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,510
somewhere at a point, 

45
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,510
probably somewhere 

46
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,330
around here. 

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,380
A right angle is formed when 

48
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,100
two lines 

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,320
are perpendicular to each other . In other 
words, we have a 

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,660
line here and we have a line here. 

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,680
In higher grades, we learn 

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,780
about the concept of angles. 

53
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,720
In fact, it is basically the 

54
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,400
right angle. This is 90 degrees. 

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,540
You can find a right angle almost 

56
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,660
everywhere. On windows, doors, 

57
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,540
shoe boxes, but also on a 

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,360
sheet of paper. So much for the lines. 

59
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,800
Let's move on to the figures. Figures 

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,540
are created when several points in the 

61
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,620
plane are connected one after the other. 

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,360
Here we have a triangle, 

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,840
here we have a quadrilateral with four 

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,960
corners, here we have a pentagon with 

65
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,940
five corners, here we have an octagon 

66
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,700
with eight corners, if we count them. 1, 

67
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,960
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And here we have 

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,000
a circle with no corners. 

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,140
In other words, these are the shapes 

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,580
we have listed here that 

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,160
you 

72
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,460
are familiar with from school. Let's start 
by looking at a 

73
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,940
quadrilateral. Basically 

74
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,460
, this is actually a 

75
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,820
square. All sides, i.e. 

76
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,940
sides C, B, A and D are the same length 
and 

77
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,400
the opposite sides are 

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
even parallel. They have 

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,900
the same distance everywhere and all 
angles 

80
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,190
have a right angle. So here there 

81
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,970
is a right angle, here there is 

82
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,670
a right angle, here there is 

83
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,410
a right angle and here there 

84
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,330
is a right angle. Because 

85
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,910
the side and the side are 

86
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,550
perpendicular to each other, but also the 

87
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,990
side and the side and also the 

88
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,090
side B and A and so on. Then 

89
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,070
there are also rectangles. In the case of 

90
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,310
rectangles, the 

91
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,530
opposite sides, i.e. C 

92
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,210
and A, but also D and B 

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,130
, are the same length and they are 
parallel. But the 

94
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,190
sides A and B, for example, are 

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,070
not the same length. 

96
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,330
Again, we have right angles in the 

97
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,570
corners, as they are perpendicular 

98
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,890
to each other, the sides. Then 

99
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,550
we have a parallelogram here. 

100
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,110
The opposite sides are 

101
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,350
again the same length, except that they 

102
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,010
are slightly offset. And they are 

103
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,390
also parallel again. We can 

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,650
also see that quite nicely. They're all 

105
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,650
about the same distance apart. 

106
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,060
Then we come to the trapezoid. And with 

107
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,660
the trapezoid, the two 

108
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,920
opposite sides 

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,460
are parallel to each other. 

110
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,060

111
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,760
However, the other two opposite sides are 
not parallel and there 

112
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,220
is no right angle. 

113
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,390
Then we also have an 

114
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,230
irregular quadrilateral here. We see that 
the 

115
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,790
opposite sides are 

116
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,650
neither parallel nor do they have 

117
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,610
the same length everywhere. 

118
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,730
And there is no right angle either 

119
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:53,930
. 

120
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,050
So, we just had a square. 

121
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,770
Then we have a rhombus. With 

122
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,410
the rhombus, all sides are the 

123
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,950
same length again. And the 

124
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,590
opposite sides are also 

125
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,950
parallel again. The only difference is 
that the sides 

126
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,990
are slightly offset, but are still 

127
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,630
parallel to each other and the same 

128
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,030
length. 

129
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,210
We also just had the parallelogram , but 

130
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,510
we didn't have a kite quadrilateral yet. 

131
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,250
Here, the adjacent 

132
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,630
sides are the same length, sides C and 

133
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,090
D, but sides A and B are also 

134
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,610
the same length. However, sides A and D 

135
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,830
or sides B and C are 

136
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,690
not the same length. Here we have 

137
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,430
again 

138
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,950
illustrated a hierarchy of quadrilaterals 
, which are the 

139
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,830
most common quadrilaterals 

140
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,330
that are discussed at school . We 

141
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,170
start with the square, then we 

142
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,470
usually 

143
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,590
look at the rhombus and the rectangle. 
Then 

144
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,490
we look at the parallelogram 

145
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,010
. And last but not least, we look 

146
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,950
at the kite, any 

147
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,210
quadrilaterals and the trapezoid. 

148
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,020
Finally, we look at 

149
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,800
reflection. 

150
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,360

151
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560

152
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,700
We can see this here in the examples 

153
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,960
of our axis and we want to 

154
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,880
mirror this half here so that 

155
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,500
the letter a is created often 

156
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,360
a mirror is 

157
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,320
taken at school and 

158
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,400
held up to the mirror axis so that you can 
see what 

159
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,160
the complete figure looks like yes, 

160
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,240
if you look at another figure here is 

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,500
a trapezoid. 

162
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,380
You can also use the mirror axis to 

163
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,300
mirror each point individually. Here is 

164
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,580
our mirror axis and if I 

165
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,700
now want to mirror this point, 

166
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,220
it lies exactly on the 

167
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,580
opposite side of the 

168
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,130
mirror axis. Then there is also 

169
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,950
the reflection in a point. So 

170
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,150
here is our point. 

171
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,630
This is also known as point symmetry. 

172
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,170
Assuming I want to mirror this point 

173
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,770
here. Then I mirror 

174
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,150
a point symmetry and the point 

175
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,490
is then on the opposite 

176
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,150
side. Of course, I can also mirror this 

177
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,270
point here. At this point 

178
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,310
here, the point is mirrored 

179
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,030
on the 

180
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,050
opposite side . And if 

181
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,930
I mirror the point here, then 

182
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,810
I use the point again. 

183
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,270
And when it is mirrored, it lies 

184
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,930
on the other side, namely here. 

185
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,750
Here 

186
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,110
we have another rhombus and a 

187
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,070
few dots and a 

188
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,190
star that is not yet finished. So, here 

189
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,730
we have our mirror axis again. 

190
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,690
If I 

191
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,650
want to mirror this point here , I look at 
the mirror axis again 

192
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,670
and it's on the 

193
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,590
opposite side. 

194
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
I can do the same with the 

195
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,900
other two points. 

196
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,440
But I can also mirror a figure by 

197
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,700
mirroring each point individually. 

198
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,940
Namely the point here, the point 

199
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,920
here, then it lies here. If I 

200
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,520
mirror this point, it is here. 

201
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,740
And if I mirror this point here 

202
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,700
, it is here. And if I 

203
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,420
mirror the point, it's here. 

204
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,700
And now I just have to connect the dots 

205
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,600
. And then 

206
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,000
a rhombus is created on the other side. 

207
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,200
I do the same with the star. 

208
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,440
Here I also have to mirror each point 

209
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,080
individually. 

210
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,320
I can 't mirror this point because it 

211
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,120
lies directly on the mirror axis. If I 

212
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,500
mirror this point, I end up here. 

213
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,100
If I mirror this point here, 

214
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,780
I end up here. If I 

215
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,280
mirror the point, I end up somewhere 
around 

216
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,420
here. And the point 

217
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,900
doesn't need to be mirrored again because 
it 

218
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,160
lies on the mirror axis. 

219
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,060
In other words, all I have to do now is 

220
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,840
connect these points. 

221
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,060
And then a complete 

222
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,300
star would be created. 

223
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,560
Here are some more 

224
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
examples of point symmetry. 

225
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
We've already talked about this example 

226
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,640
. Here we have 

227
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,900
points again. Here is our point again, 

228
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,620
the red point. 

229
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,180
Yes, we should 

230
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,440
ultimately 

231
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,860
mirror the blue points on this red point , 
i.e. our 

232
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,960
point symmetry. And if we 

233
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,360
do that , if I 

234
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
look at this point here and 

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
mirror it on this point here , I end up 
here. If I 

236
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,380
look at this point here and 

237
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,300
mirror it on this point here, I end up 

238
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,360
here. If I 

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
mirror the point here and mirror it again 
from the point here 

240
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,740
, 

241
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,520
then I end up here. 

242
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,380
Yes, and here, in order to 

243
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,520
mirror this figure , I ultimately have to 

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,780

245
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,620
mark the point symmetry, i.e. the point at 
this point here. 

246
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,280
Of course, I could also 

247
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,580
place a mirror axis at this point, 

248
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,020
I just realized, then I would 

249
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,060
mirror the point again. 

250
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,380
As you can see, there are figures where 

251
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,560
you can use both point symmetry 

252
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,860
and axis symmetry. 

253
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,060
This is really such an 

254
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,660
exception here. 

255
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,910
Yes, thank you very much for your 

256
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,750
attention. Thank you 

257
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,290
very much and I wish 

258
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,110
you all a good evening. 

259
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:56,910
Bye!
