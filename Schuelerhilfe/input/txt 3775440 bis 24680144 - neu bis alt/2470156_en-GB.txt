00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,880
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,840
Triangles. In 

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,900
this webinar we will talk about triangles. 

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,680
We will first look at the properties 

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,140
of a triangle and 

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,500
then do some calculations, i.e. 

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,780
we will calculate the perimeter and 

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,300
area of a triangle. Then 

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,100
we look at different 

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,620
types of triangles and theorems of 
concurrence. 

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,700
At the very end, there is a small 

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,720
example task on the second topic, 

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,660
i.e. perimeter and area, which 

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,940
we then work on together. 

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
a general triangle . What is immediately 

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,780
noticeable, I think, is that the 

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,560
labeling 

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,380
is counterclockwise. So A, B 

19
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,780
and C. The labeling of the vertices 

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,600
is counterclockwise. 

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,920
The sides always have the small 

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,780
letter from the opposite 

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,240
corner. This is why we have the 

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,520
corner point A here and the opposite 

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,640
side is small A. Here is corner point B 
and 

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,600
the opposite side is small B. 

27
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,440
The angles are always 

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,840
sorted according to the Greek alphabet, 

29
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,380
alpha, beta, gamma and 

30
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,380
counterclockwise accordingly 

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,280
For every triangle, the sum of the 

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,620
interior angles is 180° Therefore, 

33
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,500
alpha plus beta plus 

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,980
gamma really always equals 180° This is 

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,480
always the case and so you can 

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,940
quickly check things or 

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,640

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,320
calculate the third angle if you have two 
angles . 

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,760
Let's move on to perimeter and 

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,720
area. The perimeter of a 

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,620
triangle is simply the distance 

42
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,940
you cover when you 

43
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,940
go all the way around. So U is equal to A 
plus B 

44
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,600
plus C. Simply the sum of the 

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,340
edge lengths. 

46
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,680
The area is a little 

47
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,420
more complicated. Basically 

48
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,020
, the triangle is length times height 
divided 

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,200
by 2. Very importantly, we 

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,420
now see three different formulas here, 

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,780
A times HA half A is then the 

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,820
base side and HA is the height that 

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,860
is on A, which would then be 

54
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,740
applied here. 

55
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,880
B times HB is then, so A is equal to 

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,260
B times HB half, which means that we 

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,680
take B as the base side and 

58
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,400
then have the height above B, or 

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,320
from B, which would then be approximately 

60
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,100
as long here. And last but not least, A is 

61
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,700
equal to C times hc half. This is 

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,720
the case we see below. 

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
The triangle stands on its 

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,220
base side C and the height hc is 

65
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,880
drawn in. The heights are always 

66
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,640
perpendicular to the base side. So you 

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,660
can always draw a right 

68
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,700
angle here. And you can 

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,760
then 

70
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,420
calculate the area accordingly. The 
perimeter 

71
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,440
is, of course, 

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,940
much easier to 

73
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,360
determine , as we have already seen. 

74
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,950
Now let's take a look at the 

75
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,030
most important types of triangle. 

76
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,150
There is the equilateral triangle. 

77
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,170
As the 

78
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,450
name suggests, all 

79
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,010
sides of an equilateral triangle are 
equal. This means that all sides 

80
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,090
are the same length and therefore 

81
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,890
all angles are the same size, namely 

82
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,310
60 degrees. 

83
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,570
You should know that this is a 

84
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,230
very important triangle and is 

85
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,510

86
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,370
actually one of the simplest cases. There 
is also 

87
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,070
the isosceles triangle. In an isosceles 
triangle, 

88
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,750
only 

89
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,590
two sides are the same length. These are 
the 

90
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,270
so-called legs, in this case B and A. 

91
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,510
They are the same length and the angle 

92
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,290
to the base side, alpha and beta, is 

93
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,450
also the same. These are 

94
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,790
the two most important triangle shapes. 

95
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,210
However, isosceles triangles 

96
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,550
are more common than equilateral 
triangles. 

97
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:59,520
Lateral. Concurrence sets are 

98
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,160
used to 

99
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,780
uniquely determine triangles. 

100
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,920
This means that two 

101
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
triangles are said to be concurrent 

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,300
, i.e. equal, if certain 

103
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,180
concurrence theorems are true. 

104
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,600
This is the easiest 

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,520
way to express it. There are different 
ones, we 

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,640
have the competition theorem here. sss 

107
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,320
stands for side side side side which 

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,700
means we have three sides that we 

109
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,680
check we simply look to see if all 

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
three side lengths are equal if 

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
that is the case then the 

112
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,300
triangles are automatically competitive 
that 

113
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,080
means identical yes there are 

114
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,660
of course others for example 

115
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,360
here wsw which means angle side 

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
angle this competition theorem 

117
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,900
is about 

118
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,700
checking two angles and the included side. 

119
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,040
So you 

120
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,220
pick out the two angles , 

121
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,580
measure them - they really have to 

122
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,560
be measured - and check and 

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,860
measure the length of the enclosed 

124
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,000
side. This is compared with the 

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,340
triangle to be compared. This is similar 
to 

126
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,220
sws, i.e. side angle side, i. 

127
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,180
e. we have two sides and 

128
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,100
an included angle, i.e. 

129
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,420
we measure the lengths of the two sides 

130
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,620
and the size of the 

131
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,000
included angle and 

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,260
compare this again to the 

133
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,820
congruence as sw is side side 

134
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,260
angle side angle very important with 
these, it is 

135
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,760
not the included angle that is 

136
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,040
measured but the 

137
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,580
opposite side angle 

138
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,880
, i.e. the 

139
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,200
angle opposite the larger side . This is 

140
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,160
a bit complicated, 

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,320
you really have to memorize it. With 

142
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,420
the others, I think it was 

143
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,360
quite easy to remember. But 

144
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,740
here it's really like this: we've 

145
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,460
given two side lengths, which we 

146
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,860
measure again and also measure 

147
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,780
the angle opposite the larger 

148
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,190
side. As I said, this is very, 

149
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,250
very important. 

150
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,950
If an angle 

151
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,370
is opposite the smaller side , there is no 

152
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,950
competing set. That is very important. 

153
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,090
There are then attempts to 

154
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,070

155
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,290
express this special case using lower case 
letters , by 

156
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,550
making the second S lower case or even 

157
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,530
making the W lower case, simply to 

158
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,470
indicate that you 

159
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,030

160
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,890
have taken the angle opposite the smaller 
side . I would, however, 

161
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,550
always stick to the specified 

162
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,570
competing sets. 

163
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,660
That would be it for the 

164
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,640
competing sets. 

165
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,580
On the whole, you can simply 

166
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,540
say that you need them 

167
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,120
to prove that triangles 

168
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
are identical or that they compete 

169
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,460
with each other. And it is best 

170
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,400
to memorize them or know their 

171
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,220
meaning. We now come to a 

172
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,800
small example task. 

173
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,620
To be precise 

174
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,420
, it is an isosceles 

175
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,240
triangle, which is already clear from the 

176
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,620
task. And 

177
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,160
we are supposed to 

178
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,780
calculate the perimeter and the area. 

179
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,460
First of all, we see that we have side A 

180
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,960
with 7 cm and the base side C with 1.5 

181
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,520
cm, i.e. the C 

182
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,840
given here only extends to the 

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,700
center. In the case of an equilateral 
triangle 

184
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,360
, the apex 

185
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800

186
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,760
sits exactly in the middle above the base 
side and side B is of course 

187
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,000
just as long as side A. This is of 
equilateral triangle . This is 

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,140
the property of an equilateral 

189
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,300
triangle, which we 

190
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,900
have already learned. To 

191
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,420
calculate the area , large A, we 

192
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,240
naturally need the height HC. 

193
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,400
Fortunately , we have already given this , 
8 cm. 

194
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,760
And that's where we start now 

195
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,540
. First, we'll 

196
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,780
simply calculate the perimeter. The 
circumference 

197
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,420
was simply A plus B plus C, in 

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,100
this case C' because C only goes to 

199
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,580
the middle and C' is the entire 

200
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,820
length. We can simply 

201
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,320
calculate C' by 

202
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,820
multiplying C by 2 because, if you 

203
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,360
like, we have the 

204
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,300
length C here again 

205
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,900
. So C is 3 cm long. We know 

206
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,940
that A is equal to B with 7 cm and so 

207
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,020
we get the circumference. The 
circumference is 

208
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,060
7 plus 7 plus 3 centimeters, which 

209
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,080
makes 7 centimeters. We can therefore 

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,200
conclude that the perimeter of this 

211
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,500
isosceles triangle is 17 

212
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,880
centimetres. 

213
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,140
It is actually easier with the 

214
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,720
area. We have 

215
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,900
 already given the C -line, we 

216
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,160
always  need the entire length of the 

217
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,720
base side and the HC is also 

218
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,380
given. 

219
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,360

220
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,620
This means that we have given everything 
we need to insert here . so we 

221
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,040
simply insert the area of a is 

222
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,340
then equal to c line times hc line 

223
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,460
the hc line is simply the 

224
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,240
height that 

225
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,720
is on the base side c line so simply under 
hc so 

226
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,180
we get 3 x 8 cm divided by 2 that makes 12 

227
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,300
square centimetres 

228
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,200
so we now know that the area of this 

229
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,440
triangle is 12 square centimetres 

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,000
and that would also be 

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
the example task. So as I said, 

232
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,600
always pay attention to what kind of 

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
triangle it is 

234
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,200
. This is often stated in 

235
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
the task, as is the 

236
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
case here. And this is important 

237
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
information for solving the task 

238
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
. Otherwise it is often 

239
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,260
simply not possible to 

240
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,180
solve it. That's why the knowledge we' 

241
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,520
ve just looked at is 

242
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,360
important. 

243
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,060
That 

244
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,520
brings us to the end of the webinar. I 
hope you 

245
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
enjoyed it and 

246
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,820
were able to 

247
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,020
take something away from the webinar . 

248
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,760
In any case, thank you for your 

249
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,060
attention and 

250
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,680
have a nice evening.
