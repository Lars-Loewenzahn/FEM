00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,810
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,830
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,710
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 
explain 

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,970
something about the representation and 

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,470
properties of non-metals 

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,530
. In our online 

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,270
 learning center, you will 

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,650
of course also find a wiki on this topic 

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,890
, in which the 

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,610
basic and important terms 

11
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,210
are explained in more detail. First, 

12
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,110
let's take a look at how non-metals 

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,010
are divided into 

14
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,870
reactive non-metals, i.e. 

15
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,630
non-metals and halogens, and 

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,770
noble gases. As you may already 

17
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,910
know, noble gases are not reactive 

18
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,190
because they 

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,810
have already 

20
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,550
reached the optimal state, i.e. the noble 
gas configuration. 

21
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,350

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,030

23
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,910
A separate video on noble gas 
configuration is also available in our 
online learning center. The 

24
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,490
noble gas configuration occurs 

25
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,610
when an element 

26
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,450
has 8 outer electrons , as is the case 
with noble gases 

27
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,130
. All other elements that 

28
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,710
do not have this state 

29
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,730
from the outset strive for it. 

30
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,510
Non-metals can be solid or liquid 

31
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,910
, halogens are gaseous. Now 

32
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,250
let's take a look at where the non-metals 
are 

33
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,730

34
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,290
located in the periodic table . A general 
distinction is made 

35
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,750
in the periodic table between 

36
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,570
metals, semi-metals and 

37
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,930
non-metals. The non-metals 

38
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,910
are at the top right, except for 

39
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,910
hydrogen, as you 

40
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,230
can see from the diagram. In the diagram, 

41
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,830
the non-metals are green and the 

42
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,370
halogens, which we have just 

43
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,010
learned 

44
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,570
belong to the non-metals, are yellow. The 

45
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,310
noble gases are shown in 

46
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,690
dark blue in the diagram . Now 

47
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,390
let's take a look at the actual 

48
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,530
difference between metals and 

49
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,630
non-metals. Metals 

50
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,090
have the properties of high conductivity, 

51
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,950
high thermal conductivity, 

52
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,290
malleability and metallic 

53
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,310
luster. 

54
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,970
Non-metals lack these properties. 
Non-metals are very 

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,510
reactive, they have a high 

56
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,010
electronegativity. 

57
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,730
They take up electrons very easily, as 
they are only 

58
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,990
one electron short of the 

59
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,310
noble gas configuration, as you can see in 
the 

60
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,350
periodic table. condensed diode system 

61
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,750
. And as you 

62
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,250
may already know, the 

63
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,370
noble gas configuration 

64
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,430
is regarded as the optimum and is 
therefore 

65
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,570
aimed for by every element. As the 

66
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,510
non-metals are therefore close to 

67
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,370
achieving this, they make 

68
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,910
a special effort by 

69
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,930
being very reactive . Non-metals tend to 

70
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,070
form anions. Anions are negatively 

71
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,210
charged ions. They are formed 

72
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,410
when an atom accepts electrons. 

73
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,030
During electrolysis, anions migrate 

74
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,550
to the anode, i.e. the positive pole. 
Anions 

75
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,030
can 

76
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,570
be detected with the help of chemical 
reactions. 

77
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,270
Non-metals form an 

78
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,430
acidic solution with water. Non-metals 
form 

79
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,630
salts with metals. If you 

80
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,250
would like to find out more about this 

81
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,690
, you can 

82
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,870
watch a separate video. I hope I 

83
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,810
have been able to explain this topic to 
you. If you have 

84
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,810

or other topics, please feel free to use
