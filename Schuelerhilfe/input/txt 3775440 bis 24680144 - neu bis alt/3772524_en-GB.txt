00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,150
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,270
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,290
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,850
explain something about DNA to you. In our 

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,650
online learning center, you can 

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,150
of course also find a wiki on this topic 

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,550
, in which the 

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,250
basic and important terms 

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,150
are explained in more detail. Have you 

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,850
ever wondered what we 

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,270
humans are actually made of ? 

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,790
We will answer this question in this 

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,690
video. Our 

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,350
basic building block is our DNA. 

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,290
All genetic information is 

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,450
stored on it. It is, so to speak, a 

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,490
guide to our individual 

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,290
structure. This information 

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,030
determines our development, 

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,010
for example how we will 

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,990
look later on. But what does the 

22
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,770
abbreviation DNA actually stand for ? DNA 

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,950
stands for deoxyribonucleic acid or 

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,590
deoxyribonucleic acid 

25
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,430
or DNA. ZNES. For international 

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,690
simplification, however, the 

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,850
English abbreviation DNA is used. 

28
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,210
In eukaryotes, i.e. cells with a 

29
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,970
cell nucleus, such as 

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,550
animals, the DNA is 

31
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,730
mainly found in the chromosomes in the 

32
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,410
cell nucleus. In prokaryotes, cells 

33
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,950
without a nucleus, such as 

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,450
bacteria, it floats in the 

35
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,290
cytoplasm. But where exactly is 

36
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,930
our DNA located? DNA. 

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,050
It is located in our 

38
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,350
chromosomes. There it is 

39
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,550
wrapped around the histones, a protein. 
The 

40
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,930
unit of DNA and proteins 

41
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,950
is called chromatin. 

42
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,630
Now that you have learned what the 
abbreviation 

43
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,770
DNA actually means and where it is 

44
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,630
located, let's take a look at 

45
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,890
how DNA is structured. Our DNA 

46
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,710
consists of sugar, deoxyribose, 

47
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,210
phosphate and the four organic 

48
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,930
bases adenine, thymine, cytosine and 

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,050
guanine. The four bases are each 

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,390

51
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,650
abbreviated with their first letter. In 
simple terms, you could 

52
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,870
say that our DNA is structured like 

53
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,350
a rope ladder. The base adenine 

54
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,230
connects to the base thymine 

55
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,030
and the base cytosine 

56
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,190
connects to the base guanine. Only these 
two 

57
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,270
combinations are possible. Here 

58
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,630
you can see a simplified 

59
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,270
representation of DNA. This series 

60
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,970
can be continued indefinitely. 

61
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,530
Z stands for sugar, P for phosphate, A 

62
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,830
for adenine, T for thymine, C for 

63
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,470
cytosine and G for guanine. The sugar 

64
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,410
is shown as a pentagon, the 

65
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,330
phosphate usually as a circle. The bases 

66
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330
are given 

67
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,330
a 

68
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,610
shape at one end for better visualization 
, so that it is easier... 

69
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,670
recognize which two bases 

70
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,230
go together. The combination of 

71
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,930
base, sugar and phosphate is called 

72
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,710
a nucleotide. Now we know the 

73
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,730
simplified structure of our DNA. 

74
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,830
Now let's take a look at the more complex 

75
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,670
structure. Our DNA is 

76
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,370
structured like a spiral. This shape is 
called 

77
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,150
a helix. The word helix 

78
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,810
describes the helical shape. Our DNA is 

79
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,430
in a double helix. The 

80
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,350
individual strands of our DNA are 

81
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,930
connected by hydrogen bonding 

82
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,010
. 

83
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,790
You may 

84
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,350
already be familiar with hydrogen bonding 
from your chemistry lessons. 

85
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,890
As mentioned at the beginning, 

86
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,870
our DNA can be read by 

87
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,650
RNA polymerase. This separates the 

88
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,650
double strands of DNA and 

89
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,690
duplicates them in a molecule 

90
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,150
called RNA. During this 

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,310
process, thymine becomes uracil. All 

92
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,790
other bases remain the same. 

93
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,070
During cell growth and reproduction, 

94
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,290
DNA polymerase 

95
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,510
duplicates the DNA and 

96
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,450
passes it on to the new cell. I hope that 
you now 

97
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,710
know more about DNA. If you still have 

98
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,550
