00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,410
Hello, my name is Joshua and I 

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,470
am a tutor at 

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,350
Schülerhilfe. Today I would like to 

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,130

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,010
introduce you to the basics of mythosis 
and meiosis . 

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,450
Of course, you can find 

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,530

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,250
more learning content on this and many 
other topics in our online learning 
center. The basis 

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,490
of evolution is that animals 

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,550

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,750
can reproduce and develop further. The 
smallest dimension of this 

12
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,530
process is cell division. 

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,790
There are two different types 

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,710
of cell division. 

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,930
Mitosis and meiosis. 

16
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,910
Mitosis means that a 

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,010
cell divides into two further genetically 

18
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,890
identical cells. Prior to this, 

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,230
the cell is 

20
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,490
prepared for this during the S phase. This 
process 

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,110
only exists in eukaryotic cells. 

22
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,130
Meiosis, on the other hand, is a special 

23
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,770
type of cell division that 

24
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,810

25
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,310
occurs in germ cells, i.e. egg cells and 
sperm cells. In this process, the 

26
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,710
chromosomes are halved so that 

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,610
each germ cell only 

28
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,330
has half a set of chromosomes . This is 
important so that 

29
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,150

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,190
a single, 

31
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,930
complete set of chromosomes 

32
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,550
is produced when the egg and sperm cell 
fuse . In both mariosis 

33
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,770
and mythosis, the 

34
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,470
processes can 

35
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,730
be divided into different phases. In order 
for the cell to begin the 

36
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,410
process of mythosis 

37
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,710
, it must first 

38
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,710

39
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,770
duplicate the DNA and thus all the 
chromosomes during the S phase. The first 
phase of 

40
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,190
mitosis is called prophase. In 

41
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,670
this phase, the 

42
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,670
chromosomes condense and thus become 

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,870
visible. The spindle apparatus, which 

44
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,350
later separates the chromosomes from each 
other 

45
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,330
, is formed. This is followed by the 

46
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,910
prometaphase. Here, longitudinally 

47
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,470
divided chromosomes become visible. In 

48
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
metaphase, the chromosomes arrange 
themselves 

49
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,110
at the equatorial plane, i.e. in the 

50
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,150
middle of the cell. In 

51
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,610
the subsequent anaphase, the 

52
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,250
chromosomes, consisting of two 

53
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,770
chromatids 

54
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,130
, are separated using the spindle 
apparatus. The 

55
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,830
chromatids 

56
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,930
are pulled to both sides of the cell. In 
the 

57
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,970
final telophase 

58
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,650
, the two halves of the cell separate into 
two 

59
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,270
identical cells. The cell nucleus becomes 

60
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,110
visible again. 

61
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,010
not identical. Meiosis begins 

62
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,410
in the nucleus of the egg mother cell. In 

63
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,990
metaphase, the 

64
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,630
paired chromosomes assemble in the 

65
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,970
equatorial plane of the spindle apparatus. 

66
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,990
The subsequent anaphase 1 

67
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,590
is very different from the 

68
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,890
mitotic anaphase, whereas in 

69
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,970
mitosis one chromatid from each 

70
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,230
chromosome ends up in the new cell, 

71
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,390
so that it 

72
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,730
contains the complete genetic material of 
the mother cell, in 

73
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,770
meiosis the chromosome pairs are separated 

74
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,430
and 

75
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,030
pulled to both sides of the cell , so that 
either the 

76
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,750
paternal or the maternal 

77
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,750
chromosome with two chromatids each 

78
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,910
ends up in the daughter cell. 

79
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,430
In telophase 1, 

80
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,250
only one chromosome with 

81
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,950
two chromatids of each type is present at 
each pole. 

82
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,570
This means that the 

83
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,010
number of chromosomes has been reduced. 

84
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,330
This is followed by 

85
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,490
metaphase 2, anaphase 2 and 

86
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,590
telophase 2. This 

87
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,470
differs depending on whether 

88
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,690
an egg cell or sperm cell is formed. 

89
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,110
Finally, let's take another look 

90
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,690

91
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,510

92
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,290
at the differences between mithosis and 
mariosis . 

93
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,530
We have already 

94
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,790
recognized that the phases differ. The 
result of mithosis 

95
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,230
is two 

96
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,890
daughter cells that are identical to the 
mother cell. At the end of mariosis 

97
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,970
, on the other hand, four 

98
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,670

99
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,590
daughter cells are formed that are not 
identical to the mother cell and 

100
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,390

101
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,370
contain a random mixture of maternal and 
paternal chromosomes 

102
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,290
and not all the 

103
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,090
chromosomes of a maternal and 

104
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,690
paternal version like the mother cell. 

105
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,350
The functions of the two processes are 
also 

106
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,650
different. Mithosis serves to 

107
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,410
multiply the cells and thus to 

108
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,710
build up the body. Majosis 

109
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,270
, on the other hand, is used for sexual 

110
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,370
reproduction. During majosis 

111
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,170
, a so-called crossing-over can 

112
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,010
occur. This is actually an error 

113
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,970
in the separation of chromosomes, which 

114
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,230
leads to a part of the 

115
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,990
chromosome inherited from the mother 

116
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,270
jumping to the paternal chromosome and 
vice versa. 

117
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,130
This process leads to the 

118
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,910
recombination of genetic 

119
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,450
information and is an important 

120
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,950
part of sexual 

121
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,990
recombination, i.e. the creation 

122
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,250
of new, multiplied genetic material. 

123
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,330
This is particularly important in meiosis 

124
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,550
. In mithosis, 

125
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,610
crossing-over has less effect. 

126
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,390
Not all animal groups are 

127
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,150
able to reproduce sexually. 

128
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,210
Instead, they can 

129
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,210

130
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,390
reproduce parthenogenetically via cloning 
, for example . These 

131
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,930
animals include water fleas, 

132
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,670
aphids and some 

133
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,910
species of fish and lizards. I hope I have 
been able to 

134
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,950
help you 

135
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,670
better understand the processes of 
mithosis and maiosis. 

136
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,010
If you 

137
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,010
have any further questions about this or 
other topics, please take 

138
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,810
a look at our online learning center 

139
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,230
or contact your 

140
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,510
local student help center. See you 

141
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,070
next time!
