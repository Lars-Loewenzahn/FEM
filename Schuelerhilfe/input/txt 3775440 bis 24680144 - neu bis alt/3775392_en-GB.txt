00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello, my name is Sabrina and I 

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,940
am a tutor 

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,980
at Schülerhilfe. Today we are going to 

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,880

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,640
look at an important topic in chemistry. 
We will 

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,600
discuss what anions, cations and 

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,000
ionic bonds are and what 

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,220
structures they form. Of course, 

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,000

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,520
there is also a wiki available for this 
topic in our online learning center 

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,600
, in which the most important 

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,480
terms are explained to you once again. 

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,960
In order to understand what ionic bonds 

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,780
are and how they are formed, 

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,240
we first need to look at the charges in 

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,580
such a bond. 

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,360
In chemistry, a distinction is made 
between two 

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,800
types of charged particles, namely 

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,820
anions and cations. 

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,600
The anions are negatively charged. As 

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,940
a mnemonic, you can remember the N in 

22
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,160
anion for negative. Cations 

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,860
are positively charged. But how 

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,520
are such ions formed? Well, 

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,660
you've probably heard of the atomic model 

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,780
, which assumes 

27
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,780
that the electrons of an atom, 

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,200
which is normally uncharged, are 

29
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,480
arranged in shells around the nucleus 

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,220
. Atoms can, for example, 

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,880
accept an electron and 

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,140
a negative 

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,680
excess charge is created by the 

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,720
negatively charged 

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,200
particle, as you can see here in the 
example of 

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,860
chlorine and its chloride ion. 

37
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,400
This ion is then an anion. 

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,480
A 

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,620
minus sign is now added to the atom name 
to indicate this. 

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,720
Similarly, when 

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,000
an electron, i.e. a negative 

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
charge, is released, a positive 

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,560
excess charge is created and 

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,820
a cation is formed, such as the 

45
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,760
sodium ion in this example. Incidentally, 
the 

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,580
energy required to release an 

47
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,680
electron from an atom is called 

48
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,660
ionization energy. It is also important to 

49
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,840
know that ions 

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,720
are less stable than their atoms and are 
therefore 

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,820
more reactive. But what is 

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,720
ionic bonding all about? 

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,180
Ionic bonds are formed when 

54
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,460
cations and anions combine. 

55
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,600

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,940
It is logical that these two oppositely 
charged ions react with each other 
because, as you probably 

58
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,260
know, positive and negative charges 

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,520
attract each other. The force between the 

60
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
two is known as 

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
electrostatic attraction. In the 

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,700
example, you can see how the 

63
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,940
anion of chloride and the cation of 

64
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,480
sodium combine to form sodium chloride. 

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,660
This happens by forming an 

66
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,560
ionic bond. If you look at many 

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,880
sodium ions and many chloride ions 

68
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,020
together, 

69
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,120
they form a very specific pattern 

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,220
, namely a lattice. 

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,020
As you can see, there are always 

72
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,740
positive and negative charges 

73
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,100
next to each other, which 

74
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,720
attract each other. This is the 

75
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,840
most energetically favorable state for the 
molecule. 

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,620
This structure is quite solid and 

77
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,960
energy is required to detach a particle 

78
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,640
from this lattice. 

79
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,800
This energy is called 

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,140
lattice energy. It corresponds to the 

81
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,980
force that 

82
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,960
keeps the ions in the lattice . You may 
recognize the NaCl 

83
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,840
from our example. 

84
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,740
In chemical terms, our normal table salt 
is 

85
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,840
NaCl. Salts 

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,820
are the representatives of ionic bonds and 

87
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,340
form exactly these solid 

88
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,080
lattice structures that we 

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,520
have discussed. This is why salt is also a 

90
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,420
solid substance that forms crystals. 

91
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,520
They usually have relatively high 

92
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,200
boiling points and are soluble in 

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,600
water. In addition to NaCl, there are also 

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,820
other salts 

95
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,760
that are formed in the same way. Examples 

96
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,340
of this would be calcium carbonate or 

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,340
barium sulphate. I hope I 

98
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,660
have been able to help you understand what 
anion 

99
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,940
and cation are and what the typical 

100
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,620
bonds they form look like. 

101
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,720

or
