00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,840
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,420
Calculating Advantageously. 

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,800
In this webinar, we 

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,260
will talk about how to calculate 
advantageously 

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,600
. In other words, we'll 

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,300
start by looking at one or two 

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,220
calculation rules, including dot 

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,120
before dash. And then we'll look at 

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,400
how to make the work of 

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,820
calculation a little easier 

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,160
. In other words, we will look at how to 

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,500
add and 

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,020
subtract and how to 

14
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,100
multiply . At the very end, 

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,480
we also have another task 

16
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,540
where we 

17
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,420

18
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,660
want to apply these techniques once again 
in a task and teach them in this way. 
Let's start 

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,520
with the dot before the dash. I think 

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,200
everyone has heard the arithmetic rule 

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,300
, dot before 

22
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,120
dash. This means that you have to 

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,880

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,300

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,460
perform multiplication and division before 
addition and subtraction . 

26
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,720
So multiplication and division must 

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,280
be carried out before addition and 
subtraction. 

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,180
In other words, we have a small 

29
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,820
example task here . 2 times 3 plus 4. We 

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,680
have to carry out the multiplication, i.e. 
2 times 

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,140
3, first. 2 times 3 is 6, which means that 

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,620
the next step is 

33
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,480
6 plus 4. Only now that we 

34
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,140
have carried out the multiplication 

35
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,900
can we carry out the addition. 

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,980
6 plus 4 is then 10. The only 

37
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,980
thing above this rule is 

38
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,360
the bracket. If we 

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,340
have a bracket , we first have to 

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,260
calculate within the bracket. This means 
that if we 

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,320
have the example, 2 times parentheses 

42
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,940
open, 3 plus 4 parentheses closed, we must 

43
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,340
first 

44
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,500
calculate the value in the parentheses , 
i.e. 3 plus 4. 3 plus 4 

45
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,200
is 7, which means that in the 

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,800
next step we calculate 2 times 7 and that 

47
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,140
is 14. So it is very important to always 

48
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,580
work on the parentheses first. And if 

49
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,720
you have several brackets 

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,620
, start with the innermost bracket. When 

51
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,200
adding advantageously 

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,780
, it is easiest 

53
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,500
to add and subtract numbers that 

54
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,220
are even. In other words, they may 

55
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,820
have a lot of zeros. Here is 

56
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,060
a small example. 4831 plus 1468 

57
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,040
is quite difficult, but a 

58
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,880
number similar in size to 1468 

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,360
is 1000, i.e. 4831 plus 1000 is 

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
much easier to calculate 

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
than the former, because the latter is 

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,380
simply 5831, i.e. it depends 

63
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,620
less on the size of the number 

64
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,400
and more on the number of 

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,220
zeros it contains, i.e. the more 

66
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,220
zeros a number has, the easier 

67
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,060
it is to calculate. this applies not 

68
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,460
only to addition, but also 

69
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,600
later to multiplication. The 

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,420
technique behind this is that if 

71
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,040
I want to add several numbers, 

72
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,660
as here, I try to 

73
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,440
pick out numbers that add up to an 

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,880
even number. For example, 26 

75
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,940
plus 13 plus 7 plus 4. If I 

76
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,600

77
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,120
were to simply calculate from left to 
right , i.e. 26 plus 13, then plus 7, 

78
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,080
then plus 4, it would be difficult because 

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,420
I would never arrive at an even number. 

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,380
And that's why I try 

81
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,900
to group the numbers , because I can also 

82
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,080
calculate 26 plus 4 first. And you 

83
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,320
can already see that 26 plus 4 equals 30, 

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,600
which is an even number. That's why 

85
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,180
I start by calculating 

86
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,620
26 plus 4 first, which equals 30. 

87
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,600
And now we continue. Now 

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,540
we still have 13 plus 7, which means that 

89
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,100
instead of 

90
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,440
calculating 30 plus 13, I 

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,380
add the 30 and the 7 together. that's 20 
together 

92
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,100
and then calculate 30 

93
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,220
plus 20 quite comfortably . that's two 
even numbers 

94
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,100
and they add up to 

95
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,080
50. that means although i 

96
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,300
had to add four numbers here , it was 

97
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,040
quite comfortable because i 

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,260
formed even numbers first. 

99
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,360
of course that's not always possible, but 

100
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,960
here's another 

101
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,980
example i can decompose any number like 
this 

102
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,100
or decompose most of them in such a way 

103
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,920
that at least part of it is an 

104
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,060
even number, for example 75 

105
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,420
27 I can 

106
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,120
decompose 720 into 20 plus 7 that means I 
can first 

107
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,920
calculate 75 plus 20 and then 

108
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,120
plus 7 that makes it a bit 

109
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,820
easier because then I 

110
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,380
only have a transition of 10 

111
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,740
75 plus 20 is 95 and 95 plus 7 is 

112
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,340
102. And that's easier 

113
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,140
to calculate than 75 plus 27. That's 

114
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,940
just the trick. If you 

115
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,020
have problems adding or 

116
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,660
perhaps subtracting something , then 

117
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,940
you first subtract with an 

118
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,640
even number or in this case add 

119
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,480
with an even number, i.e. with the 

120
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,040
tens only. 

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,560
Smooth numbers are, of course, those 

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,620
that end in zeros, i.e. 10, 20, 

123
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,320
50, 100, 1000, 10,000 and so on. 

124
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,600
Numbers that end in 5 are also 

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,520
often helpful, because then 

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,740
the 

127
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,600
numbers that are easy to 

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,940
work with expand a little. 

129
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,560
For example, 25 plus 25 equals 50 or 75 
plus 25 

130
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,740
equals 100, which is also 

131
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,520
a good way of doing maths. 

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,760
In any case, it is always good to 

133
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,560
form pairs of numbers that add up to an 
even number 

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
. For example, 1 plus 9 equals 

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,560
10, 2 plus 8 equals 10, 3 plus 7 

136
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,680
equals 10, 4 plus 6 equals 10 and 5 

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,760
plus 5 also equals 10. This is 

138
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
always good if you 

139
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,300
can somehow add them together to 

140
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,800
create an even number. 

141
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,940
Of course, this also works if, for 
example, you 

142
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,960
add 24 plus 6 here, which is then 30, 
which 

143
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,240
is of course also an even number. 

144
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,000
And then we come to 

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
a small example. 

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800

147
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,820
We can of course also 

148
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,240
apply these tips to a subtraction, as we 
have 

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
just mentioned. And here we have 

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,360
the example of 332 minus 53. First, 

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
we can 

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,820
write the minus 53 as minus 50 and then 
minus 3. 

153
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,680
This means that we then have 332 minus 50 

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
minus 3. And of course we start 

155
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
by 

156
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
doing the calculation with the even 
number, in this case 

157
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,640
the minus 50. 332 

158
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,660
minus 50 is then 282 The nice thing 

159
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,960
is that we don't calculate in the 

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,220
ones, we only calculate in the 

161
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,640
tens That's why calculating with 

162
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,940
even numbers is so easy And now 

163
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,620
we only have to calculate minus 3 

164
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,560
And 282 minus 3 is 279 That's 

165
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,620
much easier to calculate than 

166
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,700
if we 

167
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,320
had subtracted the 53 at the beginning Of 
course, this 

168
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,680
also works , if you 

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,040
subtract with several numbers as 214 minus 
60 the 4-35 

170
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,600
similar to 

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,700
the action , it makes sense to 

172
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,840
see which pairs of numbers lead to an 

173
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
even number or which 

174
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,000
calculation we don't have to calculate 
from 

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,420
left to right we can 

176
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,520
also calculate 214 minus four first 

177
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,880
because 214 minus four gives 210 that's 

178
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,180
an even number we can 

179
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,880
continue to calculate straight away or 

180
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,060
calculate more easily we arrive at 210 

181
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,900
minus 60 minus 35 next, 

182
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,320
of course, we continue with the minus 60 

183
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,680
because we have an even number here 

184
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,860
and an even number there that's 

185
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,000
wonderful so we can 

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,900
calculate nice and easily that's then 

187
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,480
150 and then we now have 150 

188
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,360
minus 30 minus 5 we can 

189
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,120
also 

190
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,380
divide the 35 into minus 30 and minus 5 
the same as we did 

191
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,680
above here 

192
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,600
we have also divided the 53 into 50 and 3 

193
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
we do the same here then we can 

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,500

195
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,840
subtract 150 minus 

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,040
30 120 again with a smooth number and now 
we 

197
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,140
only have to subtract five from the 120 
this is then 

198
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,740
115 with such techniques you can 

199
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,560

200
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,900

201
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,500
carry out apparently complex calculations 
very efficiently even without tools this 
also means that 

202
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,340
such multiple subtractions are 

203
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,700
then no longer a problem, if you 

204
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,540
calculate skillfully. Of course, you can 

205
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,000
also do such calculations in writing. 

206
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,530
Now let's move on to advantageous 

207
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,130
multiplication. Advantageous 

208
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,650
multiplication is similar to 

209
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,070
advantageous addition. 

210
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,630
It's easiest to work with even 

211
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,550
numbers, as we see 

212
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,170
an example here of 5 times 7 times 2. It' 

213
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,030
s always best to look for 

214
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,690
pairs of numbers that multiply to an 

215
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,970
even number, preferably 

216
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,530
10 of course. Because if I were to 

217
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,610
start on the left again, 

218
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,970
I would calculate 5 times 7 times 2. 

219
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,970
But I can also go and 

220
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,010
calculate 5 times 2 first , because then I 
have a 

221
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,290
10, which is much easier, and 

222
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,290
then it says 10 times 7. Whenever 

223
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,250
we 

224
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,490
multiply by a power of 10 , we go and 

225
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,070
simply 

226
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,530
add 0 to the second number , or the number 
of zeros 

227
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,830
that our power of 10 also has. 

228
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,110
This means that in this case we have a 

229
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,200
zero and 10 times 7 is 70. 

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,460
Of course, you can also 

231
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,080
do it the other way round. If 

232
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,700
the numbers get bigger, you can 

233
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,320
also break them down into smaller 

234
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,940
numbers. This means that 8 times 15 is the 

235
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,760
same as 2 times 4 times 3 times 5. 

236
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,900
Why? I can break down the 8 into 2 times 4 

237
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,380
, because 2 times 4 is 8. And 

238
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,880
I can break down the 15 into 3 times 5. 

239
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,160
In this case, 3 times 5 is 15, so 

240
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,380
I can now 

241
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
choose pairs of numbers that together 

242
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,900

243
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,680
make an even number or preferably a power 
of ten. Here, of course, we have 

244
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,140
2 times 5, which gives us 10 again. 

245
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
And then we have 4 times 3, which 

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,240
gives us 12. And 10 times 12 is again 

247
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,660
easy to calculate, because that is 

248
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,760
120. So this number 10, when we 

249
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,900
multiply by it, has a very 

250
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,380
elementary meaning, because it is 

251
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,800
extremely advantageous. 

252
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,360
Here we have 

253
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,340
another example , pairs of numbers that 

254
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,780
result in a smooth product, i.e. that 

255
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,020
multiplied together 

256
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,340
result in a smooth number, 2 times 5 is 
10, 4 times 5 

257
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,660
is 20, 6 times 5 is 30 and 8 times 5 

258
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,280
is 40, 10 times 5 is 50. 

259
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,380
Of course, you can also break it down 
again in this way, 

260
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,380
we can also represent the 20 

261
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,940
using 2 times 10 or the 30 using 3 times 

262
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,600
10. And of course you can do the 

263
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,420
same with the 40 , 4 times 10 and the 50 5 
times 10. 

264
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,700
So you could 

265
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,040
also 

266
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,540
create a power of 10 from these even 
numbers and 

267
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,640
make it a bit easier with the zeros . 

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
Of course, it is just as important to 

269
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480

270
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,660
be able to break numbers down into their 
factors. We have just 

271
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,840
seen that. 

272
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,460
For example, we can divide 6 into 3 times 
2. 

273
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,080
We can break down the 8 into 2 times 4 

274
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,360
We can also 

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,160
break down the 12 into 3 times 4 And we 
can 

276
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,060
break down the 4 again into 2 times 2 This 
means that 

277
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,580
12 is the same as 3 times 2 times 2 

278
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,200
We can 

279
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,540
break down the 36 into 2 times 18 And we 
can then 

280
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,440
break down the 18 again into 2 times 9 
This means 

281
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,160
that we can represent the 36 by 2 

282
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,220
times 2 times 9 Or 2 times 2 is 4 

283
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,480
so that's also four times 

284
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,400
nine or we can also 

285
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,140
divide the new one into three so four 
times 

286
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,220
three times three or the two can also 

287
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,600
be divided into two so two times two 

288
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,220
times three times three so there are 

289
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,420
many possibilities yes what you 

290
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,740
take from this depends of course depends 
on 

291
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
what kind of number we 

292
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,460
want to multiply with and with which 

293
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
numbers I then 

294
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,960
come to such an even number it 

295
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,780
only depends on that the whole thing we 
can 

296
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,080
now see once here we 

297
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,360
now have a small task here 

298
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,720
and that is 87 plus 7 plus 33 times two 

299
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
first of all here is now very important 

300
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,120
point before dash we have no 

301
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
brackets in the first task therefore 

302
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,220
here really point before dash 

303
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,020
and before we calculate anything 

304
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,600
we calculate 33 times two that is 66 

305
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
now we only have 

306
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,520
one addition here or several 

307
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,620
additions and therefore we can then 

308
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,940
also add. So we now have 

309
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,720
87 plus 4 plus 3 plus 66. And now 

310
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,380
we can see that the 7 and the 3 

311
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,660
give me an even number again. 

312
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
It is therefore advantageous to add 87 
plus 3 

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,340
. And the 4 and the 6 

314
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,980
also make an even number. 

315
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,000
It is therefore advantageous to 

316
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,400
calculate the 4 plus 66 first. 87 plus 3 
equals 

317
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,540
90. 66 plus 4 equals 70. Now we have 

318
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,460
90 plus 70. This 

319
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,780
means that we are adding two 

320
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,680
even numbers again , which is quite 

321
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,300
simple. We now only have to 

322
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,060
calculate in tens. 90 plus 70 

323
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,360
is then 160. 

324
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,050
It's similar here with this slightly 

325
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,210
more complex task. Here we have 5 

326
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,350
plus parenthesis on 4 plus 10 times 21 
times 

327
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,410
parenthesis on 10 minus 8 parenthesis to 

328
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,450
parenthesis closed. So, we now have 

329
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,830
the example mentioned above, where we 

330
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,090
even have two brackets. That's why 

331
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,610
we start with the innermost bracket 

332
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,770
. Although there is a multiplication here 

333
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,470
, we are multiplying with 

334
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,750
the parenthesis. And we 

335
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,970
learned at the beginning that the 
parenthesis is 

336
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,690
still above the dot before the dash. 
Therefore, 

337
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,190
first 

338
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,550
determine the value in the bracket. This 
is 10 minus 8, i.e. 

339
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,690
2. However, we can then 

340
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,570
divide 21 into 3 times 7. This 

341
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,810
might make multiplication 

342
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,850
a little easier. Let's have a look 

343
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,890
. And we get from 4 plus 10 

344
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,910
times 3 times 7 times 2 to 4 plus 70 times 

345
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,370
6. So we first 

346
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,490
calculated 10 times 7 , which results in 
an 

347
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,770
even number 70. No matter what we 

348
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,090
would have multiplied the 10 by here, it 

349
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,030
would always have 

350
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,290
resulted in an even number. But 

351
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,490
of course we take the largest number to 
make 

352
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,770
it... easier. Because 10 times 7 

353
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,770
is 70 and 3 times 2 is only 6. 

354
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,150
This means that from the two numbers 

355
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,830
that we 

356
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,170
can 't make an even number out of, we 
naturally take the 

357
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,710
two smallest and 

358
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,370
multiply the largest by 10. 

359
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,250
This gives us 70 times 6. So before 

360
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,390
we 

361
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,390
do anything with the 5 here at the 
beginning, we just do the maths in the 

362
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,150
brackets first. We now have 

363
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,110
4 plus 70 times 6 here , so we 

364
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,350
still have a multiplication 

365
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,810
in there and a dot before a dash, 

366
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,750
so we can't 

367
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,810
do the addition. First we have to 

368
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,430
calculate 70 times 6, that's 420. 

369
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,010
And now we have 4 

370
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,630
plus 420 in the parenthesis. We 

371
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,030
now carry out this addition. Fortunately 

372
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,950
, 420 is an even number, which means it' 

373
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,550
s quite easy. Then we 

374
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,190
come to 424. Now it just says 

375
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,110
5 plus 424 and 5 plus 424 is 429 

376
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,950
and that's our 

377
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,130
result. That brings us to the end of the 

378
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,850
webinar. Thank you very much 

379
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,270
for your attention.
