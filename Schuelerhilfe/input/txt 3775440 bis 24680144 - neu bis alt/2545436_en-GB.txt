00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,900
Surface areas. 

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,000
In this webinar , we will be looking at 
these 

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,860
figures. 

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,060
First of all, we will describe what their 

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,740
special features are. And 

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,160
then we will 

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,640
briefly 

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,800
derive the formula for the area and 

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,960
illustrate how they 

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,880
fit together or what the 

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
thought process behind them is. We will 

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,140
first look at the rectangle, 

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,720
then the parallelogram, then the 

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,060
triangle, then the trapezoid and 

16
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,720
finally the kite square and 

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,800
the rhombus. And we'll start 

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,460
directly with the rectangle. 

19
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,820
A rectangle is characterized 

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,360
by the fact that the opposite edges 

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,660

22
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,080
are always the same length and parallel to 
each other. At the same time, you 

23
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,780
only have right angles. The area of 

24
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,220
a rectangle is calculated as 

25
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,200
a equals a times b. 

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,260
The reasoning behind this is simple. A 

27
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,240
is the length of the rectangle and B 

28
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,280
is the width or the height, depending on 

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,020
how you want to say it. And when we 

30
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,680
calculate the area, i.e. A 

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,580
is equal to A times B, we are 

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,360
actually doing nothing more than 

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,760
calculating how many squares we 

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
can get in there with one 

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,500
unit of area. We could 

36
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,760
also determine the area by 

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,400
going there, we know that there are 8 

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,860
units of length or let's say 8 cm 

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,000
, we now draw boxes 

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,060
with 1x1 cm everywhere , we then get 8 

41
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,320
pieces in a row and a total of 4 

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,580
pieces and 4 on top of each other in 
there, 

43
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,220
which means we have a total of 4x8 

44
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,760
boxes in there and that is 32 the 

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,400
area is therefore 32 cm² 

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,440
and with this form formula A times 

47
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,240
B we do nothing else. And that brings us 

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,260
to the 

49
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,680
parallelogram. The formula for the 

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,540
rectangle will be 

51
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,400
with us for a long time, because almost 
all solids 

52
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,860
can 

53
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,100

54
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,320

55
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,500
be converted back into a rectangle or a 
parallelogram by multiplying and cutting 
them up. 

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,240
But 

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,300
we can now see the connection to the 
parallelogram, because 

58
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,680
we are looking at a 

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
parallelogram here. A parallelogram 

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
is characterized by the fact that the 

61
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,940
opposite sides 

62
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,920
are always parallel and of equal length. 
But 

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
unlike a rectangle, we 

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
no longer need to have right angles. This 

65
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,100
means that B is parallel to B, A is 

66
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,180
parallel to A and A is of course as 

67
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,080
long as A and B is also as 

68
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,800
long as B. But we 

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,020
no longer have any right angles here. 

70
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,320

71
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,500
There are two formulas for calculating the 
area of a parallelogram : a 

72
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,120
times ha and b times hb. The difference 

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,560
is as follows. The height is always 

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,860
applied at right angles to the base side. 
This is always the case. Whenever 

76
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,480
you 

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,080
calculate a height in geometry , it is 
always perpendicular 

78
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,100
to the base side that we are 

79
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,580
looking at. So the two edges 

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,860
must always be perpendicular to each other 

81
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,060
and ha is simply the height 

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,060
that is perpendicular to a. HB would be 

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,700
the height that is perpendicular to B. 

84
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,780
It should somehow run like this. And 

85
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,960
then, of course, it depends on what 

86
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,480
I have given. If I have given A and HA 

87
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,780
, I naturally take the 

88
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,220
formula and if I 

89
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,460
have given B and HB , I take the latter. 
But 

90
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,880
let's move on to where do these 

91
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,880
formulas come from? First of all, we can 

92
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,540

93
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,220
turn any parallelogram into a rectangle by 
a simple transformation 

94
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,360
. 

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
To do this, let's label it again very 

96
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,420
briefly. Remember, we have 

97
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,020
the edge length A here, the 

98
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,060
edge length B here and that's HA. 

99
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,600
It is very important that we now have HA 
here 

100
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,680
and HA is perpendicular to A. 

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,780
Now we simply go and 

102
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,480
cut off our parallelogram at 

103
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,780
one corner. Important, at right angles. 

104
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,820
So here is a right angle. And 

105
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,900
now we take this corner off and 

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,600

107
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,560
put it back on the other side. So this is 
the corner that 

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,160
we cut off. And we 

109
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,340
see that we now have a 

110
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,900
rectangle. The question is, what are 

111
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
the dimensions of this rectangle? The 
rectangle 

112
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,400
has the length A and the height 

113
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,900
HA. 

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,020
And therefore, if we now 

115
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,200
use HA for our B, we go from a is 

116
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,960
equal to a times b to a is equal to ha and 

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,800
therefore we can 

118
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
always use this formula to 

119
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,920
calculate the area of a parallelogram 
because we 

120
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,340
haven't added anything, 

121
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,300
we've just 

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,940
cut off an area and added it 

123
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,340
back on the other side, 

124
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,540
i.e. we haven 

125
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,220
't changed the area content, just the 
appearance as 

126
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,180
you can see again we've 

127
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,080
cut here and we have 

128
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,860
simply attached this knowledge here and 

129
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,360
then come to this rectangle the figures 

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,900
are different one is a 

131
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,100
parallelogram as I said the other is a 

132
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,760
rectangle but we can 

133
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,780
calculate the areas using the formula 

134
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,560
because we 

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,470
have successfully reshaped it so we are 
already at 

136
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,070
the triangles 

137
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,890
and it is similar with the triangles first 
of all 

138
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,110
the area content for a triangle 

139
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,710
is 1,5 a times ha which means 

140
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,710
that here again we have the height 

141
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,530
ha which must of course be perpendicular 
to 

142
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,870
the side, this index here 

143
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,450
indicates that this is the height that 

144
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,010
is on A , as it 

145
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,150
was with the parallelogram and depending 
on 

146
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,610
what you have now given here, 

147
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,610
you can of course also 

148
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,330
use the other two formulas, i.e. 1.5 times 
B times HB 

149
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,690
or 1.5 times C times HC. As 

150
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,130
I said, this depends on what sides we 

151
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,510
have been given and what 

152
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,570
height, and we have 

153
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,210
now entered this triangle and want to 

154
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,730
derive these formulas 

155
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,410
, so we will 

156
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,790
limit ourselves to these. The derivation 
for the 

157
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,750
others works in the same way. 

158
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,250
First of all, we can 

159
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,610

160
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,330
create a parallelogram from a triangle by 
transforming it. And we'll 

161
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,730
just go to the base here, 

162
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,990
or we'll transform it into a 

163
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,850
parallelogram and then 

164
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,030

165
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,890
apply the formula for the parallelogram . 
We have just 

166
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,290
shown where the formula for the 

167
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,650
parallelogram comes from. We could 

168
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,090

169
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,670
of course also turn this triangle into a 
rectangle 

170
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,190
. But we're 

171
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,070
not going to do that now , because that 
would be a bit 

172
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,490
too much. Well, first 

173
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,090
we'll try to turn this triangle 

174
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,150
into a parallelogram. 

175
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,610
We do this by 

176
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,090
mirroring the triangle. Just to remind you 

177
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,030
, the height HA is the 

178
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,890
distance from the extended 

179
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,850
base side, if you like, 

180
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,210
to the tip. So the height doesn't 

181
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,530
always have to be inside the figure, it 
can 

182
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,390
also be outside. As here, 

183
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,890
you take a dashed 

184
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,110
line so that you 

185
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,930
can measure or draw the height correctly. 

186
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,770
And again, the height must 

187
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,150
be perpendicular to it. And 

188
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,670
first, we 

189
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,230
simply double our triangle . In other 
words, we have 

190
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,030

191
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,650
drawn this triangle next to it again in 
exactly the same way. And now we're going 
to rotate 

192
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,390
it. So I'll show that again 

193
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,830
very briefly. The edge moves up. 

194
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,030
We rotate it 180 degrees 

195
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,610
clockwise. And now it's lying 

196
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,230
here like this. I think you can already 
see 

197
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,290
what we're going to do. We're going to 

198
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,150
push this triangle onto it right now 

199
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,590
and get a 

200
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,970
parallelogram. So as I said, this 

201
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,030
is still the division when you see 

202
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,710
that there are two triangles. And now 

203
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,650
we can see that 

204
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,710
these two triangles together form a 

205
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,910
parallelogram. a is again parallel 

206
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,770
to a and c is again parallel to c. 

207
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,830
This means that the criteria for a 

208
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,770
parallelogram have 

209
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,370
been retained . We still have the 

210
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,030
height ha. That is still the 

211
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,810
point here. And the parallelogram 

212
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,350
now has a length of a. 

213
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,530
Of course, you can 

214
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,310
do this in several ways. Instead of 
putting the 

215
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,730
triangle on top here , we could have 

216
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,110
put this on top. 

217
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,030
then our parallelogram would have 

218
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,670
looked like this there are, as I said, 

219
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,110
several possibilities we could 

220
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,050
also 

221
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,410
transform the triangle not into a 
parallelogram 

222
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,930
but into a trapezoid that also worked 

223
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,190
but is not necessarily 

224
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,670
recommended I would always 

225
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,470
recommend that you simply 

226
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,410
transform it into a parallelogram 

227
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,590
as it is shown here and 

228
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,050
then you can 

229
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,630
calculate it accordingly see here we also 
have 

230
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,650
two cases here on the left that are, as 

231
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,210
I said, two different transformations 

232
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,650
we have once here the shorter 

233
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,250
side packed together and here 

234
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,730
we have the so on the right we have 

235
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,430
packed the longest side together 

236
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,710
then the appearance changes a 

237
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,630
bit the area content 

238
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,090
does not change because we 

239
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,690
still have the length a here and the 

240
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,730
length h here and here we 

241
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,760
now have the height HA and here A. Here 

242
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
you can also see that the 

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,580
height is in the figure and 

244
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,020
next to the figure, simply because you 

245
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,830
can't draw it in. 

246
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,070
A is the length of this parallelogram 

247
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,350
and HA is the corresponding height. 

248
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,570
The area of this whole 

249
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,330
parallelogram would then be A times 

250
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,310
HA. What is also very important here is 
that 

251
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,610
we have 

252
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,970
doubled our triangle . So this is twice 

253
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,310
the triangle of which we 

254
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,030
are to calculate the area . 

255
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,870
This means that if we 

256
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,230
want to find the area of a triangle, 

257
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,790
we have to 

258
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,610
divide the total area by 2. Therefore, a 

259
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,210
times ha, which 

260
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,850
is for 2 of the triangles, becomes 1.5 
times a times ha for 1 

261
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,270
of the triangles. Whether you 

262
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,150
multiply by 1.5, i.e. 0.5, or 

263
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,570
divide by 2 is the same. 

264
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,390
This 1.5 ensures that the 

265
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,690
area is halved And so 

266
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,910
we arrive at this shape This brings 

267
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,110
us to the trapezoid The trapezoid 

268
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,730
is characterized by the fact that it 

269
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,850
has two parallel sides Side A 

270
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,230
is parallel to side C And we 

271
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,750
can already see that there are 

272
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,470
actually no other criteria The two 

273
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,230
sides here do not have to 

274
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,670
be the same length A distinction is made 
between 

275
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,070
the general trapezoid and a 

276
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,950
symmetrical trapezoid In 

277
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,370
symmetrical trapezoids, the 

278
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,510
two sides are the same length. 

279
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,810
However, we are now dealing with the 

280
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,650
general trapezoid. However, you can 

281
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,830
of course also 

282
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,270

283
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,690
calculate the symmetrical trapezoid using 
the formula for the general trapezoid . So 
we 

284
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,570
simply assume that A is parallel 

285
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,750
to C. Of course, they are 

286
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,030
not the same length. And we now have the 

287
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,250
formula, the area purity A 

288
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,510
is calculated as 1.5 times A plus C. 

289
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,530
And we now go and try to 

290
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,490
borrow this. 

291
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,530
There is also the alternative formula a is 
equal to m 

292
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,670
times h. m is this center line here. 

293
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,110
And h, as I said, is the height of the 

294
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,090
trapezoid. In this case, there is no 

295
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,610
indication, because a trapezoid only has 
one 

296
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,290
height. Yes, this is the one here. 

297
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,990
Right, let's get started. 

298
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,510
Again, we want to 

299
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,030
create a parallelogram. That is, 

300
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,290
a parallelogram from this trapezoid. 

301
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,430
And I'll repeat it again. 

302
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,930
As I said, A is the length of the bottom 
side. 

303
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,090
C is the length of the top side. These 

304
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,770
are both parallel to each other. 

305
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,330
But they are different lengths. B and D 

306
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,470
are the lengths of the sides. They 

307
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,510
do not have to be the same length. They 
are only the 

308
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,190
same 

309
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,830
length in a symmetrical trapezoid . And H 
is the height of our 

310
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,870
trapezoid. To turn our trapezoid into a 

311
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,850
parallelogram 

312
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,470
, we first mirror the trapezoid. So 
mirroring 

313
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,610
really means that we 

314
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,270
mirror it here and that it 

315
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,450
is now mirror-inverted. We can see that 

316
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,950
side D is suddenly on the left 

317
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,610
and side B on the right 

318
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,550
. That is very important. It 

319
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,210
really has to be mirrored. And now 

320
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,210
we turn it or flip the 

321
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,130
mirrored trapezoid over. And now 

322
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,890
we can see here again that we 

323
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,190
have sides D 

324
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,250
lying next to each other. And down here we 

325
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,810
now also have A and C and C and A. 

326
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,090
So now we push them 

327
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,890
together like this and you can see that we 
have 

328
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,470
a parallelogram. This is 

329
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,730
very elongated, but it is a 

330
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,750
parallelogram. We have 

331
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,470
the side length C plus A at the top and 
bottom. Whether 

332
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,030
we 

333
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,670
have C plus A or A plus C doesn't matter. 
Both are 

334
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,190
the same length and we had, 

335
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,430
or it is the case with a trapezoid, 

336
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,750
that the sides 

337
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,930
are always parallel to each other . This 
means that C and A and A 

338
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,410
and C are also parallel to each other. 

339
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,930
In other words, we now really have a 

340
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,910
parallelogram. A and C is then the 

341
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,370
length of this new parallelogram 

342
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,050
and the height is still our 

343
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,530
height H. You can also see that here, 

344
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,710
it appears here again, 

345
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,610
but it is still our height. 

346
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,370
The 

347
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,800
formula 1.5 A plus C times h for the 

348
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,460
area of a trapezoid arises 

349
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,040
from the fact that we could 

350
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,680

351
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
now calculate the area of this resulting 
parallelogram 

352
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,840
using the formula for the 

353
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,440
parallelogram, i.e. length times height, 

354
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,120
which in our case means a plus c times h. 

355
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,780
It is very important to always 

356
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,580
write this a plus c in brackets, also here 
in the 

357
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,280
final formula, otherwise only 

358
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,960
the c or the a will be multiplied. 

359
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Therefore, we arrive at a plus c in 

360
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,600
brackets times h and that is again 

361
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,500
for the whole parallelogram. And the 

362
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,820
whole parallelogram consists of 

363
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,780
two trapezoids. So the same as 

364
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,720
we just had with the triangles 

365
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,820
, because we have mirrored it, i.e. 

366
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,020
multiplied it. So we use 

367
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,840
this formula above to calculate the area 

368
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
of two trapezoids. 

369
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
Of course, we only ever want to 

370
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,260
calculate the area for one trapezoid. 

371
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,060
That 's why this factor of 1 is half 
again, 

372
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,260
because we still have to divide by 2. 

373
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,060
As I just said, 

374
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,460

375
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,720
it doesn't matter whether we multiply by 1 
half or divide by 2 . It's the same. 

376
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,600
And so the formula for a 

377
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,060
parallelogram is 1 half times a plus c 

378
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,020
times h. 

379
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,820
And that 

380
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,720
explains the formula. 

381
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,210
Let's move on to the second formula. 

382
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,910
Alternatively, there was the formula a 

383
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,930
is equal to m times h. As already 
mentioned, M is 

384
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,850
the center line and H is the height. And 

385
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,890
this center line is exactly in the 

386
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,390
middle between C and A or A and C. 

387
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,510
And the length of this center line, 

388
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,690
i.e. the complete, if we now 

389
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,930
look at the parallelogram, here 

390
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,970
it is completely through A plus C. 

391
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,070
This is related to the 

392
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,710
parallelogram. The two edges 

393
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,230
are parallel to each other. consequently, 

394
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,470
if we always 

395
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,270
measure parallel to the base side , the 
distance is 

396
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,650
the same at every point, so even if 

397
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,730
we 

398
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,170
were to draw a line here , it would be 
just 

399
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,330
as long here at the top, it would also be 
just as 

400
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,650
long as a plus c, i.e. the 

401
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:17,010
center line is twice as long as a plus c 

402
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,750
, which is dashed here, or in other 

403
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,170
words, the center line of a 

404
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,290
parallelogram that ends here 

405
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,990
is 1.5 times a plus c. 

406
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,700
And that 

407
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:29,980
' s actually it. 

408
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,240
We have a line that is 1.5 times a plus 

409
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,180
c. And we still have the height 

410
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,040
h. And therefore 1.5 times a plus c is 

411
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,060
exactly the part. And that's how you get 
from 

412
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,440
the formula to m times h. So I'll go 

413
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,280
back for a moment. The center line 

414
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,800
is 1.5 times a plus c. In other words, we 

415
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,340
now 

416
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,300
enter m into the formula for this one and 
a half times a plus c 

417
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,800
and then we get the formula. 

418
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,300
That's where this comes from, i.e. if you 

419
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,600

420
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,500
are given the length of the center line 
and the height, always use the 

421
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,680
formula. And as I said, the 

422
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,640
center line lies exactly between the 

423
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,140
base side and the side above it. 

424
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,660
So it divides the height h into exactly 

425
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,020
two equal parts. 

426
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,430
This brings us to the 

427
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,110
kite quadrilateral. The kite quadrilateral 

428
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,130
is a special quadrilateral 

429
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,210
, as it has two diagonals 

430
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,630
that intersect at right angles. 

431
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,010
The area of the kite quadrilateral 

432
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,830
is calculated as a is equal to 1 

433
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,130
half times e times f. 

434
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,630
As already mentioned, e and f are the two 
diagonals. And 

435
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,630
we can 

436
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,470

437
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,970
turn any kite quadrilateral into a 
rectangle by transforming it. And e and f 
are the 

438
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:56,710
two diagonals. are, as I said, 

439
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,970
the two diagonals of the 

440
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,230
kite square. So, these diagonals 

441
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,530
intersect 

442
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,450
at right angles. And now we go 

443
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,050
and first double our 

444
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,230

445
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,670
kite shape and then we cut the kite shape 

446
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,550

447
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,450
apart along the diagonals, i.e. along E 
and F. Then we have triangles . Then we 
have four 

448
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,670
such triangles. And the triangle 

449
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,050
here is exactly what we 

450
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,270
have here. The triangle is exactly what 

451
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,970
we have here. Perhaps one more thing... 

452
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,490
something about the kite finch in general. 

453
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,750
This vertical diagonal E is 

454
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,170
also a line of symmetry. 

455
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,910
In other words, the triangle here is the 
same 

456
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,110
size as this and the triangle here is 

457
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,830
the same size as this. And 

458
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,170
now we take 

459
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,630

460
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,170
the triangles from our multiplied kite 
finch, which we have cut apart , and 

461
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,170
place them on the triangles of our 

462
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,110
kite finch. So we place them in front of 
it 

463
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,410
and then we fold them 

464
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,350
in here like this and we see that 

465
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,490
the triangles we have just 

466
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,730
cut apart are always the 

467
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,910
outer ones and we see that we have now 

468
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,950
created a rectangle let's take 

469
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,210
another quick look at the 

470
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,530
actual kite 

471
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,710
path the actual kite path the one 

472
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,730
diagonal the e is measured from here 

473
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,050
below to here above that is 

474
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,990
now exactly the height of our 

475
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,290
rectangle and f is measured from here 

476
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,930
outside to here outside. In other words, 
this 

477
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,730
is also the width of our 

478
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,950
rectangle. So we have 

479
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,450
created a rectangle that 

480
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,660
has the edge length E and F. 

481
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,200
The area of this rectangle 

482
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
is then equal to E times F, i.e. length 
times 

483
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
width. The only important thing here is 

484
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
that we have of course 

485
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,120

486
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,200
doubled the kite rectangle . Therefore, we 
now have to 

487
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,940

488
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,480
divide the formula by two again , because 
with the formula a 

489
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,560
equals e times f we calculate the 

490
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,020
area for two 

491
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,820
kite quadrilaterals. Therefore, the 

492
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,440
formula for one kite quadrilateral is a 

493
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,800
is equal to one and a half times e times 
f. 

494
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,260
And this allows us to 

495
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,480
calculate the area of the kite hexagon. 

496
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,240
This brings us to the rhombus. 

497
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,800
The rhombus is a special form of the 

498
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,120
kite hexagon and the rhombus has the 

499
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,640
property that all sides 

500
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,880
are the same length, similar to the 
square, 

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,780
except of course that there are no 

502
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,640
right angles. And because all 

503
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:37,080
sides are the same length 

504
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,900
, the rhombus can also be broken down 
differently. With 

505
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,480
the rhombus, the edge E is still 

506
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,640
a line of symmetry or the 

507
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,240
line of symmetry and we also have 

508
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,780
the option of 

509
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,680
specifying the two diagonals E and F with 
a rhombus . 

510
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,680
If the rhombus is specified by its 
edgelets 

511
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,540
A, then it is 

512
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,000
treated as a parallelogram, because the 

513
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,920
rhombus is actually just a 

514
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,300
parallelogram, because the edge is 

515
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,420
parallel to the edge and the side 

516
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,800
is parallel to the side and so 

517
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,060
we have 

518
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,700
fulfilled all the properties of a 
parallelogram. That is why 

519
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,360
it is also common to specify the 

520
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,980
base side and the height of a rhombus . 

521
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,460
And then, as already mentioned, it is a 

522
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,280
parallelogram, which 

523
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,460
has the property that all sides 

524
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,360
are the same length. But there is also 

525
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,920
the property or the possibility of 

526
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,580
specifying the diagonals E and F, as 

527
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,700
is known from the kite shape. 

528
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,380
Therefore, the rhombus is a special 

529
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,160
form of the kite quadrilateral and 

530
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,780
can therefore be 

531
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,100
calculated using the same formula. But 
let's take 

532
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,260
another look at how the rhombus 

533
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,820
can be broken down. So A is equal to 1.5 

534
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,680
E times F. E and F are again the 

535
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,600
two diagonals. And how can we 

536
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,240

537
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,680
turn this rhombus into a rectangle using a 
simple transformation? As 

538
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,040
just mentioned, E and F are 

539
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,280
the vertical and 

540
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,700
horizontal diagonals respectively. the 

541
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,580
vertical fd horizontal and we 

542
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,420
cut the kite square it 

543
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,720
swings we 

544
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,560
first cut the rhombus at its horizontal 

545
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,940
diagonal i.e. at f we get 

546
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:19,320
two triangles these 

547
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,620
have the property that 

548
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,520
they are equal because it is also a 

549
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,920
symmetry line therefore stone is there 

550
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,700
along f and next 

551
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,080
we divide the matched part again so 

552
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,720
that we contain two rectangles because 

553
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,960
this rectangle is the same as 

554
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,680
that or just that therefore we 

555
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,160
now put these rectangles here like this 

556
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,720
and make a 

557
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,820
rectangle out of the triangle yes so we 

558
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,060
now put the triangles differently 3 g, to 

559
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,560
create a rectangle . We can see that 

560
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,960
here. We now have a rectangle 

561
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,000
and what is very important is that 

562
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,880
, unlike with a 

563
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,760
kite quadrilateral , we have not 

564
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,820
duplicated our figure. So we haven 

565
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,080
't drawn it again next to it. 

566
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
We are still only looking at one 

567
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,560
figure. And we can now see that the 

568
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,420
resulting rectangle has a 

569
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:27,080
different width f and height. 1.5 E is the 

570
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,180
length of the rectangle, i.e. 

571
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,960
the height if you like, and F is the 
width. 

572
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,140
And because it is a rectangle 

573
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,300
, we can 

574
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,000
calculate the area by A times B, i.e. 
length 

575
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,980
times width. And so we arrive at 1.5 

576
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,360
times E times F for the area of 

577
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,060
a rhombus. 

578
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,920
And as just mentioned, the 

579
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,740
rhombus is also... a 

580
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,120
kite quadrilateral, a special 

581
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,960
kite quadrilateral, because 

582
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,160

583
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,520
not all sides of a kite quadrilateral are 
normally the same length. And 

584
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,100
that's why we can 

585
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,780
calculate it with the same formula. We 
could have 

586
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,660

587
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,140
dissected the rhombus in the same way as 
the kite quadrilateral. That 

588
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,560
would also have been possible, of course. 

589
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,260
Well, let's finish with 

590
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,240
a quick look at compound surfaces. 

591
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,020
We have a surface here, 

592
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,180
a small task and we are 

593
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,100
now supposed to calculate the area A. 

594
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,800

595
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,300
There are no pre-colored formulas for 
compound areas. 

596
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,220
Composite surfaces must 

597
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,060
be broken down into several surfaces in 
such a way 

598
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,260
that 

599
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,840
formulas are known for the individual 
surfaces that are created. 

600
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,800
In other words, we try to create a figure 
like this 

601
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,460
in the form of 

602
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,640
rectangles and triangles , if possible. 

603
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
That gets you quite far. 

604
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,500
Of course, you can also 

605
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,740
reshape something into a trapezoid or a 
frame 

606
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,760
or cut it out, divide it up. 

607
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,420
But you do it or try to do it as much as 

608
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,860
possible with rectangles and 

609
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,980
triangles. The important thing here is 
that E is 

610
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,740
the width from here to here, D is 

611
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,760
the length from here to here, F from 

612
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,460
here to here, A from here to here. 

613
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,000
C from here to here and B from here 

614
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,700
to here. We'll have to 

615
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,040
pay attention once we've broken it down. 

616
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,440
In fact, we're going to 

617
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,420
show you two possibilities . 

618
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,060
There are many more possibilities. 

619
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,860
This is the first one, which means 

620
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,320
we're going to form two large 

621
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,660
rectangles. We have a 

622
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,120
rectangle here and a rectangle here. 

623
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,600
Of course, it would have been just as good 
to 

624
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,420

625
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,680
make a very long rectangle here and a 

626
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,920
correspondingly smaller one here. That 
works 

627
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,960
too. 

628
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,180
But we decided to do it this way. In other 
words 

629
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,240
, as I just said, we have now 

630
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,880
created two rectangles. It is important to 
note 

631
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,900
that the rectangle that 

632
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,400
is vertical here has the edge lengths 

633
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,380
E and F. So F is from here to 

634
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,540
here and that is, if 

635
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,340
you like, the height of the rectangle and 
E 

636
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,700
is the width. The second rectangle 

637
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,120
down here , which is horizontal, has the 

638
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,260
edge length C, because C 

639
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
is measured from here to here, and the 
height B. 

640
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,160
As just mentioned, A 

641
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,880
is the edge length up to here. 

642
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,280
This means that A is not the 

643
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,780
edge length of the new rectangle, that 

644
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,260
is C, because our rectangle 

645
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,960
ends here. That is very important. 

646
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,500
That's why you have to be 

647
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,900
careful about... be careful. If you 

648
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,000
enter the wrong value here and 

649
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,940
of course 

650
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,440
calculate the area , you have 
unfortunately 

651
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
made a small mistake. The second 

652
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,420
option is to 

653
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,480

654
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,940
divide the two or the figure here along 
the corners. This means 

655
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,260
that two trapezoids are created. The 
trapezoids, i.e. the 

656
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,820
base side of one trapezoid is 

657
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,140
A and the upper side parallel to it 

658
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,300
is C. Here it would be F and D. You can 

659
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,720
also divide it in this way and then 

660
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,100
you have to 

661
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,100
use the formula for two trapezoids . You 
can choose 

662
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,140
which variant you want to use. As 

663
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,680
I said, you usually try to 

664
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,560
divide it into rectangles. The advantage 

665
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,860
of rectangles is that 

666
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,100
you can 

667
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
memorize the formula for a rectangle very 
well, and of 

668
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,360
course you can memorize the formula for 
the trapezoid too, but the 

669
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
calculation effort for the rectangle is 

670
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,040
usually a little less. that's why 

671
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,440
it's usually the faster way 

672
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,980
to divide it into two rectangles 

673
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,120
, or in this case it would 

674
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
have been faster if a 

675
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,180
figure stopped at one end 

676
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:46,060
, i.e. if it tapered like this, then 

677
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,520
of course it's an advantage 

678
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,200
to form a trapezoid from it right away , 
which brings us to 

679
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
the end of the webinar. 

680
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,940
thank you for your attention.
