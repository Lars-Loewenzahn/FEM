Hello, Dr. Smith. Hello, Josie. How 

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,400
can I help you? I feel 

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,920
sick. Okay, let's see. Are you in 

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,320
pain? Yes, my comfort is 

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,400
painful and I have a 

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,840
bad case. Do you have a 

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,000
pain? Yes, I have one. How long have 

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,520
you had all these symptoms? I 

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,900
think it's been two days. It sounds 

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,120
like you have the flu. All you need 

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,780
is to get plenty of rest. 

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,300
If you're still a few days old, 

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,540
you can call me. Thank you. 

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,140
Bye. Bye.
