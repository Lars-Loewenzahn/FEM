00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello and welcome to

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,400
a learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,580
Today's topic is Europe. Europe 

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,880
is called l'Europe in French. 

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,210
Let's take a look at some of the countries 
in 

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,050
Europe. We have quelques pays de 

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,990

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,310

or la Grande-Bretagne is the 

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,630

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,870
Britain, the adjective 

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,670
britannique. 

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,380
Then l'Angleterre is England, 

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,620
Anglais, Anglaise. L'Ecosse 

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,960

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,700
the accent changes here. Belgium, la

Netherlands, Niederlandes. 

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,760
You write the adjectives 

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,680
in lower case, of course, but if you're 
talking about the people 

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,640
who live in the country, 

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,120
it's capitalized. So here's an 

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,000
example, L'Énirlandais, it's 

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,560
capitalized. This applies to 

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
all adjectives. 

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,940
Now let's take a look at the seas in 

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,720
Europe. 

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,640
We call the Atlantic Ocean l'Atlantique. 
The North Sea, 

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,980
and the Mediterranean, la Méditerranée. 

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,660
Be careful here with double R and 

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,700
two E's at the end. 

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,940
In Europe, of course, we also have 

47
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,240
the European Union, which is called l 

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,560
'Union Européenne, or l'UE for short. 

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,340
The adjective is Européen, 

50
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,940
Europäenne. We have 28 members, 

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,080
28 Membre and 24 Lang-Officiel, 24 

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,920

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,490
Let us now turn to the political centers 
of 

54
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,210
the European Union. Brussels, 

55
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,870
Luxembourg 

56
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,850
and Strasbourg. 

57
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,750
In Strasbourg there is the European 

58
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,290
Parliament. In Brussels there is the 

59
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,510

60
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,070
European Commission. In Luxembourg there 

61
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,930
is the EU Court of Justice. 

62
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,930
These are the political centers of the 

63
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,010
European Union. In many 

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,050
EU countries, of course, we also have the 

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,450
euro, l'Euro, and the eurozone, la 

66
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,270
zone euro. 

67
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,510
La Banque Centrale Européenne 

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,330

70
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,700
So to summarize, today we have 

71
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,240

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,790
