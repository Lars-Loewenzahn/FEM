00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,060
Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,520
another learning video from 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,480
Schülerhilfe . Today I'd like to 

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,500

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,060

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,080
introduce you to different ways of 
translating the Latin passive voice , or 
rather 

7
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,920
the first possibility in this video. 

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,860
Let's take a look at the following 

9
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,020
example sentences that I' 

10
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,860
ve brought with me. 

11
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,460
We have the active sentence Piraten sink 

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,240
das Schiff. If we put this sentence in the 

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,800
passive voice, you get navis 

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,540
apiratis mergitur. 

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,040
Of course, you can also recognize the 

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,240
passive verb ending here with mergitur . 
The ship is 

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,700
sunk by pirates. 

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,460
So what happened when we 

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,120
changed the active sentence into the 
passive 

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,400
? You see, we turned the 

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,040
accusative object navem in the passive 
sentence 

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,320
into a subject, navis. 

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,640
So let's remember the following. An 

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,140
active sentence always requires an active 

25
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,640
subject. In a passive sentence, 

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,980
on the other hand, you always have a 
subject 

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,380
that is acted upon. Here, for example, 

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,080
the ship that 

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,740
is sunk by the pirates . 

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,100
Now let's take a look at 

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,280
the following example sentence. Titanic 
navis 

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,380
mersa est. The ship Titanic or 

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,580
the Titanic was sunk. Now 

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,380
you may ask yourself, 

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,080
didn't the ship. .. just sank when it 

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,920
hit an iceberg? Yes, 

37
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,900
that is indeed what happened. Because the 

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,780
passive translation would of course 

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,920
suggest that the Titanic 

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,140
was sunk by someone. 

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
By whom? Ice pirates 

42
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,420
or a wild horde? Pirate 

43
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,860
icebergs? We don't know. But in any case 

44
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,380
, we realize that the 

45
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,700
passive translation doesn't 

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,800
really make sense here. 

47
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,760
However, there are a total of four 

48
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,440
ways to 

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,480
translate a Latin passive, apart from a 

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,620
regular passive. 

51
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,890
Now I would like to look at the 

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,390
first option with you , the 

53
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,050
so-called medial-reflexive 

54
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,410
translation. To do this, we'll use 

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,050
an example sentence, post laborem 

56
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,750
labor, and this example sentence 

57
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,710
contains the verb lavare, to wash, 

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,410
which I' 

59
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,550
ve also written down for you. So the 
question is, how do 

60
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,870
we translate this sentence? Post 

61
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,590
laborem labor. 

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,880
If we translate it as passive, the 

63
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,480
result is, after work, 

64
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:01,020
post laborem labor, I am 

65
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,880
washed. 

66
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,740
And of course you might 

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,520
ask yourself , yes, by whom? By whom am I 

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,580
washed after work? 

69
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,620
By myself, of course. And 

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,020
that's why the better 

71
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,240
translation here is , after work 

72
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,000
I wash myself. 

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,820
Here is the 

74
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,760
translation we have just found: after 

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,460
work I wash myself. And here 

76
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,080
I pull out the verb, I 

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,480
wash myself. If we now 

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,180
look at this sentence, you can see that 
you 

79
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,900
once have I. So I myself am 

80
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,260
the subject, i.e. I am the 

81
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,240
washer, active. But at the same time, 

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,420
I am also the one being washed, 

83
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,800
passively . That is actually 

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,060
the special feature of this so-called 

85
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,540
reflexive translation: I wash 

86
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,860
myself. Reflexivity is therefore 

87
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,900
somewhere right in the middle between 

88
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,340
active and passive. And that explains 

89
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,200
the name 

90
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,580
mediator. The Latin word for 

91
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,580
middle is medium. I've written it 

92
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,080
down for you here, medium, and 

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,860
that means middle. And hence the 

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,480
name medialreflexive. 

95
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,100
Let's now 

96
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,440
 return to our Titanic  problem. We have 

97
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
established that the passive 

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,060
translation, the Titanic was 

99
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,820
sunk or the ship Titanic 

100
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,140
was sunk, makes little sense. 

101
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,840
Let's 

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,820
perhaps just try out our newly 

103
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,880
acquired media-reflexive 

104
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,300
translation. Then we would have the 

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,900
Titanic sank 

106
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,900
. 

107
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,790
Yes, and you've already noticed that the 

108
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,490
medial reflexive translation seems 

109
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,290
almost a little stranger here 

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,310
than the passive translation, because 

111
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,110
which ship sinks itself? 

112
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,090
So 

113
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,650
I'll explain how we translate this in the 
next video. 

114
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,350
I hope to see you again then. 

115
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:27,590
See you then!
