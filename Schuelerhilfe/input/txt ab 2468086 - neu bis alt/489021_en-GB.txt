00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,280
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,920
learning videos at Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,840
Today's topic is the 

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,680
dative object. Just like in German 

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,640
, we also ask about 

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,440
the dative object with whom in Latin. 

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,650
First of all, the dative object is used to 

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,130
complement transitive verbs 

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,850
that already have an accusative object 

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,650
. To repeat, transitive 

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,070
verbs always have an 

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,830
accusative object. And then they are used 

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,390
to describe the recipient of a 

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,730
thing or a message. 

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,960
Here is a 

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,160
first example to illustrate this . Librum 
amico dono. 

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,800
I give the book to my friend. We 

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,240
ask, who am I giving the book to? And 

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,100
our answer is, to my friend. 

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,980

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,680
In second place come the intransitive 
verbs, which 

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,300
are followed by a dative. They then denote 

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,720
either a benefit or a 

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,440
harm. 

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,680
Our example here would be Der Krieg 

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,300
schadete dem Staat. We ask 

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,300
again, who did the war harm? And 

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,520
our answer is the state. 

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,010
The third point 

30
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,150
to remember is the 

31
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,770
impersonal verbs with a 

32
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,810
dative object. Here, 

33
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,820
for example, we have mihi kontiget, the 
dative 

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,340
mihi, es gelingt mir. 

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,840
The dative object is in brackets here, 

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,260
as the expression 

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,820
can also stand for itself. This means that 
you could also 

38
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,940
simply say kontiget, es gelingt 

39
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,620
and, in combination with the 

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,300
dative object, mihi kontiget, es 

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,720
gelingt mir. Our second example 

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,380
would then be tibi akidit it happens to 

43
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,560
you. This is followed by nobis libet, 

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,040
we like it or we like it. 

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,320
That would be the second 

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,040
possible translation at this 

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,420
point . 

48
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
Here again is a small 

49
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,040
example sentence tibi plakit aves 

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,900
observare. Tibi would be our dative case 
here 

51
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,660
and in German we would have 

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,640
Es gefällt dir, die 

53
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,960
Vögel zu beobachten. 

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
Finally, here are the 

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
Latin verbs which, 

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,500
unlike German verbs, 

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,740
require a dative object. Our first example 
at 

58
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,220
this point would be Novice rebus 

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,880
studere, a coup or 

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,280
overthrow plan. And in Latin 

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,570
we have the dative case here, which we 

62
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,570
recognize by the ending "-is and "-bus. 

63
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,670
In German, however, we ask 

64
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,750
with whom or what a coup or 

65
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,830
overthrow and accordingly for 

66
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,410
an accusative object. 

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
Here is a 

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,580
second example to illustrate the whole 
thing 

69
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,520
even more clearly. 

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,340
We would have feminis pacere, die Frauen 

71
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,080
verschonen, the ending is, in 

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,200
Latin for the dative case 

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,580
, but in German we ask again 

74
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,500
with wen or was and accordingly 

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,580
for an accusative object. 

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,200
At this point, we have reached our 

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,140
summary. The 

78
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,520
dative object is asked for with whom and 

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,020
in German, instead of the 

80
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,500
dative object, the dative object can be 
asked for with whom. 

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,320
what in Latin also 

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,380
stands for another object. You 

83
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,560

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
learned about this in the last two 
examples. There we had 

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
the 

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,420
accusative object in German. Thank you for 

87
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,380
your attention and see you soon for 

88
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,760
a video from Schülerhilfe.
