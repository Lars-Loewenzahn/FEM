Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,060
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,380
This video is about the 

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,620
indentation method. This is particularly 

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,560

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,540
helpful when translating longer texts. 
With this method, 

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,860
you write main and subordinate clauses 

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,660
one below the other. This is useful if you 

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,380
have sentence periods that 

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,540

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,980
have several nested sub-sentences that are 
difficult 

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,840
to keep track of. 

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,440
The indentation method can then be used to 

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,320
graphically 

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
represent the sequence of these 
subordinate clauses . The 

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
subordinate clauses are indented according 
to their degree of 

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,280
dependency. A main clause can 

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,200
always stand alone, a 

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,880
subordinate clause always depends on a 

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,400
main clause. If we now 

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,260
have a main clause on which several 

22
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,920
subordinate clauses depend, then the 

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,360
first subordinate clause that 

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,800
depends on this main clause is a 

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,240
first-degree subordinate clause. If 

26
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,360
further 

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,780
subordinate clauses depend on this 
first-degree subordinate clause 

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,780
, then they are second-degree, 

29
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,160
third-degree and so on. 

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,360
Next, let's take a look at the indentation 
method 

31
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,660
using an example. Here we have 

32
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,020
an example from Caesar in De Bello 

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,420
Gallico. 

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,440
Ergerime confekerant, ut flumen 

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,160
transirent, caesarem uno die fecisse 

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,820
intelegrent, legatus ad eum mitunt. 

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,840
If we now 

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,300
want to translate this text , we can 
already see that there 

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,680
are several partial sentences 

40
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,020
that are nested within one another. 

41
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,640
The first task is to 

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
write the text one below the other. 

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,180
We follow the German 

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,040
comma system and assign 

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,640
a 

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,760
separate line to each sentence that comes 
before a comma . These different 

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,280
sections often begin with 

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,280
introductory words that 

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,400
indicate that a subordinate clause is to 
follow. 

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,000
Cum, quod, ut. In the next step 

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,140
, we move the first subordinate 

52
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,900
clause one to the right, as the main 
clause 

53
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,080
always remains on the far left. Here 

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,640
we now have the sentence that 

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,060
begins with Cum and move the 1 to the 
right 

56
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,280
. It is important 

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,620
to note that the subordinate clause is not 

58
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,600
complete here , because a 

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,920
predicate is missing. The next subordinate 
clause 

60
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,620
we have is the sentence that begins with 

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,280
the introduction Quod. 

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,820
There is a predicate at the end , so 

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,100
this subordinate clause is complete. Then 

64
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,320
a second one, let's indent the Ut 

65
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,280
 clause, which also has a 

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,620
predicate and is therefore complete. 

67
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,290
In the next section, we notice 

68
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,890
that there is a predicate at the end 

69
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,450
and here we know, aha, 

70
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,750
at the top of the cum, there was still a 

71
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,850
predicate missing. We have now found this 

72
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,890
here at Intelligerent. This 

73
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,010
means that we then 

74
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,150
move Kaisarim to the same level as Kum. 

75
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,370
Below the rest Legatus ad eum mitund, 

76
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,390
which is still part of the main clause and 

77
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,370
therefore remains 

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,480
on the far left. We can 

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,980
visualize the whole thing even better by 

80
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,420

81
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,340
drawing dashed lines through it. The 

82
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,060
main clause is on the far left, followed 
by the subordinate clause, which 

83
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,960
continues below. This is 

84
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,920
the subordinate clause of the first 
degree, then 

85
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,980
comes the quad clause, which is the 

86
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,340
subordinate clause of the second degree 
and then the subordinate 

87
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,520
clause of the third 

88
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,220
degree. The subordinate clause of the 
first degree 

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,620
now depends on the main clause, the 

90
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,680
second degree again on the first degree 

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,380
and the third on the second. This is 

92
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,220
helpful for the translation because 

93
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,920
we then start with 

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,540
the main clause. We 

95
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,220
then have the complete main clause here 

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,900
, which we can then translate. 

97
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,180
At the end, we have the predicate 

98
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,160
with and. It is always easiest 

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,040
to translate the predicates first. 

100
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,920
We also notice that we 

101
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,900
have a non-finite verb form here 

102
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,700
, komoti. This shows us that 

103
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,640

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,440
we have a conjunctive participle here and 
then we look for the 

105
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,740
related word. In this 

106
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,060
case, it is Helvetia. 

107
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,800
In this case, the patikipium conjunct 

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,300
is translated as an affix. The translation 

109
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
of the main clause then reads, the 

110
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,680
Helvetii were 

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,520
very moved by his sudden arrival and 

112
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,860
they therefore sent envoys 

113
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,100
to him. That it is 

114
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,080
translated as an apposition means another 

115
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,840
main clause that 

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,780
is followed by and therefore or and 
thereupon. 

117
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,640
Depending on which sense you 

118
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,280
want to give the translation. Therefore is 

119
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,620
a causal sense and thereupon 

120
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,860
is temporal. Next, let's look 

121
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,920
at the subordinate clause 

122
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,840
of the first degree and translate it. We 

123
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,740
start here because or as, 

124
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,120
again depending on the 

125
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,620
direction you want to take here. Because 

126
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,900
they realized that Caesar 

127
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,740
had done this in a single day. 

128
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,980
Again, it's important to 

129
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,180
translate the predicate first and then 

130
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,340
fill the rest of the sentence with 
meaning. Then 

131
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,620
we look at the subordinate clause of the 
second degree 

132
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,120
, which here begins with Quad, which 

133
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,930
they themselves 

134
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,990
had accomplished with extreme difficulty 
in 20 days. It is important to 

135
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,050
note here that the quad 

136
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,110
is not a factual quad, but 

137
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,730
has the function of a relative pronoun, 
which refers to 

138
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,270
the It above and therefore 

139
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,090
we translate the whole thing here as 

140
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,330
Bas. 

141
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
In the next step, we have 

142
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,580
the subordinate clause of the third 
degree, 

143
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,640
the ut flumentranslating. Then 

144
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,640
we translate this as namely crossing the 

145
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,780
river. Here, the Ut has been 

146
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,220

147
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,960
translated with nämlich and an infinitive 
. The whole thing can also be 

148
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,620
translated more literally, for example, 

149
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,560
that they crossed the river. To 

150
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,420

151
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,380
summarize the whole thing once again, we 
have 

152
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,720
looked at the indentation method here. 

153
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,600
The main clause is 

154
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,880
written on the far left and each 
subordinate clause is 

155
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,800

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,640
indented to the right depending on the 
degree of dependency . 

157
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,180
When translating , 

158
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,740
the introductory words of the 

159
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,640
subordinate clauses are particularly 
important. 

160
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,000
These should be 

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,880
translated first. If we then 

162
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,740

163
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,700
translate the individual sentences one 
after the other , starting with the 

164
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,780
main clause, then it is important that 

165
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,240
the predicates 

166
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,720
are translated first , that the 
sentence-value 

167
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,780
constructions are recognized, 

168
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,840
such as participle conjunctum 

169
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,320
or an ACI, and that these are then 

170
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,080
translated so that 

171
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,980
the meaning of the text can 

172
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,500
be found out afterwards . 

173
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,440
Thank you for your attention. Bye, 

174
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,500
see you next time.
