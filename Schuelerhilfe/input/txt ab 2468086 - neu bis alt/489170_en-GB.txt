00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,720
Hello, I'm delighted that you 

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,260
're back today. In this 

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,480
video, I would like to explain to you 

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,980
how to create the normal at a point on 

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,280
a function. In the 

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,740
previous video, I already explained how to 

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,200
create a tangent to a function 

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,100
and I'm going to 

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,860

10
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,280
refer back to the results of the previous 
video. This means that if 

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,720
you are going a bit too fast here, it may 

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,080
be helpful to watch the 

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,100
previous video . 

14
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,740
To explain everything a little better, I 
have already 

15
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,440
prepared my coordinate system. 

16
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,040
In this coordinate system, we have 

17
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,980
given the function fx. 

18
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,200
We have 

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,640
created the tangent t to this function in 
the previous video, at 

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,800
point p. And we 

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
now want to create the normal n on this 
tangent . The 

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
normal is exactly perpendicular to the 

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,580
tangent. What we 

24
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,200
take from the last video... take. 

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,440
Our function was called x to the power of 
3 minus 

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,520
3x squared plus x minus 2 and the 

27
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,120
point at which we 

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,980
created the tangent was called p1 and 
minus 3. 

29
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,080
The result in the last video was the 

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,120
tangent minus 2x minus 1. This 

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,820
means that the slope of the tangent 

32
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,780
was mt is equal to minus 2. This 

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,240
intermediate result is 

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,820
very important for creating the normal. 

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,240
Let's start by creating the 

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,100
normal equation. Just like the 

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,620
tangent, the normal is a linear 

38
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,680
function and has the general 

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,140
form y is equal to m times x plus n. To 

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,880
determine the m of the normal, 

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,580
we can use this formula. m 

42
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,900
normal is equal to the negative 

43
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,580
reciprocal of the slope of the tangent. 

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,480
We therefore use the result of 

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,760
our last calculation for mt , i.e. mt 

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,340
is equal to minus 2. The result is 

47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,620
the slope of our normal. The 

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,200
calculation is therefore mn is equal to 

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,180
minus 1 divided by minus 2 and this 

50
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,820
means that mn is equal to 1.5 or 

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,060
0.5. What we are still 

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,420
missing for our complete equation is the 
n. 

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,600
I have 

54
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,180
written down all the important clues 
again. 

55
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,500
On the one hand, this is the point 

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,740
at which our normal lies, the slope 

57
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,920
of our normal and the general 

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,440
functional equation of a linear 

59
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,260
function. I insert the 

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,760
result for the m , the 

61
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,140

62
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,440
values of my point for the slope of the 
normal and for x and y. The 

63
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,600
equation is then minus 3 

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,960
equals 0.5 5 times 1 plus n. Now 

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,060
I solve the equation for n. I 

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,920
calculate minus 0.5 on both sides 

67
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,300
and get minus 3.5 equals 

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,680
n. Now I can 

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,020
set up a complete functional equation that 

70
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,660
corresponds to the equation of my tangents 

71
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,860
. Namely, n for tangent 

72
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,980
as a function of x is equal to 0.5. 5x 

73
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,140
minus 3.5. So let's 

74
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,420
summarize again. If you want to 

75
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,740
create the normal at a point, you must 

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,320
first 

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,180
determine the slope of the normal. The 
slope is the 

78
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,660
negative reciprocal of the slope of the 

79
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,020
function. You can then insert the point 

80
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,700
and the slope into the general 

81
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,280
functional equation of a linear 

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,480
function and 

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,660
solve for n. If you then insert both 

84
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,320
results into this pattern, you will 

85
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,100
get the equation of your 

86
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,560
normal function. Good luck and see you 

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,100
next time.
