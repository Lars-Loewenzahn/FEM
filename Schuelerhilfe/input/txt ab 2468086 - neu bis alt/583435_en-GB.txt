00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,820
Hello and welcome to the 

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,720
Schülerhilfe learning videos. 

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,020
In this video, you will learn the 

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,300
technical and content-related 

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,080
basics of a presentation. 

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,180
You will get an introduction to the 

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,520
basic functions of the 

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,700
Impress program. After that, you should be 

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,240
able to create your own 

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,940
presentations. 

11
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,240
These basic functions 

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,480
include selecting a layout, 

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,720
adding text , adding pages and 

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,180
inserting page numbers. You will 

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,140
also learn about the basic 

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,600
content structure of a 

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,340
presentation. This includes the 

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,800
start slide, which is something like the 

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,380
title page of your presentation, the 

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,720
table of contents, the 

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,860
references and the 

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,780
conclusion slide. So let's get started. 

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,560
First of all, we open the 

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,320
Emprez program. Once the program 

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,260
has started, a blank 

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,420
slide appears and we can 

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,840
start creating the presentation straight 
away. 

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,890
On the left-hand side of the screen you 
will see 

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,590
a column with an overview of 

30
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,090
all the slides. At the moment you 

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,890
only see one blank slide here , but soon 

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,710
we will add more slides. 

33
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,770
In the middle, you will always see the 

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,710
slide that you are currently editing. 

35
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,350
And at the top you can see the 

36
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,190
ribbon. This is where you will find all 
the important 

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,870
functions of Impress. 

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,790
To insert a text, we look for 

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,510
the sub-item Insert in the ribbon. 

40
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,520
In the ribbon that appears below this, 

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,720
click on Text field. You 

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,940
can now 

43
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
click on a position on the slide where you 

44
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,930
want to insert a new text field. The new 

45
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,610
text field will then be 

46
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,910
created exactly at this point . If you 

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,250

48
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,910
want to delete the text field later , 
simply click on the 

49
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,190
rest. edge of the text field to 

50
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,730
select it. Now you can delete it by 

51
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,670
pressing the Backspace or Delete 

52
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,350
 key. 

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,450
If you 

54
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,650
want to change the font size or font, 

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,090
click on 

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,250
Format in the ribbon and select the 
sub-item 

57
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,970
Characters. A 

58
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,090
pop-up window will then open in which you 

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,250
can format the font. You can move the 

60
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,970
text field by 

61
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,550

62
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,490
holding down the edge of the text box with 
the mouse and moving it. When the 

63
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,130
text is in the correct position, 

64
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,530
release the mouse. 

65
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,610
As a presentation consists of several 

66
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,810
slides, go to the menu ribbon 

67
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,970
and click on the menu item Slide. 

68
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,650
A ribbon will open . Click on 

69
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,630
New slide at the top . If you 

70
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,390
want to delete a page later, 

71
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,330
select the slide in the overview on the 

72
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,330
left-hand side of the screen and delete 

73
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,090
it with the Backspace or Delete 

74
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,450
 key. 

75
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,170
Let's now turn our attention to the 

76
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,570
basics of content. The structure of a 

77
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,330
presentation. 

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,160
Of course, the Impress 

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,940
presentation should present the technical 
content 

80
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,700
. 

81
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,580
However, the following additional slides 
should always be included. 

82
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,500
The opening slide with the topic of the 

83
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,300
presentation, a table of contents, the 

84
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,600
references and a 

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,440
concluding slide. The 

86
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
first slide of your presentation is 

87
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,380
something like the title page. The 
following 

88
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,360
information should be included on the 
start slide 

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,740
. The topic of the 

90
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,840
presentation, if it makes sense, 

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
a subtitle, in which course or 

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,300
subject the presentation takes place, 

93
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,640
for example in the 

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
math course, in Spanish or 

95
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,380
in the basic German course. 

96
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,500
The name of the presenter and 

97
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,840
the date on which the 

98
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,880
presentation will be given should also be 
mentioned . 

99
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,910
To make the start slide a little more 
appealing 

100
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,970
, it makes sense to 

101
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,770

102
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,270
use a suitable picture or something 
similar. 

103
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,850
Here you can see an example of a 

104
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,090
successful start slide. The title and 

105
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,350
subtitle are easy to read and 

106
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,150
placed in the middle. The other details 
such as 

107
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,190
course, date and the name of the 

108
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,070
lecturer are complete. 

109
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,350
In addition, the start slide is 

110
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,590

111
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,930
livened up by a funny but appropriate 
cover picture. 

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,460
After the start slide, we insert a 

113
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,300
table of contents. This should 

114
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,080
contain all the topics. 

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160

116
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,660

117
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,740
However, the start slide, the table of 
contents itself and the conclusion slide 
are not listed here. 

118
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,340
The table of contents 

119
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,380
is followed by the technical part of the 

120
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,040
presentation. 

121
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,910
After the technical part has been 
completed 

122
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,990
, the presentation still needs 

123
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,390
a bibliography. 

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,120

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,040
You have already learned how to correctly 
format references in 

126
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Module 1. 

127
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,860
The bibliography, which you 

128
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,140

129
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,260
insert at the end of the presentation , 
should 

130
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,500
contain all the sources that were used. 

131
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200

132
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,520
Don't forget the references for the images 
you 

133
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,480
have used. Sort the sources 

134
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
alphabetically. 

135
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,180
Now we are almost done. Only 

136
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,360
one slide is still missing. 

137
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,660
The last slide of our presentation 

138
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,740
is the final slide. 

139
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,920
The design of this depends on 

140
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
the situation and the taste of the 

141
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,480
presenter. The last slide can, 

142
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,560
but does not have to, contain the 
following. 

143
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,180
A thank you note for your 

144
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,920
attention, for example 

145
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Thank you for your attention. A 

146
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,760
note asking if there are any questions or 

147
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,740
need for discussion about the 
presentation. 

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,820
A summarizing statement or 

149
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,520
a concise picture or diagram 

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,460
from the presentation. 

151
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,010

152
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,390
You can see a good example of a concluding 
slide here. The 

153
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,810
picture of course relates to the 

154
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,670
topic of honey, which we have already 

155
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,950
used as an example in the start slide 

156
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,190
. 

157
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,420
To 

158
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,620
make the presentation perfect , the page 
numbers are still missing. 

159
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,080
We insert these by 

160
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,100

161
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,360
clicking on the Insert menu item in the 
ribbon and selecting the 

162
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,160
Slide numbers sub-item . 

163
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,820
A pop-up window opens. 

164
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,020
Check the boxes for Slide number and 

165
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,780
Do not show on first slide. 

166
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,520
This will 

167
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,470
hide the page number on the start slide. 
Finally, 

168
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,710
click on Apply to all. 

169
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,970
You have now 

170
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,830
become familiar with the main functions of 
Impress. 

171
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,050
In the next module, you will 

172
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,830
learn about other Impress functions. 

173
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,450
These include changing the font, 

174
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,390
inserting and placing 

175
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,290
images, inserting 

176
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,670
animations, the color design of 

177
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,870
slides and other functions. 

178
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,110
Thank you for your attention 

179
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,570
and I wish you every success in 

180
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,030
creating your presentation.
