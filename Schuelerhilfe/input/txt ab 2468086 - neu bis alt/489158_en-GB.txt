00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello and welcome to the learning video 

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,740
from Schülerhilfe. This video is 

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,960
about the so-called 

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,660
combinatorial counting methods, 

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,700
and in particular about 

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,540
ordered random sampling. There is also 

7
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,960
a video on unordered 

8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,960
random sampling. But what does ordered 
sampling mean 

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,780
? 

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,060
Ordered means that the order 

11
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,060
is important. In other words, ordered 

12
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,820
sampling can be equated 

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,600
with observing the order. But 

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,220
there are also two 

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,900
differences. One is 

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,000
drawing with putting back and the other is 

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,280
drawing without putting back. You 

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,180
always imagine an out-of-order model. 

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,160
Drawing with putting back means 

20
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,900
that we 

21
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,700
put the balls back after drawing. This 
means that the 

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,220
number of choices 

23
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,600
remains the same and so do the 

24
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,440
probabilities. 

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,380

26
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,040
However, when drawing without putting the 
ball back, the ball remains outside after 
the draw and 

27
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,660
this always changes 

28
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,420
the number of choices 

29
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,060
and therefore the 

30
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,480
probabilities. But 

31
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,600
let's take a look at this 

32
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,360
using an example. 

33
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,780
For example, if we have the question of 
how 

34
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,500
many possibilities there are for a 

35
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,260
four-digit PIN code, for example 

36
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,240
in a cell phone. If we now 

37
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,760
look at these two possibilities, 

38
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,700
for example 1, 2, 3, 

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,860
4 and 4, 3, 2, 1, these are actually 

40
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,220
the same numbers, but we know 

41
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,060
that they are not the same code. 

42
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,180
So the order is 

43
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,160
important in this task, which is why it is 
an 

44
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,740
ordered random sample, 

45
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,700
taking the order into account. 

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,460
Now let's 

47
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,720
solve this task. Let's think 

48
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,580
about how many ways there are to 

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,060
select a digit. 

50
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,980
We have the digits 0 to 9, and 

51
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,060
that for each field. That's 

52
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,300
a total of 10 possibilities. 

53
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,660
This means that I have 

54
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,440
10 possibilities for my first digit, 

55
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,740
10 possibilities for my second digit and 

56
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,080
also for the third and fourth. What 

57
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,980
we do, and in 

58
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,240
probability we usually 

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,340
multiply, we multiply 

60
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,480
these four possibilities together 

61
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,140
and the result is 10. 1000. 

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,260
10,000 possibilities. You can 

63
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,740
also use a formula, 

64
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,900
namely n to the power of k. 

65
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,180
But what does n mean and what does k mean? 
n is the 

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,020
number of choices. 

67
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,160
We have already clarified this. That 

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,740
's 10 possibilities, as we 

69
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,060
have the numbers 0 to 9. k is the 

70
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,280
number of draws, if we 

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,700
imagine our Ohn model again. 

72
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,320
And we draw 4 numbers from it. So 

73
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,500
k equals 4. If we 

74
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,160
use that, we get 10 to the power of 

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,450
4 and that is of course just the 10 

76
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,730
,000 that we just got out 

77
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:06,970
. 

78
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,580
Now we want to change the tasks... 

79
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,600
position a little. 

80
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,180
We now say that each digit 

81
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,400
can only occur once. 

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,460
So that's not drawing with 

83
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,380
putting back, because once a digit 

84
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,900
has been drawn, it doesn't come 

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,360
back. Therefore, we draw without 

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,620
putting it back. This means that if we 
start with 

87
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,220
our first digit, we still have 

88
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,460
10 possibilities, the 

89
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,500
digits 0 to 9. But if a 

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,920
digit is drawn, we only have 

91
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,740
9 more digits to choose from. 

92
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,900
So at the second digit there 

93
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,740
are only nine possibilities. For the 

94
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,100
third digit, since two 

95
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,060
digits have already been drawn, there are 
only 

96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,840
eight possibilities and therefore 

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,420
seven for the fourth. 

98
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,580
Again, we multiply these 

99
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,380
possibilities and get 

100
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,380
5040 possibilities as a result. In other 
words, 

101
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,460
just under half of the 

102
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,180
possibilities from before. The whole thing 

103
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,920
can also be broken with a 

104
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,180
coefficient 

105
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,310
, namely n factorial divided by n minus 

106
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,350
k factorial . 

107
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,970
Again , we have to think about what n is 
and what 

108
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,410
k is. n was the number of 

109
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,070
choices, just like 

110
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,510
10 before , because there 

111
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,330
are 10 digits , and k was the number of 

112
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,170
draws. We have four digits 

113
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,590
, so four draws. If we use this 

114
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,570
, we get the following 

115
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,310
term. Here it is again, 

116
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,990
with the 10 at the top. 10 factorial 

117
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,330
divided by 10 minus 4 factorial. 

118
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,230
That would be 10 factorial 

119
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,790
divided by 6 factorial. If we 

120
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,610
write this down, we can 

121
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,490
immediately see that we 

122
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,470
can shorten a lot of digits at the top and 
bottom. And 

123
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,070
what remains is our 10 times 9 times 8 
times 

124
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,450
7, which we already had above. 

125
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,090
Let's 

126
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,090
briefly summarize the whole thing again. 
This video was 

127
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,910
about the ordered sample. 

128
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,130
Ordered random sampling means that 

129
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,640
the order is taken into account. Here, 

130
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,340
however, we can also 

131
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,840
differentiate again 

132
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,760
between drawing with a reserve and drawing 
without 

133
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,260
a reserve, if we 

134
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,100
think of our without model. When drawing 
with 

135
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,780
putting back, the number of 

136
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,520
possibilities remains the same and so do 

137
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,440
the probabilities. When drawing 

138
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,080
without putting back, the number of 

139
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,540
possibilities does not remain the same and 

140
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,740
the probabilities also change 

141
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,820
. When drawing with putting back 

142
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,080
, we can remember the term n to the power 
of k 

143
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,920
, where n is the number of 

144
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,800
choices and k is the 

145
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,820
number of moves, i.e. the number of draws. 

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,340
And when drawing without putting back, 

147
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,100
we use this term and n and k 

148
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,180
are the same there. Thank you for 

149
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,660
your attention and I look forward 

150
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,160
to the next time.
