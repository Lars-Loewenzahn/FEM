Hello and welcome to 

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,180
a learning video from Schülerhilfe. 

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,000
Today's educational video is about the 

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,460
computer. In 

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,620
French , the computer is called 
L'ordinateur and is 

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,360
male. The abbreviation is 

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,400
i.e. the portable computer. 

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,540
The tablet is called la tablette. 

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,980
The keyboard, le clavier. The mouse, la 

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,760

feminine . And the scanner, le scanner 

17
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,830
or le scanneur. You can decide 

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,950
for yourself whether to put the U 

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,370
between the E and the R. 

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,430
Now we come to the inner 

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,730
components of the computer. 

22
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,730
Firstly, the software, le logiciel, the 

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,690
program, le programme, the hardware, 

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,370
le hardware. Again, it's important that 
you 

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,730
don't say the H. And the 

26
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,130

need, 

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,240
la corbeille. 

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,240
Now we come to the various 

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,100
actions we 

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,320

we come to other 

51
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,650
actions that you 

52
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,130

just clicking, klické sur quelque 

54
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,710
chose, again paying attention to the sur 

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,610

56
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,550
