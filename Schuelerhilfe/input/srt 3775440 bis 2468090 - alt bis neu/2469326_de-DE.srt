1
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,310
So, hello and welcome to the webinar 

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,770
today in English language variants, 

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,830
rhetorical devices. My name is 

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,090
Sarah Fischer, I'm glad 

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,670
you're here and 

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,210
first of all I would ask you to 

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,810
write in the chat if you 

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,430
can see the presentation. 

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,690
Okay, very good. 

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,690
Good, okay. Right, I've had 

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,150
a few messages privately now, 

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,330
but it's fine if you 

13
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,010
can see it. Right, I don't know if you' 

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,210
ve ever been to one of my webinars 

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,390
. Basically 

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,330
, I give the presentation and 

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,190
at the end you still have time for 

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,710
questions if you want me to explain 
something again 

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,310
, if something has remained unclear. 

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,610
Right, then we'll start. That's 

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,840
it . Stylistic devices means 

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,820
creative devices. Exactly, and the 

23
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,500
primary webinar will now be in 

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,920
English. So, stylistic 

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,880
devices. Literature and words are 

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,960
used to 

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,340
give an excellent sense, idea or feeling. 

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Figurative language is important to 

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,820

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,420
make words unique and interesting. That 
makes sense, right? And 

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,780
knowledge of stylistic devices is 

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,700
important to 

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,100

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,640
identify their meaning and effect on the 
text . Often stylistic devices give 

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,920
recommendations, clarity or 

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,980
freshness of expression. The author 

37
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,860
of the text mainly uses stylistic 

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,160
devices to create a certain effect or 

39
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,980
to focus the reader's attention on a 

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,680
desired issue. 

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,920
We start with the Anaphora of Deutsch 

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,400
die Anaphora. Anaphora describes 

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,320
overt repetition at the beginning of 

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,060
a sentence in order to give emphasis 

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,140
to them. For example, In every cry of 

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,580
every man, in every infant's cry of 

47
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,740
fear, in every voice, in every bed. 

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,600
Quite clear, like every start is 

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,160
same, so there is a repetition at the 

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,600
beginning of sentences, and it 

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,420
emphasizes them. Emphasizes, I'm 

52
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,000
sorry. That is an F-O-R-A, you 

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,400
probably know that from German as 

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,320
well. The obliteration describes the 

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,680
repeated sound of the first consonant 

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,380
in a series of words. Therefore the 

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,460
sentence is rhythmized and 

58
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,780
emphasized. For example, a lazy lying 

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:06,020
lion. Then there is allusion. That is 

60
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,020
a reference to a character, a myth, 

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,720
an event, literary work or work of 

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,160
art. And often it's used to explain a 

63
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,000
situation with a well-known 

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,480
situation. Like an example. I feel 

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,880
like I'm going down. down the rabbit 

66
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,640
hole. It does refer to Alice and One 

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Chain Wonderland. So it explains the 

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,700
situation where the lyrical eye, for 

69
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,000
example, is in. And everybody knows, 

70
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,540
okay, like down the rabbit hole, it 

71
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,400
feels like excited or stuff. Yeah, 

72
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,300
that is allusion. 

73
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,120
Ambiguity, so mehrdeutschkeit, 

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,800
describes a word, a symbol or a 

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,580
circumstance that has plural meaning. 

76
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,120
and it's often used to humorize the 

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,160
situation. For example, the sauce is 

78
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,540
too hot. It got different meanings. 

79
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,640
For example, it can be too strongly 

80
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,320
heated or it's very spicy. So you 

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,260
don't know what exactly is meant. 

82
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,660
Maybe kind of self-explanatory, 

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,720
right? So antithesis or contrast, 

84
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,360
also antithesis, emphasizes the 

85
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,740
contrast between two things. Things 

86
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,180
or characters, for example, love 

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,180
is an ideal thing, relationship is 

88
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,060
a real thing. A confusion of the 

89
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,700
real with the ideal is never 

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,980
indispensable. You can see here 

91
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,200
quite obviously that 

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,620
the first lot is ideal and then 

93
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,960
on the other hand as a contrast 

94
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,100
or as an entity the relationship is 

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,160
a real thing. So it separates 

96
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,900
love and relationship. Yes, so the 

97
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,380
climax, you probably know that 

98
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,140
from German or from Latin. 

99
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,580
The climax describes the change 

100
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,820
in a text where the tension or the 

101
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,980
value level is slowly increased. For 

102
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,360
example, as you 

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,660
can see here in the formation, there is a 
rising 

104
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,720
tension, then there is the climax, 

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,460
the highest point, and then there 

106
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,500
is the tension. For example, he 

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,240
heard a noise. He got out of 

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,020
bed and walked into the room. When he 

109
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,840
walked down the stairs, he saw a 

110
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,540
shadow. Suddenly, like there is 

111
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,500
rising tension, right? Yeah, that is 

112
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,960
climax. For example, yeah, in general 

113
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,040
it could also like be, like with 

114
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,980
adjective, for example, good, well, 

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,840
best. Yeah, that would also be a 

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,220
climax. Anticlimax is the opposite of 

117
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,140
a climax. and describes the transition 

118
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,140
from an important problem to a 

119
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,320
less important problem. 

120
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,080
So it can also refer to the tension that 
is 

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,960
discovered. So not an 

122
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,300
ascendancy, as it is for Karmix 

123
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,820
, but a discovery. For 

124
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,060
example, when a plot 

125
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,460
becomes very interesting and then 
something 

126
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,660
crazy or bad happens. So 

127
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,920
there is a rising tension, then 

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,320
comes Karmix and then there is 

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,300
anti-climax. So the lowest point. 

130
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,560
He has seen the ravages of war. He 

131
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,840
has known natural catastrophes. He 

132
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,860
has been to single bars. Right? It's 

133
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,940
quite boring. Who cares, right? So 

134
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,620
there's anticlimax. The ellipsis. So 

135
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,400
ellipse describes the omission of a 

136
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,360
word or phrase without a change in 

137
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,980
the meaning. So this can lead to a 

138
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,480
more causal or colloquial tone. This 

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,540
is always used in speech, 

140
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,180
but 

141
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
not so often in written language . He 

142
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
ordered two drinks and his friend 

143
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,100
won. You would say that, but 

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,600
you can say that something 

145
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,300
is missed if you want. The anumeration, 

146
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,300
Auszählung, in German it can also 

147
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,420
be inumeration. and that is used 

148
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,320
for listing details or to mention 

149
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,600
words and phrases step by step. They 

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,720
can clarify a topic and make it 

151
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,040
understandable for the reader and it 

152
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,480
also helps to avoid ambiguity. So you 

153
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,500
remember ambiguity. For example, 

154
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,320
I remember the neck curls, limp and 

155
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,020
damp as tendrils, and her quick look, 

156
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,240
a sightlong picarous smile, and how, 

157
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,460
once startled into talk, The light 

158
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,680
syllables leaped for her, and she 

159
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,300
balanced in the delight of her 

160
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,100
thoughts. Here. There were quite a 

161
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,960
lot of enumeration. Here, for listing 

162
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,980
details, it clarifies the talking. 

163
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,900
The euphemism, so euphemismus in 

164
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,440
German, replaces words and phrases 

165
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,900
which are impolite or harsh with 

166
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,400
polite, indirect expressions. For 

167
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,020
example, he's a special child. 

168
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,040
instead of he's disabled or learning 

169
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,880
challenged or he's got a lot of 

170
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,320
temperature, for example. Maybe you 

171
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,480
know it in German. It's the typical 

172
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,560
example of saying entschlafen instead 

173
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,000
of sterben. So, yeah, it's an 

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,760
embellishment. Or a 

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,220
positive paraphrase, I say, 

176
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,050
of a possible negative. So, 

177
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,890
the exclamation or interjections. 

178
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,350
Also exclamation. These are short 

179
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,450
expressions to show feelings of 

180
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,670
surprise or joy or something. For 

181
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,770
example, oops or cool or wow. 

182
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,370
Whatever. The hyperbole, so hyperbole 

183
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,130
in German, is an obvious and often 

184
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,250
unreal exaggeration of a statement to 

185
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,470
emphasize a point of view. Like you 

186
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,090
always use it in your own colloquial 

187
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,130
speech, so that is quite often. often 

188
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,910
used stylistic device. For example, I 

189
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,610
had to wait in the station for 10 

190
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,650
days in eternity. 

191
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,500
So, inversion describes a literary 

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,260
technique in which the normal order 

193
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,880
of words is reversed. So, often 

194
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,600
inversions are used to achieve an 

195
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,280
effect of an emphasis. For example, 

196
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,840
here by the rose tree They planted 

197
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,820
wands of lavender party in Italian 

198
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,780
bronze. So, you see, it's not the 

199
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,860
normal order of words. It's often 

200
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,560
used in poems and then you can 

201
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,720
like... Normally, a special word is 

202
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
emphasized and then you can analyze 

203
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,940
that one. 

204
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,880
Irony, these are when words are used 

205
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,080
in a way that their intended meaning 

206
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,980
differs from the actual meaning. This 

207
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,480
figure of speech illustrates the 

208
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,780
difference between appearance and 

209
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,940
reality. We can differentiate between 

210
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,780
verbal and situational irony. Verbal 

211
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,920
irony is using words to express 

212
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
something different from the literal 

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,760
meaning. For example, my teacher is 

214
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,760
as kind-hearted as a wolf. You say 

215
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,900
it's ironic. And the situational 

216
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,080
irony, the result is different from 

217
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,620
the expectation. So, the reader 

218
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,420
expects something to happen, 

219
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,600
but then something that 

220
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,220

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,480
means the whole story. For example, in The 
Wizard of 

222
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,700
Oz. The main character is looking for the 

223
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,300
Wizard to come back. But 

224
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,320
ironically, she can get herself 

225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,520
back without knowing it. That 

226
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,080
's irony too. Probably how 

227
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,840
we usually 

228
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,280
say it in Germany. We will probably talk 
about 

229
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,380
the verbal ironies. A 

230
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,160
metaphor is a stylistic device that 

231
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,880
expresses an implicit, hidden or 

232
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
implied comparison between two 

233
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,040
things. And these things are usually 

234
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,780
unrelated, but have some 

235
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,260
characteristics in common. For 

236
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,600
example, all the worlds are staged 

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,520
and all the men and women merely 

238
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,060
players. Yeah, so you see the two, 

239
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,700
like, worlds are staged and men and 

240
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,140
women merely players. That is a 

241
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,040
metaphor, so, yeah, it's staged. It 

242
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,620
starts with the world, so the 

243
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,300
world is a stage. And then we're 

244
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,160
all players in it. But it's like this... 

245
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,840
It's like that in the comparison, 

246
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,060
because the world is not the stage. 

247
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,320
But it's different from the 

248
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,940
comparison. We'll talk about that 

249
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,120
later too. An oxymoron 

250
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,760
is used to create an effect 

251
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,480
that 

252
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,740
thinks of the opposite. Often, an 

253
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,060
exymoron is 

254
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,320
constructed by combining an adjective with 
a noun. 

255
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,060
For example, life and death. But 

256
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,380
sometimes the contrasted 

257
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,540
ideas are split out in the sentence. 

258
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,760
So, to lead, you have to 

259
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,100
go after. For example, I 

260
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,640
find no peace and all my 

261
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,140
war is finished. You say peace 

262
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,600
and war, these are two mutual 

263
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,460
ideas. I have fear and hope, 

264
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,400
I burn and sound like ice. I flee 

265
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,980
above the wind, yet I can not arise. 

266
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,540
It's full of oxymorons. It's always 

267
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,420
like fear and hope at the same time. 

268
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,280
So in German. I worry and I 

269
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,820
rejoice, for example. You can say that 

270
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,060
in one sentence. That's 

271
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
also an oxymoron. 

272
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,020
Parallelism, Parallelismus, describes 

273
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,940
use of components in a sentence that 

274
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,580
are grim. Grammatically similar or 

275
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,860
same in construction, sound and or 

276
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,860
meaning. This leads to an impression 

277
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,020
of balance and rhythm and the 

278
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,960
repetition also conveys persu... 

279
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,840
Sorry. Persu...ness. Also 

280
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,120
conviction. I love thee freely as 

281
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,560
men strive for right. I love thee 

282
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,520
purely as they turn from praise. One 

283
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,780
can see here as it is also... So 

284
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,480
written directly after the motto. 

285
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,760
This is the same structure. I love 

286
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,920
thee. as So it is parallelism. 

287
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,330
The opposite of parallelism 

288
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,810
is chiasmus. So it's an inverted 

289
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,390
parallelism. The type of words in 

290
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,410
two other parallelisms is 

291
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,770
inverted. Fair is foul. Foul is 

292
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,290
fair. If you 

293
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,730
write these two scenes , among the others, 
you can 

294
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,710
make a couple of crores. So 

295
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,490
lazy is right and left and fair 

296
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,250
is left and right. So you have 

297
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,410
a crosse when you write it at the top 

298
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,390
. 

299
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,220
Yes, personality, you 

300
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,920
probably know , is used to 

301
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,820

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,360

303
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,040
connect human attributes to a thing, idea 
or animal. And they imply that 

304
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,800
non-human objects 

305
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,020
feel or behave like human beings. For 

306
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,260
example, the stars dance merrily in the 

307
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,180
moonward quay. So, of course, stars 

308
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,960
can't dance. But they are 

309
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,080
personified, so now they can 

310
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,940
dance. And that's also a 

311
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,820
stylistic device. And that's 

312
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,920
pretty easy to find, right? 

313
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,200
So, if you have an analysis and 

314
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,280
sometimes a poem is completely 

315
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,500
personified, you can 

316
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,060
write a lot about it. So, repetition, 

317
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,080
that's again... Holung is when the 

318
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,760
same words or phrases are repeated 

319
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,260
more than once. It is often used to 

320
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,940
make an idea clearer and more 

321
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,960
memorable. So it makes sense. The 

322
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,660
more often you hear something, the 

323
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,180
better you can recognize it. Remember 

324
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,140
it, sorry. For example. And that 

325
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,820
government of the people, by the 

326
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,700
people, for the people, shall not 

327
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,920
perish from earth. So it is from 

328
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,460
Abraham Lincoln, which was a 

329
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,780
former... President of the United 

330
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,060
States. So he puts emphasis on the 

331
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,240
people. So government is all about 

332
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,800
the people. 

333
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
The rhetorical question, that means 

334
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,200
that when a rhetorical question is 

335
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,100
asked, there is no real answer. So it 

336
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,480
is not expected to answer to the 

337
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,200
question. It is solely asked for 

338
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,040
effect or to emphasize a statement. 

339
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,380
And often the answer is obvious. to 

340
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,780
all of the people who are talking. 

341
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,200
And this stylistic device is mainly 

342
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,380
used as an impressive possessive 

343
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,000
sorry, got problems with the word 

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,620
today device. For example, if you 

345
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,260
prick us, do we not bleed? If you 

346
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,220
tickle us, do we not laugh? If you 

347
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,100
poison us, do we not die? And if you 

348
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,200
wrong us, shall we not revenge? So, 

349
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,220
that's by Shakespeare. And yeah, you 

350
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,840
see, so every... is not a question that 

351
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,500
fights an answer, because the 

352
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,620
answer is obvious. 

353
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,280
For example, if you poison us, 

354
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,860
don't we die? So, of course 

355
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,120
you die then. But 

356
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,360
you probably already know the rhetorical 

357
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,740
question from other topics. So, 

358
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,560
simulating is the comparison, 

359
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,420
the comparisons . It is used to 

360
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,840

361
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,300
compare oneself with different things and 
to 

362
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,600
show the comparisons . and in contrast to 
a 

363
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,760
metaphor, a simile uses the words 

364
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,440
like or as or such as, hence a 

365
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,080
comparison is a direct one. Here we 

366
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,740
learned before that a metaphor is 

367
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,820
implicit or indirect. For example, 

368
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,580
elderly American ladies leaning on 

369
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,320
the canes listed to warn me like 

370
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,600
towers of pizza. You see the like, 

371
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,000
that's a very, very safe indicator 

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,100
for a simile, so quite easy. 

373
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,400
Thank you for your attention. 

374
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,370
Kajic up to here. Exactly. So now 

375
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,510
I'm open to questions. If you want me 

376
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,790
to explain something again or 

377
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,010
explain something again in German 

378
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,670
, right, now is the time 

379
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:57,930
. 

380
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,020
Or feedback or if you 

381
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,780
say, yes please, I 

382
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,550
don't really know anymore. Exactly. So 

383
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,010
feedback is welcome, questions are 
welcome. 

384
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,370
If you don't have any questions, you' 

385
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,870
re also welcome to say goodbye 

386
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,010
, of course. Of course, you 

387
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,310
don't have to stay in the room 
unnecessarily long 

388
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,670
. 

389
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,920
No, okay, it's great that you were here.
